00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.640
Let us in! Let us in!

00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:58.000
Let us in! We need an explanation!

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:58.960
We need an explanation!

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.759
What's going on with you?

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.399
My wife ate hotpot at your Fan Lou.

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.200
Now she's feverish and sweating.

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:06.200
She's vomiting and has diarrhea.

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:08.239
She vomited like it was spraying out.

00:01:08.319 --> 00:01:09.560
She's unconscious now.

00:01:09.879 --> 00:01:10.959
My wife too.

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:12.319
Today.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.799
You—you must give us an explanation!

00:01:14.959 --> 00:01:16.480
Yes, we need an explanation!

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:20.920
Could it be food-induced gastroenteritis?

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.680
No.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.599
You ate at Fan Lou too.

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:32.560
N-no, I didn't.

00:01:39.879 --> 00:01:41.760
Fever, chills, sweating...

00:01:42.879 --> 00:01:43.560
Could it be...

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.760
Quick, lock them up!

00:01:47.879 --> 00:01:48.799
No contact with anyone!

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:49.480
Hurry!

00:01:50.239 --> 00:01:50.640
Hurry!

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:51.280
Quick, quick, quick!

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:51.799
Let me go!

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:53.079
Let go! Hurry, get out!

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.120
What are you doing? Go, now!

00:01:54.239 --> 00:01:55.519
Let me go! Why are you locking us up?

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:56.359
Let me go!

00:01:56.519 --> 00:01:57.079
Go, go, go!

00:01:57.239 --> 00:01:58.480
Let me go! Let us go!

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:59.840
Feifan, what's happening?

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.239
This will affect everyone in the city.

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:02.480
I must go to the palace at once.

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.280
Also, get me some cotton cloth.

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:06.480
I need to make masks.

00:02:06.599 --> 00:02:07.159
Masks?

00:02:07.239 --> 00:02:07.799
Masks?

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:08.840
No time to explain.

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:09.800
I must go to the palace now.

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:10.840
Alright, alright.

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:13.280
Also, keep those two locked together.

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:14.280
No contact with anyone.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.680
Alright.

00:02:14.719 --> 00:02:15.479
Okay, okay.

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:16.199
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.759
Go call someone! Go get help!

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:18.479
Someone, help!

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:53.639
How is the situation?

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.719
How is the Princess?

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:11.800
Your Majesty,

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.120
The Princess may have typhoid fever.

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:15.960
This illness is contagious.

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:17.280
Your Majesty, please step back.

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:18.759
Is there a cure?

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:21.439
I will prescribe some medicine first.

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.080
How confident are you?

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:26.360
About ten or twenty percent.

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:27.520
Ten or twenty percent?

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:29.159
What use are you to me?

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.240
Your Majesty, Young Duke Shi requests an audience.

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.879
Let him in.

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:37.680
Yes.

00:03:47.919 --> 00:03:49.840
Your Majesty, Young Duke Shi is here.

00:03:52.719 --> 00:03:54.879
I believe an epidemic will break out in the capital.

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:56.159
Please issue an order, Your Majesty.

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:57.400
Close the city gates immediately.

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:59.360
An epidemic?

00:03:59.719 --> 00:04:00.960
I think it's very likely.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.919
Your Majesty, I believe

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:05.360
this is very likely an epidemic.

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:06.800
It's what we call malaria.

00:04:06.919 --> 00:04:08.159
This illness can be fatal.

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:09.840
It spreads extremely fast.

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:11.479
Besides closing the gates,

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:13.039
is there any other cure?

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:15.759
I can try to make medicine.

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.680
Good.

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.279
For the Princess and the people,

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:19.959
I order you to make medicine quickly.

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:22.480
Princess.

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:24.759
Why are you still standing there?

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.800
Go make the medicine!

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.800
Curing one is not as good as curing all.

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:30.720
Source, transmission route,

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:31.720
patients—

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.519
If we break any link in the chain,

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:34.839
the epidemic can be stopped.

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:37.319
The most common cause of epidemics

00:04:37.439 --> 00:04:38.600
is transmission by mosquitoes.

00:04:39.399 --> 00:04:40.079
Mosquitoes?

00:04:40.959 --> 00:04:41.480
Exactly.

00:04:42.319 --> 00:04:43.399
I beg Your Majesty to order

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:46.079
every household to burn incense to repel mosquitoes.

00:04:46.439 --> 00:04:47.720
Clear all areas of standing water.

00:04:48.319 --> 00:04:49.639
Close the city gates immediately.

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:50.560
Absurd!

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:55.720
Please reconsider, Your Majesty.

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:58.920
Closing the gates may cause panic.

00:04:59.319 --> 00:04:59.920
Besides,

00:05:00.279 --> 00:05:02.160
I've never heard

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.839
that Young Duke Shi knows the art of healing.

00:05:05.959 --> 00:05:07.160
Prince Qing has so many doubts.

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:08.879
Why don't you do it?

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:09.639
You—

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:13.040
Prince Qing is right.

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:14.480
If we really close the gates,

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:16.040
the people will surely be suspicious.

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.399
Better to cure the Princess first, then discuss.

00:05:23.439 --> 00:05:24.319
In your opinion,

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:27.319
how should the Princess be treated?

00:05:29.079 --> 00:05:29.720
Your Majesty,

00:05:30.439 --> 00:05:32.040
I have found a way to make medicine.

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:33.959
If conditions allow,

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:35.279
she'll improve in a few days.

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:36.839
Then hurry and make the medicine!

00:05:37.079 --> 00:05:37.639
No!

00:05:38.079 --> 00:05:39.160
How dare you, Shi Feifan!

00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:40.759
You dare deceive His Majesty!

00:05:52.959 --> 00:05:54.920
Oh no! The Princess has fainted!

00:05:55.639 --> 00:05:56.399
Why are you still standing there?

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:57.079
Go quickly!

00:06:15.439 --> 00:06:16.560
How is the Princess now?

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:17.959
Earlier, I

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:19.720
gave the Princess San Gen Cao juice.

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:21.879
She shouldn't be like this.

00:06:22.199 --> 00:06:22.879
Speak honestly.

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:24.639
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

00:06:25.079 --> 00:06:26.720
If the Princess doesn't wake today,

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:29.600
I'm afraid she won't last long.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.079
Quack!

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:32.879
They're all quacks!

00:06:35.639 --> 00:06:36.199
You go!

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:38.360
Me?

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:38.959
Go quickly!

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:10.360
It's you.

00:07:13.839 --> 00:07:14.920
So you are the Princess.

00:07:19.439 --> 00:07:20.399
The Princess is awake.

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:32.600
Still not back yet?

00:07:33.839 --> 00:07:34.839
Duke, please don't worry.

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:36.920
It's already so late.

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:38.920
Why isn't Feifan back yet?

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:42.040
Duke, Duke, please don't worry.

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:45.519
Since Young Duke found a way to repel mosquitoes,

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:47.240
he should be fine.

00:07:47.439 --> 00:07:48.120
Don't worry.

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:51.360
Young Duke.

00:07:52.079 --> 00:07:52.560
Feifan! Father!

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:53.160
Young Duke.

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:54.959
Safe and sound.

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:56.759
Go tidy up the guest room.

00:07:57.279 --> 00:07:58.480
Take the Princess to rest in the guest room.

00:07:58.639 --> 00:07:59.160
Alright!

00:08:10.319 --> 00:08:10.959
Princess, be careful.

00:08:15.079 --> 00:08:15.639
Feifan.

00:08:16.759 --> 00:08:17.279
Feifan.

00:08:19.639 --> 00:08:21.680
Why did you bring the Princess here?

00:08:22.519 --> 00:08:23.600
The Princess caught the epidemic.

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:25.519
The imperial doctors couldn't cure her.

00:08:25.959 --> 00:08:27.759
His Majesty asked me to treat the Princess.

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:32.120
Feifan, are you out of your mind?

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.799
If even the imperial doctors failed,

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:37.480
how could you promise His Majesty?

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:39.879
What if...

00:08:40.879 --> 00:08:41.720
I mean, what if...

00:08:42.559 --> 00:08:44.360
What if you can't cure her?

00:08:44.559 --> 00:08:46.840
Our Duke's Mansion will be doomed!

00:08:47.519 --> 00:08:51.000
Father, please rest assured.

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:54.399
This is our chance to change our fate.

00:08:55.639 --> 00:08:56.279
Besides,

00:08:58.919 --> 00:09:00.200
I can't betray her trust.

00:09:10.519 --> 00:09:11.279
It's you.

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:19.919
Even if you cure the Princess,

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:22.120
if everyone finds out

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:24.159
the Princess stayed at our mansion,

00:09:24.919 --> 00:09:26.919
it will harm your reputation.

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:30.240
Father, isn't it the other way around?

00:09:30.759 --> 00:09:31.720
What do you know?

00:09:32.919 --> 00:09:35.440
A man's reputation matters too!

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:36.320
Th-this...

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:38.120
Th-this...

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:39.799
How about this:

00:09:40.759 --> 00:09:42.879
Beg His Majesty for mercy, admit fault,

00:09:43.679 --> 00:09:45.759
and send the Princess back.

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:50.120
At a time like this,

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:51.480
you can still laugh?

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:54.559
Father.

00:10:03.799 --> 00:10:04.399
Father.

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:08.080
A woman's reputation matters too.

00:10:11.159 --> 00:10:12.759
You brat!

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:28.480
Feifan.

00:10:29.639 --> 00:10:30.519
How is the Princess?

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:32.639
San Gen Cao is holding it off for now.

00:10:33.759 --> 00:10:35.000
San Gen Cao?

00:10:35.559 --> 00:10:37.279
I heard the imperial doctors tried it.

00:10:37.919 --> 00:10:39.320
It didn't work well.

00:10:40.519 --> 00:10:42.320
It loses effect when heated.

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:44.240
But I have another way.

00:10:46.039 --> 00:10:47.000
As long as you have a way.

00:10:47.759 --> 00:10:49.639
Father, what did you find out?

00:10:51.639 --> 00:10:53.360
The first few patients

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:55.600
all watched the monkey show on the street.

00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:57.039
And the monkey

00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:59.600
came from the hot Ri Nan Jun Guo.

00:10:59.759 --> 00:11:01.759
Now it's barely alive.

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:05.360
Have we ever traded with them?

00:11:06.679 --> 00:11:07.639
No, we haven't.

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:13.879
You mean...

00:11:14.039 --> 00:11:14.519
Exactly.

00:11:16.559 --> 00:11:18.120
But whoever is behind this,

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:20.039
won't be found so easily.

00:11:20.759 --> 00:11:23.039
Right now, making the medicine is key.

00:11:23.679 --> 00:11:24.559
As for the rest,

00:11:25.039 --> 00:11:26.399
we can settle it later.

00:11:32.679 --> 00:11:34.440
The epidemic is raging now.

00:11:34.679 --> 00:11:35.919
Everyone, take care of yourselves.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:37.559
Stay safe.

00:11:37.879 --> 00:11:39.799
Take people to burn mugwort in every room and yard.

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:40.600
Understood.

00:11:41.399 --> 00:11:41.879
Egg Yolk Pie.

00:11:42.799 --> 00:11:43.840
Lead people to clear standing water.

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:45.600
Cover all drinking water.

00:11:46.039 --> 00:11:46.519
Yes.

00:11:47.399 --> 00:11:48.000
Meat Floss Pie.

00:11:48.759 --> 00:11:50.000
Give Artemisia juice to those in quarantine.

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:50.879
Feed them Artemisia juice.

00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:51.559
Yes.

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:53.480
Go ahead.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.000
Be sure to protect yourself.

00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:56.799
Yes.

00:12:06.399 --> 00:12:06.919
Young Duke.

00:12:09.799 --> 00:12:10.320
Feifan.

00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:12.200
Is this wine for...

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:12.960
Father.

00:12:13.399 --> 00:12:16.519
I'm purifying a crucial substance.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.440
Feifan, tell me the truth.

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:20.960
These fuzzy things,

00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:22.519
these green grasses,

00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:24.480
are all for making medicine?

00:12:24.679 --> 00:12:25.159
Yes.

00:12:26.559 --> 00:12:27.679
San Gen Cao cures the epidemic.

00:12:27.879 --> 00:12:29.120
Fresh grass juice works best.

00:12:29.759 --> 00:12:31.159
But for better results,

00:12:31.639 --> 00:12:32.759
the juice needs to be purified.

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:34.279
With limited resources now,

00:12:34.679 --> 00:12:36.159
this is the best method.

00:12:40.639 --> 00:12:42.080
Notify the Four Great Medicine Merchants:

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:44.679
No one is allowed to sell medicine to the Duke's Mansion.

00:12:48.279 --> 00:12:50.480
Let him struggle for a while.

00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:52.840
He'll be blamed for delayed treatment.

00:12:53.919 --> 00:12:54.679
Interesting.

00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:57.039
Very interesting.

00:12:58.919 --> 00:12:59.440
Yes.

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:09.759
Safe and sound.

00:13:11.639 --> 00:13:12.519
Go to the medicine shop.

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:14.080
Buy some San Gen Cao.

00:13:14.279 --> 00:13:15.360
Alright, I'll go now.

00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:29.840
Miss.

00:13:30.399 --> 00:13:31.799
Are you really sending these precious herbs

00:13:31.879 --> 00:13:32.879
to the Duke's Mansion?

00:13:33.799 --> 00:13:34.840
Just returning them to their owner.

00:13:40.799 --> 00:13:42.279
If they can make a cure,

00:13:43.159 --> 00:13:44.480
it would be a blessing.

00:13:52.399 --> 00:13:53.360
Go on, go on, there's really none left.

00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:54.120
You...

00:13:54.279 --> 00:13:56.080
Boss, why not do business with him?

00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:56.919
What do you know?

00:13:57.080 --> 00:13:58.279
The Four Great Medicine Merchants have spoken.

00:13:58.440 --> 00:13:59.600
If we don't listen to them,

00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:02.039
this shop won't last.

00:14:02.159 --> 00:14:02.879
Get back to work.

00:14:04.399 --> 00:14:06.320
Making medicine is crucial now.

00:14:06.519 --> 00:14:08.720
Don't let Young Duke get distracted.

00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:12.440
There must be another way.
