Hey, are you okay?

Whoa!

JaneWill!

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.960
Hey, are you alright?

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.080
Hey, are you in there?

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.400
- Jane!
- You haven't answered our calls or texts.

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:17.620
JaneWill!

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:23.680
Hey, are you okay?

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.080
Hello?

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:28.680
Hey!

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.840
- Hey!
- JaneWill!

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.120
Oh, my...

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.280
Are you okay?

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:51.800
Look at you.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.480
- Alright.
- Let's get inside.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:56.840
Come on, let me help you.

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.520
Move.

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:00.120
Come on.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:01.560
Gosh, look at you.

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:02.760
Jeez, the shoes!

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:03.960
Oh, my God.

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.526
Why don't you put them away?

00:02:06.566 --> 00:02:07.360
Come on.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.400
You stink.

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.080
Jeez,

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.640
I bet you haven't even taken a shower.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:21.520
Don't tell me...

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.480
you had alcohol last night.

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.320
It wouldn't be milk tea, would it?

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.000
Hey!

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.480
Stop getting on my nerves.

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:29.760
I'm just worried about you.

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.160
Well, I had a few drinks.

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.160
A few drinks,

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:37.520
and you're completely wasted.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.040
If you'd had more than that,

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.160
I bet you would've run around naked.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.880
Exactly.

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.289
Don't you think you're too fine now?

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:48.640
Why?

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.760
Wait,

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.240
you haven't seen the video, have you?

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:54.620
What video?

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.000
Video games?

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.480
Stop fooling around, will you?

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.880
That video of you and Dai
is going viral now.

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:04.240
A video?!

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:05.300
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:15.240
Wait...

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.840
This must be a dream within a dream.

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.280
Wake up! Wake up now!

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.080
Did you get this from my dream?

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.960
It's exactly like my dream last night.

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.000
Jeez, stop being silly.

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:29.920
What dream are you talking about?

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:31.840
You and Dai actually kissed.

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:34.400
It has over a thousand views now.

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:36.240
Oh, my...

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:37.560
Here.

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:39.840
See for yourself.

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:45.320
It hurts.

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:46.520
'Cause we're not in a dream.

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:48.920
Gosh...

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:16.920
The photo doesn't match.

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:18.480
Don't smile.

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:19.960
Now frown.

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:22.680
Are you serious?

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:25.200
Are you sure
this isn't someone else's ID card?

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:28.600
You mean she looks too pale, right?

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:35.559
Here.

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.080
She looks exactly like the photo, right?

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:43.080
She just didn't have
her makeup on, you know.

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:44.520
That's why she looked different.

00:05:49.693 --> 00:05:51.433
Cheers!

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:58.600
[Nene, the fourth-year peer mentor]

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:03.920
Coming to a pub without drinking?

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:06.417
That's no fun at all, kid!

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:08.720
Come on,

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:10.280
she's just a freshman.

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:12.280
[France, the third-year peer mentor]

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:14.200
It's your first time
at a pub, too, right?

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:15.560
That's right.

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:17.800
If you haven't tried alcohol before,

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:19.340
you'd better not try it here,

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:20.760
or you might get too drunk
to make it home.

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:23.680
Don't worry about that, France.

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:25.560
Nene and I brought her here,

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:26.840
so we're taking care of her.

[Mommy]

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:42.680
Uh...

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:44.000
It's my mom.

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:45.360
Please excuse me for a moment.

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:13.080
I totally forgot I told her

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:15.560
I'd come home
to get more clothes this week.

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:22.120
Yes?

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:24.320
What took you so long to pick up?

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:25.540
Were you asleep?

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:27.000
No,

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:28.480
I wasn't.

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:30.080
What is it, Mom?

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:32.240
I was gonna ask

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:34.000
what time
you're coming home tomorrow.

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:35.520
If it's in the morning,

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:37.920
I'll make some shrimp porridge for you.

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:42.480
I think I'll be there around noon.

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:44.800
If it's at noon,

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:46.560
then what do you want for lunch?

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:48.320
Uh...

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:50.373
Anything's fine.

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:52.040
Uh,

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:53.600
- I'm sleepy now.
- You took forever!

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:54.800
- Goodbye, Mom.
- Sorry,

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:56.840
- my car broke down.
- Wait, don't hang up yet.

00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:57.840
Hurry.

00:07:57.880 --> 00:07:59.640
Why am I hearing guys in your room?

00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:02.200
No one's here.

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:03.800
It's probably the TV.

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:05.760
What channel are you watching?

00:08:06.753 --> 00:08:08.000
It's...

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:09.240
I'm not sure,

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:11.640
but it's a wildlife documentary.

00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:14.200
A wildlife documentary...

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:16.560
with guys and music?

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:18.080
Well...

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:19.120
I'm...

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:20.600
I'm...

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:23.880
I'm taking a music class
in Thonglor, Mom!

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:24.800
What?!

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:27.800
You're out
drinking with friends, aren't you?

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:30.031
No! They're my seniors.

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.040
Are they men or women?

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:37.040
Well, there are both of them.

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:39.480
I'm not drinking, though.

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:42.440
And they're very nice to me.

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:44.380
I'm completely safe, Mom.

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:47.565
I know you love me,

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:50.440
and I love you so much, too.

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:53.560
Don't stay out too late, okay?

00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:55.600
Got it, Mom.

00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:59.520
I'll text you
as soon as I get to my room.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.200
Jane's never been irresponsible.

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:13.400
I think you can trust her.

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:26.400
Dai?

00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:29.160
JaneWill!

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:34.720
It's really you.

00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:37.240
Aren't you too young?

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:38.280
How did you get in?

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:44.040
But that makeup...

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:45.640
makes you look older.

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:51.640
Do you smoke?

00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:57.160
You don't like smokers, do you?

00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:00.440
I don't mind people who smoke.

00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:02.600
I just can't stand the smell.

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:05.840
My brother once got his heart broken

00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:07.760
and started smoking like crazy.

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:10.840
He smoked all day. His lips turned dark,
and he smelled terrible.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.240
I couldn't handle it,

00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:13.560
so I told him to quit.

00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:19.400
Wait, why are you putting it out?

00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:21.520
Because you don't like it.

00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:25.160
It shouldn't matter to you.

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:26.720
We're not that close anyway.

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:28.120
I'm about to leave, too.

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:29.560
Well,

00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:31.720
I was gonna quit anyway.

00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:34.140
Good, then.

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:36.920
Right.

00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:38.880
Dai...

00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:40.640
Yes?

00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:44.440
Can you stop calling me "JaneWill"?

00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:48.160
What should I call you, then?

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:50.360
The Queen of FA?

00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:52.480
Or should I call you by your student ID?

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:55.560
Just call me Jane.

00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:57.000
Whoa...

00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:59.040
That sounds even longer, no?

00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:02.000
"Just call me Jane."

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:10.360
What's so funny?

00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:12.152
Nothing.

00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:21.400
Just thinking about it pisses me off.

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:23.920
If I'd known he was a flirt,

00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:27.480
I wouldn't have let him smash me.

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:31.240
Smash?

00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:32.640
What does that mean?

00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:35.840
It means getting laid.

00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:36.680
Sorry?

00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:38.120
Hooking up, you know.

00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:43.160
I'll show you.

00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:44.720
This.

00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:47.920
And this.

00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:53.760
I get it now.

00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:02.040
I slept with him,
and now I'm sitting here crying.

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:05.480
A guy that cruel...

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
deserves to have his thing cut off!

00:12:09.126 --> 00:12:12.346
I'll cut it off, snip, snip, snip.

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:15.560
Alright.

00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:20.080
Bottoms up!

00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:21.240
Come on.

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:25.200
Here's to my crappy boyfriend!

00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:28.760
Cheers!

00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:38.640
Drink up.

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:40.140
Should I?

00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:50.000
Finish it off.

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:52.280
Finish it!

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:55.640
If you're hanging out with us,

00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:58.520
you need to handle your liquor.

00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:00.480
Drink!

00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:01.800
That's enough, Nene.

00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:03.920
She's just started.

00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:05.800
Don't rush her.

00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:07.560
Are you good, Jane?

00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:10.640
If it's bitter,

00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:12.080
mix it with some soda.

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:12.880
Come on.

00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:14.080
It'll go down easier.

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:21.200
Bottoms up!

00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:22.840
Bottoms up!

00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:23.800
Come on.

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:26.480
- Yay!
- Cheers!

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.000
Keep going.

00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:41.520
Come on!

00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:43.360
Calm yourself down!

00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:45.640
So, how exactly did you go that far?

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.760
I have no idea.

00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:52.760
The last thing I remember is
I was drinking with my peer mentors.

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:54.840
What really surprised me...

00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:57.444
is that outfit you wore to the pub.

00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:00.000
It's so freaking white.

00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:01.800
Like you were going to
some kind of meditation.

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:07.240
Cake!

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:09.800
Aw, I'm sorry.

00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:12.680
It's your fault for cracking me up.

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:20.920
I have to apologize to Dai.

00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:32.040
Dai!

00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:34.320
I'm sorry.

00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:40.280
Hey, stop that.

00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:43.560
Grown-ups don't cry.

00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:44.960
Come on.

00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:47.640
Let's drink.

00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:50.480
Cheers!

00:14:58.680 --> 00:14:59.880
That's enough, Jane.

00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:02.680
Okie. This...

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:04.680
is my last shot.

00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:24.960
One more!

00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:31.600
One more.

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:34.240
One more.

00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:37.840
One more.

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:42.040
One more!

00:15:48.703 --> 00:15:49.703
One more.

00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:12.160
You're talking in circles.

00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:13.980
Will you ever finish the story?

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:17.920
That's all I can remember.

00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:20.400
If you can't remember anything,

00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:22.080
then how did you get back to your room?

00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:22.900
Right.

00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:26.120
How did I?

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:27.640
I don't remember that.

00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:29.760
I'll just ask Meen.

00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:35.400
She's probably still asleep.

00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:37.880
I'll call her in the evening.

00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:42.960
Do you think...

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:44.920
my mom's seen the video?

00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:47.200
If you're worried about that,

00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:48.780
let me handle it.

00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:51.120
What are you doing?

00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:54.040
Hi.

00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:56.560
Hello?

00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:04.720
Hello.

00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:06.680
I'm a friend of the girl in the video.

00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:12.640
Isn't she hot?

00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:14.080
Whoa, look at that.

00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:17.400
Hey.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:18.840
Come here.

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:20.200
Have you seen this?

00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:21.440
- What?
- Look.

00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:23.040
It's the campus queen.

00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:25.420
Look at this.

00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:26.800
Here.

00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:30.000
The girl we can see clearly
is an architecture sophomore.

00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:32.240
She's so hot.

00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:33.520
I know her.

00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:34.400
Isn't she hot?

00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:38.880
But the other girl...

00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:41.000
I'm not sure
if she's studying at Wonder University.

00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:43.120
- Hey, Champ.
- What?

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:44.360
Do you know her?

00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:45.600
Do you?

00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:49.800
Oh...

00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:53.480
Hey, is your head okay?

00:17:53.660 --> 00:17:55.240
It's okay. I'm fine.

00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:56.400
Sorry.

00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:03.880
Why does it matter?

00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:05.080
Come on.

00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:06.600
She's pretty, man.

00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:08.240
She has nothing to do with us.

00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:10.040
But she's pretty.

00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:13.200
Look at your buddy.

00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:14.880
Hey!

00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:16.200
Why would you ask him?

00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:18.280
You know he hates
poking into people's stuff.

00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:20.840
Am I really wrong for being curious?

00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:22.480
Am I?

00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:24.640
Look at him.

00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:25.800
He's keeping things from me.

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:28.400
She's pretty hot, though.

00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:30.160
Gosh, it's hot.

00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:31.280
It is.

00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:32.480
My eyes hurt.

00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:33.640
- Cover?
- Let's go.

00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:34.800
Get in the shade.

00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:37.520
We'll drop you here.

00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:39.000
Yeah, right.

00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:39.960
I'm leaving.

00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:43.640
Will he really delete the video?

00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:45.400
He definitely will.

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:47.200
He even said he was sorry.

00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:49.480
He only posted it
'cause he thought it was cute.

00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:51.520
Can we really trust him?

00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:53.840
I know his number,

00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:56.000
his social media, and even his address.

00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:59.040
And I know
he's studying at a university nearby.

00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:01.920
If he doesn't delete it,
I'll go to his home.

00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:04.840
You're the best, huh?

00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:06.120
- Well...
- You love your friend...

00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:07.720
more than anyone, huh?

00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:10.240
- Of course.
- But are you sure

00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:11.680
you're doing this

00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:13.280
for your friend

00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:14.800
and not...

00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:16.040
yourself?

00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:18.000
Hey, come on.

00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:20.720
I do love my friend, Waii,

00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:24.200
but when it comes to guys...
It happens,

00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:25.160
you know.

00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:28.480
Gosh, it's hot.

00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:33.520
Don't worry, okay?

00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:34.760
It's gonna be okay.

00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:36.420
If you want anything,

00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:37.840
text me.

00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:38.880
Right.

00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:40.200
We're leaving now.

00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:43.720
Have some rest, alright?

00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:45.800
- Bye-bye.
- Can you be on your own?

00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:48.000
Yeah, I can.

00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:49.720
Alright, bye.

00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:50.880
- See you.
- Bye-bye.

00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:54.080
Let's go.

00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:07.840
Darin, check this out.

00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:11.760
Too blurry.

00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:13.440
That's what you get for sneaky filming.

00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:17.240
Wait, so it's true?

00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:22.160
It is, and that's me,

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:23.480
not my double.

00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:24.640
Why?

00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:28.240
Fine. If you're good,
then it's nothing.

00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:29.840
That's it, then.

00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:35.940
Gosh,

00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:38.560
why does it have to turn out this way?

00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:41.560
I'm going crazy.

00:20:58.160 --> 00:20:59.840
Oh, it's Dai.

00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:04.240
What are you sorry for this time?

00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:08.360
Why is she acting
like she doesn't remember?

00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:11.440
Is she testing me,

00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:14.160
or is she so mad
that she's being sarcastic?

00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:16.460
I'm really sorry.

00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:18.560
I didn't mean it.

00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:19.720
[I'm really sorry]

00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:21.280
[I didn't mean it]

00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:24.800
I have no idea what's going on.

00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:26.680
[I have no idea what's going on]

00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:29.160
By the way,

00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:31.520
do you happen to like donuts?

00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:38.400
What? Why is she talking
about something else now?

00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:44.840
If it's edible,

00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:46.680
it's my favorite.

00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:55.900
Come help me finish these donuts.

00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:59.640
I bought them
on a buy-one-get-one deal,

00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:01.160
but if I eat them all,
I'll definitely gain weight.

00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:03.360
Are you worried
about gaining weight, too?

00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:11.320
Give me some time to dress up.

00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:13.340
I'm actually about to go home.

00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:53.480
Have a seat, Jane.

00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:16.720
Thank you.

00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:19.920
Well...

00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:21.600
I...

00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:24.600
You can talk to me
like you did last night.

00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:25.880
It was cute.

00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:29.520
I'm sorry I crossed the line, Gai!

00:23:30.220 --> 00:23:31.080
It's Dai,

00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:32.120
not Gai.

00:23:33.220 --> 00:23:34.360
I'm sorry, Gai!

00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:36.680
I'm Dai.

00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:37.720
Calm down, okay?

00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:41.880
I'm sorry...

00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:42.920
Dai.

00:23:43.940 --> 00:23:47.640
I must have upset you.

00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:49.840
Really? Have you?

00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:51.560
I have!

00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:52.760
You haven't.

00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:54.640
Yes, I have.

00:23:56.560 --> 00:23:57.560
No, you haven't.

00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:00.640
I have.

00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:03.680
I kissed you when I was drunk.

00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:07.240
That's not what happened.

00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:10.240
You were drunk,
told me I had beautiful eyes,

00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:12.480
and then leaned in close.

00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:13.760
That's all.

00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:21.640
What did you just say?

00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:25.240
What made you think
you crossed the line?

00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:32.160
Is it the video?

00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:57.080
Isn't that the Queen of FA?

00:24:58.220 --> 00:24:59.560
Looks like she's really drunk.

00:25:02.340 --> 00:25:03.520
I think you're right.

00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:04.560
I'll go check on her.

00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:20.720
You have beautiful eyes,

00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:27.920
gorgeous...

00:25:29.140 --> 00:25:31.920
I wish I had eyes as beautiful as yours.

00:25:39.820 --> 00:25:42.280
Hey, you can't film them.
That's rude.

00:25:42.770 --> 00:25:43.720
Why can't I?

00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:45.320
It's kinda cute. Look.

00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:00.320
JaneWill!

00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:01.840
- We're sorry.
- We're really sorry.

00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:03.400
- Jane... Hey!
- It's okay. I don't mind.

00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:04.840
- We're really sorry.
- It's okay.

00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:05.720
Let's go.

00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:06.480
- Jane...
- We're really sorry.

00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:07.280
Are you okay?

00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:08.480
Oh, gosh.

00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:12.240
You didn't cross any lines, Jane.

00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:13.920
You were drunk

00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:15.240
and told me,

00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:17.920
"You have beautiful eyes, gorgeous.

00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:19.600
I wish I had eyes
as beautiful as yours."

00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:22.000
You didn't do anything at all,

00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:24.960
and you nearly puked on me.

00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:30.960
Please excuse me.

00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:32.760
I gotta go to a somtam place.

00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:34.240
I'm craving somtam.

00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:35.920
Aren't you going home anymore?

00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:38.680
I'll go home first and then head there!

00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:56.840
You're so cute, Jane.

00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:04.120
Hey!

00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:07.480
How come she's this wasted?

00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:08.720
Come on.

00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:13.000
Hurry!

00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:14.160
Will they be okay?

00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:15.480
Jane!

00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:20.960
Hey, is your friend okay?

00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:23.920
She's just drunk. Nothing serious.

00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:26.280
Anything I can do to help?

00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:27.600
We're good, sir.

00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:29.800
It's her first time drinking, you know.

00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:31.360
That's right.

00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:32.640
At 19,

00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:35.520
it's impressive
how much she could drink.

00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:39.690
When I had my first drink at 19,

00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:41.960
I couldn't even walk straight home.

00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:43.440
Okay...

00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:45.520
Oh, that's our ride.

00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:48.040
Nene, I'll take Jane to her dorm

00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:49.080
and leave after that.

00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:49.880
- Okay.
- Sounds good?

00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:50.560
Come on.

00:27:53.140 --> 00:27:54.200
Get in, Jane.

00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:01.530
- Make sure she gets to her room.
- Help!

00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:04.960
How old is that girl?

00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:07.080
She's 19, sir.

00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:12.200
I think you need to talk to the owner.

00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:13.680
This way.

00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:14.960
Okay.

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:15.840
Please.

00:28:17.260 --> 00:28:19.680
- The owner?
- Yes. This way.

00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:20.600
Alright.

00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:30.360
You puked on her?

00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:31.600
Yeah.

00:28:33.410 --> 00:28:35.920
- Come on.
- You're amazing, sis.

00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:36.800
- Look,
- I can't.

00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:39.040
what's so funny about it?

00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:40.480
It's embarrassing.

00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:41.960
Well, it is funny.

00:28:42.290 --> 00:28:44.640
Wow, your first drink
was memorable, huh?

00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:46.920
Look,

00:28:47.140 --> 00:28:48.400
as your brother, let me tell you this.

00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:52.000
Next time you drink,
don't mix soda with alcohol.

00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:53.720
It goes down easy,

00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:55.720
but it also hits you quickly.

00:28:57.240 --> 00:28:58.960
What are you guys talking about?

00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:01.040
You're being loud.

00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:04.280
There's something funny, Mom.

00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:05.720
Something funny?

00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:08.280
What is it? Tell me about it.

00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:10.880
It's not funny, Mom.

00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:12.240
Let's go.

00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:14.920
- What?
- Let's cook me some food.

00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:16.400
- What's with you?
- I'm sick of them.

00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:18.440
You had something just now.

00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:19.880
I want an omelet.

00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:21.560
Don't cook for them.

00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:24.480
Honey!

00:29:25.060 --> 00:29:26.840
We're about to have lunch,

00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:28.640
and you're having a donut?

00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:31.600
Oh, come on.

00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:32.640
Put it down.

00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:35.600
Well...

00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:37.960
I mean,

00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:41.120
I've been craving this.

00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:42.830
I've told you several times
to get me some,

00:29:42.850 --> 00:29:44.430
but you never did!

00:29:47.140 --> 00:29:48.920
Your blood sugar's gonna go up.

00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:51.360
Didn't the doctor tell you
to cut down on sugar?

00:29:53.190 --> 00:29:55.960
Just a little won't hurt, Mom.

00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:57.600
Right, Dad?

00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:01.960
Just a little.

00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:07.840
Whoa!

00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:11.240
You're enjoying it, huh?

00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:12.880
This is my favorite.

00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:15.080
That's a big bite.

00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:16.760
Look at you.

00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:17.720
Here, sweetie.

00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:19.800
This is 200 baht.

00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:21.720
It's for the donuts.

00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:22.600
Thanks, Dad.

00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:24.400
So you won't run out of money for meals.

00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:27.880
All the dishes have been served.

00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:28.880
You can dig in now.

00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:31.560
Jimmy, Junior, go ahead.

00:30:31.580 --> 00:30:32.410
Mhm, sure.

00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:34.960
Alright, let's eat, guys.

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:36.160
Can I have one, Dad?

00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:37.440
Sure, take it.

00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:38.760
- Have some.
- It looks amazing.

00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:41.840
Make sure you leave some
for your sisters, too.

00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:43.170
- Alright?
- Got it.

00:30:43.770 --> 00:30:44.870
Thanks.

00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:46.640
I don't want any food now, honey.

00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:49.280
- Gosh.
- This is good.

00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:50.160
It sure is.

00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:51.160
Thanks.

00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:52.400
Right, Junior,

00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:56.360
when will you finally have time
to translate my book?

00:30:56.680 --> 00:30:57.840
Well,

00:30:57.880 --> 00:31:00.520
I need two more weeks
to finish my current project.

00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:05.840
And the company's sending me
a documentary script next,

00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:06.880
so it'll take a while.

00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:09.480
Whoa! Oh, come on!

00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:12.040
Mine is just five pages.

00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:16.240
And I'm not making you do it for free.

00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:20.200
I'm paying you
the same rate everyone else does.

00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:21.600
I know,

00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:23.040
but you gotta wait until it's your turn.

00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:25.640
Fine, then. Alright.

00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:29.840
What about you, Jimmy?

00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:31.440
How's your job going, son?

00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:35.120
It's just okay.

00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:37.800
A white-collar job, you know.
Clock in at 8,

00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:38.960
clock out at 4.

00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:40.640
No bonuses at all.

00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:42.720
At least there's OT.

00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:46.080
I'm actually kinda tired of it now.

00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:47.960
I'll probably get a new job next year.

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:48.720
What?

00:31:49.260 --> 00:31:50.960
What exactly is this new job?

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:53.840
If you don't have one yet, don't quit.

00:31:54.220 --> 00:31:56.700
I heard it's hard
to find a job these days.

00:31:56.740 --> 00:31:58.040
Yeah.

00:31:58.200 --> 00:31:59.880
Mom's right, son.

00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:01.960
Jobs are hard to find now.

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:03.640
You'd better not quit

00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:06.700
unless you've got
a new job waiting, alright?

00:32:06.820 --> 00:32:08.600
If you end up unemployed
with no income,

00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:11.520
you'll be in serious trouble, son.

00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:17.240
My airline laid off
almost a hundred employees last month.

00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:18.600
Whoa...

00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:21.400
I was just complaining.

00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:23.000
I'm not actually quitting.

00:32:23.180 --> 00:32:24.640
Guess I'll put up with it for now.

00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:28.360
I don't want to rely on you
for money again.

00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:32.680
I'm not worried about that at all.

00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:34.360
With four children,

00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:36.520
even if we had to support you forever,

00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:39.440
your dad could handle it.

00:32:41.620 --> 00:32:44.360
What? Why only me, honey?

00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:46.440
Well, you're the head of the family.

00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:47.320
What?

00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:49.840
You're our hero, Dad.

00:32:50.090 --> 00:32:52.360
- Yay!
- Yay!

00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:54.040
That's right!

00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:55.160
You're amazing, Dad.

00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:56.480
Our hero!

00:32:57.800 --> 00:32:59.480
I'm handling it all alone, huh?

00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:02.440
Let's do this.

00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:04.760

00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:24.800
Are you working tomorrow, Juss?

00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:27.880
I'm off on Mondays this month.

00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:30.720
Don't you have class tomorrow?

00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:32.040
Why are you staying home tonight?

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:34.160
I've got one in the afternoon,

00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:36.290
but the professor
gave us an assignment,

00:33:36.310 --> 00:33:37.480
so we don't have to go.

00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:41.240

00:33:43.820 --> 00:33:45.080
Well...

00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:47.720

I have to join
a 3-day, 2-night training camp.

00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:15.640
That sounds fun.

It's not!

00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:20.440
I don't want to go,

00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:23.280
and I never cared
about being the Queen of FA anyway.

00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:24.880
This sucks.

00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:26.080

Wow! I'm glad
you're my roommate, JaneWill.

right?

Thanks.

00:43:12.760 --> 00:43:15.280
It's actually nice that
I get to share a room with her.

00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:17.680
Gives me the perfect chance
to ask about Dai.

00:43:25.740 --> 00:43:26.640
What?

00:43:29.600 --> 00:43:30.600
Nothing.

00:43:32.840 --> 00:43:34.820
Hey, Dear.

00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:37.400
Do you ever talk to Dai?

00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:40.720
Pretty often, like a few times a week.

00:43:42.390 --> 00:43:44.120
A few times...

00:43:46.520 --> 00:43:47.920
I see.

00:43:47.960 --> 00:43:54.000
Has she ever told you
whether she hates anyone right now?

00:43:55.240 --> 00:43:56.560
Well...

00:43:57.600 --> 00:43:59.320
I don't know nothin' 'bout that.

00:43:59.480 --> 00:44:00.880
I ain't feelin' it, so...

00:44:04.080 --> 00:44:05.720
What did she mean
she didn't know nothin'?

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:08.240
And she ain't feelin' it?

00:44:09.400 --> 00:44:11.240
What did she mean?

00:44:11.880 --> 00:44:13.920
It must be some sort of secret.

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:19.080
What?
Why you lookin' at me like that?

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:22.520
I was waiting for you to finish.

00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:25.800
No, that's it.

00:44:25.840 --> 00:44:27.000
I'm done talkin'.

00:44:27.400 --> 00:44:28.400
You're done?

00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:29.360
Yeah.

00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:32.040
That's not true.

00:44:32.350 --> 00:44:36.030
She ended her sentence with "so..."

00:44:36.320 --> 00:44:39.080
I'm sure
she almost let something slip for sure,

00:44:40.240 --> 00:44:44.000
but someone must've told her
to keep quiet.

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:48.040
I knew Dai was sneaky.

00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:50.880
She's the ultimate villain.

00:44:57.800 --> 00:45:00.400
I made you egg fried rice.
It's on the table.

00:45:01.960 --> 00:45:03.520
Egg fried rice again?

00:45:04.420 --> 00:45:06.400
There's also a stuffed omelet.

00:45:07.340 --> 00:45:09.720
So, what are you making?

00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:11.640
Fried boiled eggs with tamarind sauce.

00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:14.360
Why is everything eggs, Mom?

00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:15.400
Do you have anything else?

00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:17.600
We're gonna end up malnourished.

00:45:19.040 --> 00:45:21.040
There's clear soup with tofu.

00:45:21.080 --> 00:45:23.000
I added some eggs, though,

00:45:23.040 --> 00:45:24.040
to make it taste better.

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:28.680
Today's a holy day,

00:45:28.720 --> 00:45:31.000
so I want us to skip meat.

00:45:31.040 --> 00:45:32.400
It's a way to make merit

00:45:32.720 --> 00:45:34.600
and keep animals from being killed.

00:45:34.840 --> 00:45:37.480
- Sadhu.
- Sadhu.

00:45:38.360 --> 00:45:39.600
I'm off to work.

00:45:39.640 --> 00:45:40.720
Eat before you go, sweetie.

00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:42.560
I've made plenty of yummy dishes.

00:45:43.640 --> 00:45:45.040
They're all eggs.

00:45:45.630 --> 00:45:47.710
I must go now, or I'll be late.

00:45:47.960 --> 00:45:50.320
You guys can have it all,
Jimmy and Junior.

00:45:50.360 --> 00:45:51.280
Don't save any for me.

00:45:51.320 --> 00:45:51.980
Bye.

00:45:54.520 --> 00:45:57.280
I wonder
how Jane's doing at the beach.

00:45:58.460 --> 00:46:00.200
You should call her, then.

00:46:00.240 --> 00:46:01.640
Junior, give her a call.

00:46:01.680 --> 00:46:02.400
Okay.

00:46:14.520 --> 00:46:15.600
Hi Mom.

00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:17.960
How are you doing? Is the room okay?

00:46:18.200 --> 00:46:19.620
Who's your roommate?

00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:22.120
The room's great, Mom.

00:46:22.440 --> 00:46:23.720
My roommate is Dear,

00:46:23.760 --> 00:46:25.440
the Queen of Architecture
I told you about.

00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:29.960
Is your room close to the beach?

00:46:32.780 --> 00:46:35.520
Yes, Mom. It's right by the beach.

00:46:42.560 --> 00:46:43.480
JaneWill!

00:46:43.520 --> 00:46:44.280
I've gotta go, Mom.

00:46:44.320 --> 00:46:45.370
- JaneWill!
- They need me.

00:46:47.560 --> 00:46:48.560
What is it?

00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:50.600
- Let's go.
- Come on.

00:46:59.520 --> 00:47:00.450
Hey,

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:02.320
did you already get a job?

00:47:04.080 --> 00:47:05.800
Why are you dressed
like a flight attendant?

00:47:05.840 --> 00:47:07.240
Are you working for an airline?

00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:09.160
I am.

00:47:10.720 --> 00:47:12.000
No way.

00:47:12.200 --> 00:47:15.080
Airlines only hire women.

00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:18.240
They'd never hire you.

00:47:18.360 --> 00:47:19.240
Look,

00:47:19.740 --> 00:47:21.120
where I work

00:47:21.560 --> 00:47:22.880
has nothing to do with you.

00:47:23.080 --> 00:47:24.000
- Jane...
- Mom!

00:47:24.580 --> 00:47:25.960
So you're calling me nosy?!

00:47:27.280 --> 00:47:30.040
You're a pervert,
and now you're talking back?

00:47:34.840 --> 00:47:36.120
You should go to work, sweetie.

00:47:39.240 --> 00:47:40.600
Goodbye.

00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:43.520
How did you raise your kid

00:47:43.560 --> 00:47:45.040
to be so disrespectful?!

00:47:45.840 --> 00:47:48.680
Probably the way
your mom raised you.

00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:51.520
And just so you know,

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:54.240
if you don't leave my daughter alone,

00:47:55.200 --> 00:47:57.360
I'll sue you for defamation.

00:47:57.800 --> 00:48:00.680
Section 393 states what, Jimmy?

00:48:01.160 --> 00:48:03.960
Whoever insults or verbally humiliates
another person,

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:05.520
causing shame or hatred,

00:48:05.560 --> 00:48:07.200
shall be imprisoned
for no more than one month

00:48:07.240 --> 00:48:08.640
or fined for no more than
ten thousand baht,

00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:10.360
or both, ma'am.

00:48:12.560 --> 00:48:14.520
If you wish to speak, do so.

00:48:15.060 --> 00:48:16.080
Junior, record a video.

00:48:16.120 --> 00:48:16.760
Okay.

00:48:26.960 --> 00:48:27.840
Easy, Mom.

00:48:27.880 --> 00:48:28.720
Let's go inside.

00:48:29.600 --> 00:48:36.380
♫Every time you are near,
I feel at ease♫

00:48:44.940 --> 00:48:46.740
You don't like my guts either, do you?

00:48:47.280 --> 00:48:50.000
I heard she has a love rival right now.

00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:51.840
Milk helps with spice, you know.

00:48:55.920 --> 00:48:58.000
The thing you're curious about,

00:48:58.280 --> 00:48:59.960
why don't you just ask Dai yourself?
