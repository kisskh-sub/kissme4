[To My Shore]

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:32.800
Mr. Shi, let's have a drink.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.919
The star of the night is sitting over there.

00:02:34.919 --> 00:02:36.279
Why pester me to drink with you?

00:02:36.279 --> 00:02:38.199
- Drink with him.
- We already did.

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:41.629
He gave us a smile and sent us back.

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:51.960
What's wrong, Xiao?

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.279
These are handpicked from all over Thailand.

00:02:54.279 --> 00:02:56.080
Top tier eye candy.

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.839
Men, women, boys, girls,
and everything in between.

00:02:58.839 --> 00:03:01.960
All specially chosen
to celebrate your birthday.

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:03.460
Don't like them?

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:05.559
I do.

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:07.399
You went all out, Mr. Shi.

00:03:07.399 --> 00:03:08.600
You do?

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:14.007
Then why have your eyes never left
dear Director You all night?

00:03:14.679 --> 00:03:15.800
If I didn't know the back story,

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.860
I'd think you'd fallen for him.

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:23.399
Anyway, he's also my gift to you.

00:03:23.399 --> 00:03:24.600
Well?

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:25.960
Do you like it?

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:27.259
Not bad.

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:30.759
I know you've switched teams,

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:32.919
so I gave you more choices.

00:03:32.919 --> 00:03:34.320
The sea's big with plenty of fish.

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.740
Time to change flavors, don't you think?

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.600
Hey, you.

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.539
Bring me another fresh batch.

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.380
Mr. Shi, here they are.

00:03:49.559 --> 00:03:53.479
Happy birthday, President Fan!

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:54.580
Excuse me.

00:03:58.839 --> 00:04:00.979
You're in quite the mood tonight.

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.720
They're just clowning around.

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.139
Here, have a drink.

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:09.199
Anyone catch your eye?

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:11.880
The quality's pretty good.

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.380
They are pretty good.

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.880
You're the birthday boy,

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:18.920
so you pick first.

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:21.339
After you pick, I'll help you
test-drive the rest.

00:04:22.959 --> 00:04:25.579
And how do you plan to do that, Director You?

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.160
You don't even know how to do that?

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:33.100
Then I'd better give you a good lesson tonight.

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.519
You. Come here.

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:49.200
What would you like to drink, sir?

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.700
- I'll choose for you.
- Pick whatever you like.

00:05:04.279 --> 00:05:05.380
Here.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:07.980
Let me feed you.

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:13.040
Mr. You.

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:14.679
That's it?

00:05:14.679 --> 00:05:17.100
No secret techniques from the vault?

00:05:21.559 --> 00:05:22.859
Handsome.

00:05:23.839 --> 00:05:25.140
You're up.

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:29.600
Then I'm adding ice, okay?

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:32.619
You might feel a little cold.

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:56.619
Since you're willing to teach me,

00:05:57.239 --> 00:05:59.739
let's switch to a better classroom.

00:06:02.239 --> 00:06:03.660
Sure.

00:06:10.959 --> 00:06:12.959
If you want to learn,

00:06:12.959 --> 00:06:15.000
make sure you do as I tell you.

00:06:21.239 --> 00:06:23.380
How are you going to teach me?

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.640
What?

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:30.119
Are you jealous?

00:06:30.119 --> 00:06:33.779
I know every emotion... except jealously.

00:06:34.399 --> 00:06:35.760
Right.

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:39.499
Our dear President Fan never gets jealous.

00:06:41.839 --> 00:06:44.878
Happy birthday, babe.

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:50.260
Then teach me how to be happy.

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:57.420
Did you master what I just showed you?

00:06:59.519 --> 00:07:00.820
Come here.

00:07:13.679 --> 00:07:16.559
What would you like to drink, sir?

00:07:16.559 --> 00:07:18.000
Shu Lang.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.299
Yeah?

00:07:20.079 --> 00:07:22.140
Any requests?

00:07:25.119 --> 00:07:27.019
I'll go along with whatever you like.

00:07:54.519 --> 00:07:56.779
Your mixing is a little off.

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:10.540
It's too light.

00:08:11.519 --> 00:08:13.119
You need a penalty.

00:08:13.119 --> 00:08:14.980
How do you want to punish me?

00:08:25.799 --> 00:08:27.040
Fan Xiao.

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:29.480
Your fiancée is here.

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:31.720
Don't stop, Mr. You.

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:33.979
Your fiancée!

00:08:37.719 --> 00:08:40.380
- Fan Xiao!
- I don't have a fiancée.

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:44.984
Do you want me to make myself scarce?

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:48.400
No. Let's go.

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:50.059
We'll go take a look together.

00:08:51.919 --> 00:08:53.219
Wait.

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:05.799
This is your birthday gift. It's not expensive.

00:09:05.799 --> 00:09:07.000
.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.340
Don't mind it.

00:09:19.559 --> 00:09:24.400
I hope you'll be happy
every single moment of your life.

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:26.320
With you around, I'll always be happy.

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:28.580
x

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:31.479
I love it. I'll wear it all the time.

00:09:31.479 --> 00:09:32.880
x

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:34.520
Maybe not all the time, or your luxury watches will complain.

00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:37.640
x

00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:40.260
Let's go. Time to meet your fiancée.

00:09:44.559 --> 00:09:46.400
I don't have a fiancée. Don't believe anything they say.

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:48.380
x

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:53.780
Okay.

00:09:57.330 --> 00:10:01.069
[Episode 7]

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:04.479
Big brother, second brother. Xiao's here.

00:10:04.479 --> 00:10:07.500
See? Bathroom breaks don't take that long.

00:10:14.239 --> 00:10:16.080
Third Bro.

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:17.239
You've been gone seven or eight months, and never came back to visit us.

00:10:17.239 --> 00:10:19.526
.

00:10:19.526 --> 00:10:20.545
Since you wouldn't come back, we bought tickets and flew over

00:10:20.545 --> 00:10:22.390
x

00:10:22.390 --> 00:10:24.479
to celebrate your birthday.

00:10:24.479 --> 00:10:26.739
Big Bro, second Bro.

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:30.000
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.400
I would've picked you up at the airport.

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:33.200
We wanted to surprise you.

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:35.679
So, we had Uncle Xu pick us up.

00:10:35.679 --> 00:10:37.000
You boys are grown men, and still play these games.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.039
x

00:10:39.039 --> 00:10:41.280
But seeing you close and affectionate, makes me happy for the old chairman.

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:43.799
x

00:10:43.799 --> 00:10:46.760
Xiao Xiao, it's your birthday today.

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:50.000
Ting Ting insisted on coming to celebrate
as soon as she was discharged.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.219
She took ages choosing your gift.

00:10:59.559 --> 00:11:04.039
Brother Xiao Xiao, thank you for
taking me to Bangkok for treatment.

00:11:04.039 --> 00:11:06.380
This is the present I chose for you.

00:11:08.359 --> 00:11:09.700
You're too kind.

00:11:11.239 --> 00:11:12.479
- Huo.
- Here.

00:11:12.479 --> 00:11:13.479
x

00:11:22.719 --> 00:11:25.080
Xiao Xiao.

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:28.679
Aren't you going to open Ting Ting's gift?

00:11:28.679 --> 00:11:31.479
She said you often visited her in the hospital.

00:11:31.479 --> 00:11:32.960
She's always been thinking about you.

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:37.059
She put a lot of heart into choosing it.

00:11:39.559 --> 00:11:40.799
Shu Lang. Sit here.

00:11:40.799 --> 00:11:42.460
x

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:53.559
Uncle Xu. Ting Ting is like my little sister.

00:11:53.559 --> 00:11:55.880
x

00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:57.559
Taking care of her is my duty.

00:11:57.559 --> 00:11:59.039
As for the gifts, there are too many of them.

00:11:59.039 --> 00:12:00.599
x

00:12:00.599 --> 00:12:02.380
Let me go through them at home.

00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:09.320
- Look at this.
- Father sent us to check on your investments.

00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:15.119
x

00:12:15.119 --> 00:12:17.359
You haven't returned to Shi city for so long.

00:12:17.359 --> 00:12:21.919
Have you lost so much
you can't afford a flight?

00:12:21.919 --> 00:12:23.437
Big Bro's just scaring you.

00:12:23.437 --> 00:12:25.359
Father only asked us to check in on you.

00:12:25.359 --> 00:12:28.080
If there's business trouble, let us help.

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:30.400
You know I'm useless at work, but I can help you chase girls!

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:32.780
x

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:39.500
This should be to your taste, Shu Lang.

00:12:41.119 --> 00:12:42.780
And who might this be?

00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:45.080
Second Bro, this is...

00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:47.200
Director You.

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:49.479
- Right, right.
- I haven't introduced them to you.

00:12:49.479 --> 00:12:50.840
This is my eldest brother, Fan Bo. This is my second brother, Fan Yu.

00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:52.880
x

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:55.479
You should know Vice President Xu, and his daughter Xu Ting.

00:12:55.479 --> 00:12:58.799
x

00:12:58.799 --> 00:13:01.119
Big Bro, Second Bro.

00:13:01.119 --> 00:13:04.200
This is You Shu Lang,
Office Director of Bohai Pharma.

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:06.159
The drug we developed with Bohai is about to hit the market.

00:13:06.159 --> 00:13:07.799
x

00:13:07.799 --> 00:13:09.760
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Same here.

00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:12.200
Since he's your friend, let's...

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:13.880
Fan Xiao.

00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:16.799
Xu Ting is your fiancée. Reflect on how you treated her.

00:13:16.799 --> 00:13:18.320
x

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:22.239
Do you even respect Father's
years of friendship with Uncle Xu?

00:13:22.239 --> 00:13:24.960
Big Bro, I don't follow.

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:27.500
Since when did Ting Ting become my fiancée?

00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:30.640
She's a proper young lady.

00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:34.219
If you say that, you'll make her cry.

00:13:34.919 --> 00:13:36.679
Third Bro, have you forgotten?

00:13:36.679 --> 00:13:38.000
Before you left home,

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.840
Father said if Ting Ting recovered, you two would get engaged.

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:41.200
x

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:43.159
If you hadn't agreed, would he have let you come back?

00:13:43.159 --> 00:13:44.780
x

00:13:46.719 --> 00:13:50.000
Director You, how about we go play cards?

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:51.700
- Let's go.
- Don't go.

00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:55.960
I only remember Father saying

00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:57.799
if Miss Xu and I got along, we could consider an engagement.

00:13:57.799 --> 00:13:59.119
x

00:13:59.119 --> 00:14:00.679
Ting Ting is excellent. I treat her like family.

00:14:00.679 --> 00:14:03.179
x

00:14:04.039 --> 00:14:05.400
Speaking of which, I've nearly forgotten all of
my casual chats with Father.

00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:09.799
x

00:14:09.799 --> 00:14:13.159
Why do you two remember even clearer than I do?

00:14:13.159 --> 00:14:15.919
I remember matters of love very well.

00:14:15.919 --> 00:14:18.599
I'm not like Big Bro
who only remembers serious affairs.

00:14:18.599 --> 00:14:19.880
Fan Xiao.

00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:24.080
You know perfectly well what Father meant.

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:29.380
You think playing dumb
will delay this indefinitely?

00:14:31.359 --> 00:14:33.239
If you don't want delays, you can take the fall.

00:14:33.239 --> 00:14:35.679
x

00:14:35.679 --> 00:14:37.559
Didn't Sister-in-law already run off? No one will oppose.

00:14:37.559 --> 00:14:39.640
x

00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:41.239
Fan Xiao. Don't push it.

00:14:41.239 --> 00:14:42.479
Big Bro... Fan Xiao, watch your mouth.

00:14:42.479 --> 00:14:44.520
x

00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:46.719
You know Sister-in-law is Big Bro's sore spot.

00:14:46.719 --> 00:14:50.000
Wh-Why bring up what hurts?

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.299
You...

00:14:53.799 --> 00:14:56.880
- Ting Ting.
- That's not what they meant.

00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:58.799
Ting Ting! Ting Ting!

00:14:58.799 --> 00:15:02.239
My daughter is not a toy
for the Fan family to bully.

00:15:02.239 --> 00:15:04.080
Uncle Xu! Uncle Xu!

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:05.320
Don't go! Uncle Xu!

00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:06.380
Well...

00:15:12.719 --> 00:15:13.760
Third Bro. Xu Zhong loves fanning flames
in front of Father.

00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:17.000
x

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.119
Who knows what charge he'll pin on you?

00:15:20.119 --> 00:15:22.760
You might as well get engaged to Xu Ting first to appease Father.

00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:24.520
x

00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:27.039
As time passes, you can go with the flow and rethink things later.

00:15:27.039 --> 00:15:29.679
x

00:15:29.679 --> 00:15:32.080
Big Bro, Third Bro is the youngest. He's prone to making mistakes.

00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:33.400
x

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:35.559
I'm sure he didn't mean to bring up your divorce just to rile you.

00:15:35.559 --> 00:15:38.559
x

00:15:38.559 --> 00:15:40.479
Today is his birthday.

00:15:40.479 --> 00:15:42.479
Let it slide this once.

00:15:42.479 --> 00:15:44.979
Let's have a proper drink as brothers.

00:15:45.919 --> 00:15:47.799
If we're drinking, let's switch to big glasses.

00:15:47.799 --> 00:15:49.460
x

00:15:50.239 --> 00:15:53.080
Your big brother can really drink.

00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:55.619
Was he a wine barrel in a past life?

00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:00.239
You're definitely tipsy.

00:16:00.239 --> 00:16:03.059
You're even cracking dad jokes.

00:16:04.159 --> 00:16:06.580
The room's spinning.

00:16:07.359 --> 00:16:08.859
Let me lean on you for a second.

00:16:09.919 --> 00:16:12.679
- Director You.
- Yeah?

00:16:12.679 --> 00:16:14.859
What are we, exactly?

00:16:15.599 --> 00:16:17.760
Why did you throw yourself
in front of the bottle for me?

00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:20.479
When he said that to you, your face went white.

00:16:20.479 --> 00:16:23.200
x

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:25.559
With your tolerance, you were already over the limit.

00:16:25.559 --> 00:16:27.599
x

00:16:27.599 --> 00:16:30.039
If I hadn't taken over, you'd have drunk yourself under the table.

00:16:30.039 --> 00:16:32.520
x

00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:35.983
And your brothers wouldn't have
to work so hard to take you down.

00:16:36.719 --> 00:16:38.020
Here.

00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:41.159
Drink.

00:16:41.159 --> 00:16:43.359
That's more like it, Third Bro.

00:16:43.359 --> 00:16:45.359
Drink more with Big Bro.

00:16:45.359 --> 00:16:46.359
Here. Drink.

00:16:46.359 --> 00:16:47.719
x

00:16:47.719 --> 00:16:49.099
Big Bro, here.

00:16:51.479 --> 00:16:53.719
I'll drink this for President Fan.

00:16:53.719 --> 00:16:56.479
What gives you the right to drink in his place?

00:16:56.479 --> 00:16:58.919
He has an important meeting with us tomorrow.

00:16:58.919 --> 00:17:00.640
He shouldn't get hammered tonight.

00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:03.239
To ensure the project reaches
mass production and profitability quickly,

00:17:03.239 --> 00:17:06.040
let me handle the rest of the drinks.

00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:09.739
And let me take the chance
to welcome you both back.

00:17:11.359 --> 00:17:12.560
Fair point. All right. Drink your fill.

00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:14.680
x

00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:16.180
- Come on.
- Cheers.

00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:22.920
I'm honored to host both presidents here. Bottoms up.

00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:24.459
x

00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:27.199
Your big brother hates you openly, but your second brother's malice

00:17:27.199 --> 00:17:30.000
x

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.219
is far worse.

00:17:35.359 --> 00:17:37.180
Sharp eyes, Director You.

00:17:38.239 --> 00:17:40.500
You saw through that.

00:17:49.959 --> 00:17:52.359
My big brother hates me to my face.

00:17:52.359 --> 00:17:56.060
Fan Yu hates me from every dark corner.

00:17:57.599 --> 00:18:00.599
Like hands in the shadows,

00:18:00.599 --> 00:18:05.060
he's waiting to drag me down.

00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:10.199
Honestly, I envy folks like my big bro.

00:18:10.199 --> 00:18:11.400
He's straightforward in temper. Love and hate are all out on the table.

00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:16.099
Love and hate are all out on the table.

00:18:17.719 --> 00:18:19.859
Unlike us.

00:18:26.479 --> 00:18:27.780
Us...

00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:30.359
Me and Fan Yu.

00:18:30.359 --> 00:18:32.880
We're the same.

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:36.739
Our true thoughts are buried deep.

00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:38.920
Fake as hell.

00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:41.260
Are we fake too?

00:18:42.599 --> 00:18:44.420
With you, it's all real.

00:18:45.199 --> 00:18:47.640
Couldn't be more real.

00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:49.560
Damn you, Zhang Chi! Hey!

00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:50.719
Touch me again

00:18:50.719 --> 00:18:52.560
and I'll kill your whole family!

00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:54.119
You sick freak, Zhang Chi!

00:18:54.119 --> 00:18:55.160
If I don't castrate you,

00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:57.800
I'm not Xue Bao Tian!

00:18:57.800 --> 00:18:59.599
- Xue Bao Tian.
- Don't touch me!

00:18:59.599 --> 00:19:01.800
Back off, I'm warning you!

00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:05.219
After we beat him up last time,

00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:07.760
someone scooped him up.

00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:10.619
They've been tangled for a while.

00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:13.599
- Bro! Spare me!
- Could it be that guy?

00:19:13.599 --> 00:19:14.859
Don't move!

00:19:17.479 --> 00:19:20.020
Zhang Chi, put me down!

00:19:21.199 --> 00:19:23.085
Fan Xiao! Fan Xiao!

00:19:23.085 --> 00:19:27.880
Director You! He's going to harvest my kidney!

00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:29.040
Put me down!

00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:31.319
Should we help?

00:19:31.319 --> 00:19:32.680
I'm drunk.

00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:35.000
I'm not getting into a lovers' spat.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:36.979
I'm drunk, too.

00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:48.959
Director.

00:19:48.959 --> 00:19:52.160
Do you think we offended Mr. Xue
of Ruixiang Pharmacies somehow?

00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:54.239
They're stirring trouble again.

00:19:54.239 --> 00:19:57.199
They're pulling all our
near-expiry stock and returning them.

00:19:57.199 --> 00:19:59.800
Usually, items within three months
can't be stocked.

00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:02.199
But they are returning ones
with six months left.

00:20:02.199 --> 00:20:03.977
The ones we're promoting.

00:20:03.977 --> 00:20:07.119
Sales says that the pull order

00:20:07.119 --> 00:20:09.040
was personally given by Young Mr. Xue.

00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:10.479
They told us to ask you for the reason.

00:20:10.479 --> 00:20:15.000
Director Liu is also waiting for instructions.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:16.479
I'll handle it.

00:20:16.479 --> 00:20:19.000
Send me the pull list

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.219
and details on the related products now.

00:20:26.119 --> 00:20:27.880
Hello.

00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:29.239
I'm beat.

00:20:29.239 --> 00:20:30.839
Fan Yu's acting CFO now,

00:20:30.839 --> 00:20:32.560
but he never does real work.

00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:35.219
As soon as we're off,
he calls meetings to review the books.

00:20:36.119 --> 00:20:38.920
I'm running out of patience to play nice.

00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:41.060
Working late again today?

00:20:42.079 --> 00:20:43.280
Just wrapped up.

00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:45.479
Maybe they saw my glum face

00:20:45.479 --> 00:20:47.219
and adjourned early.

00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:49.800
You don't need to come to my place tonight.

00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:51.719
I refuse. Don't say it.

00:20:51.719 --> 00:20:53.479
I won't agree.

00:20:53.479 --> 00:20:55.760
These days, only when I see you

00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:59.479
and hold you do I feel alive.

00:20:59.479 --> 00:21:03.319
I'm trying to tell you,
I'm at your place now.

00:21:03.319 --> 00:21:04.760
What?

00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:05.779
You're at my place?

00:21:05.779 --> 00:21:07.040
You work late every day

00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:08.719
and still drive across half the city to mine.

00:21:08.719 --> 00:21:10.920
It's too much hassle,
so I came to yours instead.

00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:12.760
It's closer to your office.

00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:14.800
Saves you time in the morning and night.

00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:17.180
So, I get to see you right away?

00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:19.560
Drive safe.

00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:21.560
I still have some work to handle.

00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:23.339
Okay. See you soon.

00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:48.599
I need to handle Xue Bao Tian

00:21:48.599 --> 00:21:51.079
before Fan Xiao gets back,

00:21:51.079 --> 00:21:54.219
so he doesn't get distracted and interfere.

00:21:54.839 --> 00:21:58.256
Those two brothers already
give him enough grief.

00:22:05.408 --> 00:22:07.796
[You Shu Lang]

00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:12.760
He's probably driving.

00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:14.300
I'll leave a message.

00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:28.420
So many missed calls
and messages from Shu Lang.

00:22:40.599 --> 00:22:43.719
Fan Xiao, I just called you to say

00:22:43.719 --> 00:22:46.705
I'll check my email on your computer briefly.

00:22:46.705 --> 00:22:48.880
Fuck, my computer.

00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:50.540
You didn't even set a password.

00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:25.180
Shu Lang.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:27.640
It's so dark in here.

00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:29.699
Why not draw the curtains?

00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:37.180
You'd better not touch me.

00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:41.739
What's wrong? Why are you so mad?

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:44.359
Did I mess up?

00:23:44.359 --> 00:23:46.040
Fan Xiao.

00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:48.239
Don't play dumb.

00:23:48.239 --> 00:23:50.239
I'll give you one chance.

00:23:50.239 --> 00:23:52.319
He must've found out.

00:23:52.319 --> 00:23:54.359
He always means what he says.

00:23:54.359 --> 00:23:57.400
You know I always mean what I say.

00:23:57.400 --> 00:24:00.560
Lying now will only make it worse.

00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:03.319
You know the cost of lying.

00:24:03.319 --> 00:24:05.760
It's better to tell the truth.

00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:09.420
It shouldn't be that serious.

00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:14.553
You saw that dashcam clip?

00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:19.760
I found it while sorting files.

00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:20.839
I didn't have the heart to delete it.

00:24:20.839 --> 00:24:23.160
When I miss you and you're not around,

00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:25.060
I take a look.

00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:27.590
If you don't like it,

00:24:27.590 --> 00:24:29.560
I'll delete it.

00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:31.119
Forgive me.

00:24:31.119 --> 00:24:32.420
Director You.

00:24:33.719 --> 00:24:35.019
Fan Xiao.

00:24:35.019 --> 00:24:36.520
Then tell me this.

00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:39.479
When did you find that video?

00:24:39.479 --> 00:24:40.760
Recently.

00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:42.219
Not too long ago.

00:24:43.199 --> 00:24:45.239
After we got together?

00:24:45.239 --> 00:24:46.540
Probably.

00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:52.920
Fan Xiao, I checked the playback log.

00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:54.959
After it was uploaded to your terminal,

00:24:54.959 --> 00:24:56.880
it was played frequently.

00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:58.000
The earliest replay

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.699
was two hours after it was recorded.

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:04.800
Explain this.

00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:08.800
Why did you open that log
every night from that day on?

00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:11.479
Don't give me crap about liking me since then.

00:25:11.479 --> 00:25:14.020
Save that bullshit.

00:25:14.719 --> 00:25:16.780
Even if you don't let me say it, I have to.

00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:21.239
I stumbled on that clip by accident.

00:25:21.239 --> 00:25:23.479
At first I just took a glance,

00:25:23.479 --> 00:25:25.680
but I couldn't stop.

00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:27.560
It was like a magnet,

00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:29.979
drawing me in every minute.

00:25:32.119 --> 00:25:34.380
Each time, it sparked endless desire.

00:25:34.380 --> 00:25:37.020
I despised myself for it.

00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:39.319
You were my best friend.

00:25:39.319 --> 00:25:42.300
How could I secretly
lust after my friend endlessly?

00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:45.160
For a while,

00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:46.780
I didn't dare meet you.

00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:51.119
When I did, I couldn't meet your eyes.

00:25:51.119 --> 00:25:52.680
It felt like a desecration.

00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:56.520
But every time I decided to delete it,

00:25:56.520 --> 00:25:58.760
I hesitated.

00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:02.339
I even restored it from the trash many times.

00:26:04.119 --> 00:26:07.099
I can't explain why I did that.

00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:12.280
I don't know why only you
could spark that feeling.

00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:13.979
Looking back...

00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:17.839
I'd already fallen for you.

00:26:17.839 --> 00:26:19.199
Fan Xiao.

00:26:19.199 --> 00:26:21.479
We'd known each other one month.

00:26:21.479 --> 00:26:23.160
Where would love come from?

00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:26.479
Besides, weren't you straight then?

00:26:26.479 --> 00:26:28.760
There's no way one video bent you.

00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:31.280
Who wrote the rules?

00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:34.040
Who says you can't fall for someone
within a month?

00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:36.060
If I'd been that straight,

00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:39.839
how would I be in your bed now?

00:26:39.839 --> 00:26:41.140
Director You.

00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:45.273
Your video ruined a straight man.

00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:48.380
Shouldn't you take responsibility?

00:26:49.719 --> 00:26:51.099
Nonsense.

00:26:51.959 --> 00:26:53.119
Fan Xiao.

00:26:53.119 --> 00:26:56.119
I never saw you dodge my gaze,

00:26:56.119 --> 00:26:59.160
or feel your helplessness or guilt.

00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:02.119
Don't make yourself look good with these lines.

00:27:02.119 --> 00:27:04.619
You're a pervert.

00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:10.380
If you say I am, then I am.

00:27:11.359 --> 00:27:13.880
I know I was wrong.

00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:18.560
I just watched my boyfriend's R-rated video
ahead of time, that's all.

00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:21.319
Just a bit sooner.

00:27:21.319 --> 00:27:24.359
It's hardly a capital offense, Director You.

00:27:24.359 --> 00:27:26.719
I knew he'd be shameless,

00:27:26.719 --> 00:27:28.420
wheedling and whining.

00:27:35.319 --> 00:27:37.400
You only watched mine?

00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:38.680
You've never recorded anyone else?

00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:40.280
Only yours.

00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:41.640
Can I believe you?

00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:43.459
I'm not lying about this.

00:27:44.359 --> 00:27:45.699
"About this," huh?

00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:50.640
I haven't forgiven you yet.

00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:53.260
Then what do you want, Director You?

00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:57.979
The video was exciting, right?

00:27:58.599 --> 00:28:00.380
Record one for me, too.

00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:14.839
Start.

00:28:14.839 --> 00:28:16.719
Everything off?

00:28:16.719 --> 00:28:18.560
All of it.

00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:20.900
So, you have such kinks.

00:28:44.719 --> 00:28:46.062
Stop.

00:28:52.199 --> 00:28:54.180
Where are you looking, Director You?

00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:56.619
Seems like...

00:28:57.839 --> 00:29:00.060
you're more interested in my hands.

00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:02.500
Do you want it...

00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:06.160
on me...

00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:09.819
Or on you?

00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:11.900
Fan Xiao.

00:29:13.119 --> 00:29:14.520
If you behave,

00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:16.900
you'll be the only one in my dreams.

00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:24.319
Yes.

00:29:24.319 --> 00:29:26.260
I'm right by your car.

00:29:28.119 --> 00:29:29.979
Here.

00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:33.079
Director You.

00:29:33.079 --> 00:29:35.319
Not glued to Fan Xiao today?

00:29:35.319 --> 00:29:36.680
What do you want with me?

00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:39.760
I came to apologize to you, Mr. Xue.

00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:41.640
Hey, take it back.

00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:43.260
I can't afford that...

00:29:46.079 --> 00:29:47.631
Say, Mr. You.

00:29:47.631 --> 00:29:50.599
You moved mountains
to rescue a hostess, and yet...

00:29:50.599 --> 00:29:53.880
When it's me, you close your eyes
and let me die?

00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:56.540
Isn't my fortune worth it?

00:29:57.880 --> 00:29:59.479
A hostess?

00:29:59.479 --> 00:30:00.979
What hostess?

00:30:07.479 --> 00:30:09.660
Fan Xiao slept with you, didn't he?

00:30:12.479 --> 00:30:14.640
Nailed it?

00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:16.760
No wonder he's changed.

00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:18.520
He clings to you like
a Bodhisattva on an altar.

00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:21.020
Kept and worshipped.

00:30:22.959 --> 00:30:26.699
Someone like you can get topped?

00:30:28.338 --> 00:30:30.414
Guess it's not that I'm bad with women.

00:30:30.414 --> 00:30:31.880
Fucking hell.

00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:35.400
Since that bastard Zhang Chi did me,

00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:38.119
I can't even flirt right.

00:30:38.119 --> 00:30:39.479
Director You.

00:30:39.479 --> 00:30:43.060
Do you have similar problems?

00:30:46.280 --> 00:30:48.219
What do you need today?

00:30:49.199 --> 00:30:52.000
The Bohai meds thing, right?

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:55.040
Yes, I wanted to ask about those returns.

00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:57.400
How should we handle them?

00:30:57.400 --> 00:30:58.560
It's nothing.

00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:00.359
Just going through the motions.

00:31:00.359 --> 00:31:02.280
From now on, stock them if needed,

00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:03.839
promote them if needed.

00:31:03.839 --> 00:31:06.020
If anything comes up, come straight to me.

00:31:09.653 --> 00:31:10.680
Okay.

00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:13.760
Thank you for cutting us some slack.

00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:15.199
It's nothing.

00:31:15.199 --> 00:31:18.319
From today, we're brothers in misery.

00:31:18.319 --> 00:31:19.239
We're on the same boat.

00:31:19.239 --> 00:31:20.479
And listen.

00:31:20.479 --> 00:31:22.800
About Fan Xiao...

00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:24.540
Let me think how to say this...

00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:28.839
Money, cars, housing... Ask for what you want.

00:31:28.839 --> 00:31:31.140
He's loaded anyway.

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:35.060
Hello?

00:31:35.839 --> 00:31:36.920
Why rush me?

00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:38.400
I just stepped out.

00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:40.079
Okay, okay. Got it, got it.

00:31:40.079 --> 00:31:41.380
I'm heading back now.

00:31:42.599 --> 00:31:44.359
- Mr. Xue.
- Yeah?

00:31:44.359 --> 00:31:46.864
You mentioned a hostess.

00:31:46.864 --> 00:31:48.987
I rescued a hostess?

00:31:50.119 --> 00:31:51.400
What hostess?

00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:52.400
You misheard.

00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:53.724
I'm off.

00:31:53.724 --> 00:31:56.466
That bastard Zhang Chi...

00:31:58.139 --> 00:32:01.479
Anyway, keep your eyes open.

00:32:01.479 --> 00:32:03.319
I'm off.

00:32:03.319 --> 00:32:04.619
Bye.

00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:11.339
A hostess...

00:32:13.319 --> 00:32:16.479
Sir, we've got all types of girls.

00:32:16.479 --> 00:32:18.979
What's your preference?

00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:23.979
One moment.

00:32:25.079 --> 00:32:26.839
Hello.

00:32:26.839 --> 00:32:28.479
I have to work late today.

00:32:28.479 --> 00:32:30.040
I'll be back late.

00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:33.961
Looks all upright and clean, like a decent guy.

00:32:34.814 --> 00:32:37.528
Men are all the same.

00:32:37.528 --> 00:32:40.359
Lying through their teeth to sneak around.

00:32:40.359 --> 00:32:43.079
Eat first, don't wait up.

00:32:43.079 --> 00:32:44.380
Okay.

00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:47.920
What type do you like?

00:32:47.920 --> 00:32:49.640
I'll bring them in for you to choose.

00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:53.079
Fresh-faced, like a recent college grad.

00:32:53.079 --> 00:32:54.760
Bring that type.

00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:56.619
Sure, one moment.

00:32:59.959 --> 00:33:01.000
Ladies, come with me.

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:02.540
Come in.

00:33:11.119 --> 00:33:13.719
Greet the gentleman.

00:33:13.719 --> 00:33:16.239
Good evening, sir.

00:33:16.239 --> 00:33:20.319
Mr. You, pick whoever you like.

00:33:20.319 --> 00:33:21.776
- This one stays.
- Okay.

00:33:21.776 --> 00:33:23.199
The rest can go.

00:33:23.199 --> 00:33:25.578
Enjoy your night.

00:33:25.578 --> 00:33:27.300
Come on.

00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:35.280
Tang Xiao Wan.

00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:37.459
That was the name you used, right?

00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:39.719
I remember you.

00:33:39.719 --> 00:33:42.400
You're one of the few good people I've met.

00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:44.479
I thought you were stupid then.

00:33:44.479 --> 00:33:47.540
Was it worth it for a complete stranger?

00:33:52.119 --> 00:33:53.619
I do what I can.

00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:56.560
If I can help, I will.

00:33:56.560 --> 00:33:58.760
If I really can't,

00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:00.619
I won't force it.

00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:07.160
You came with questions, didn't you?

00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:08.459
Yes.

00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:13.560
Who was toying with me that night?

00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:15.959
You only realized now
they were playing you?

00:34:15.959 --> 00:34:18.080
You're so dumb.

00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:19.600
You should know...

00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:22.280
we keep our mouths shut in this line of work.

00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:24.320
If we don't, there goes our job.

00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:25.959
I know.

00:34:25.959 --> 00:34:27.300
I understand.

00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:30.927
I don't know how much

00:34:30.927 --> 00:34:33.520
it would take for you to share what you know.

00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:36.179
You still look down on us, huh?

00:34:41.159 --> 00:34:44.179
Buy me a lollipop and I'll tell you.

00:34:45.919 --> 00:34:48.000
You're the only good man

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:50.020
I've met since I started.

00:34:56.659 --> 00:35:00.387
[Fan Xiao]

00:35:07.719 --> 00:35:09.840
- Hello?
- Shu Lang.

00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:11.879
Why aren't you back yet?

00:35:11.879 --> 00:35:14.080
I kept calling, but you didn't answer.

00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:15.479
I'm fine.

00:35:15.479 --> 00:35:17.000
I talked to Xue Bao Tian today

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.239
about stocking near-expiry items.

00:35:19.239 --> 00:35:20.800
He let it slide.

00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:23.199
I handled the follow-up quickly.

00:35:23.199 --> 00:35:25.600
Where are you? I'll pick you up.

00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:27.320
No need.

00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:28.820
I'm heading back.

00:35:30.919 --> 00:35:32.360
Fan Xiao.

00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:34.239
Xue helped a lot this time.

00:35:34.239 --> 00:35:36.020
I should thank him.

00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:40.020
I'm thinking of inviting him out.

00:35:40.719 --> 00:35:42.280
You presence carries weight.

00:35:42.280 --> 00:35:45.000
Call a couple of his friends to join us.

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:48.399
Sure. We'll go with your plan.

00:35:48.399 --> 00:35:50.360
I'm used to sleeping while holding you.

00:35:50.360 --> 00:35:53.399
Without you, I don't feel at ease.

00:35:53.399 --> 00:35:54.699
Okay.

00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:09.840
How did I lose again?

00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:11.639
I never win with you guys.

00:36:11.639 --> 00:36:13.360
Then it's on me.

00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:16.679
I invited you out to cheer you up.

00:36:16.679 --> 00:36:18.639
I'm so happy.

00:36:18.639 --> 00:36:20.399
Super happy.

00:36:20.399 --> 00:36:22.520
As long as I'm not with Zhang Chi,

00:36:22.520 --> 00:36:24.760
I'm extra happy.

00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:27.199
Girls, booze, brothers.

00:36:27.199 --> 00:36:28.919
That's life.

00:36:28.919 --> 00:36:30.879
Mr. Xue.

00:36:30.879 --> 00:36:33.560
Thanks for your continued support
of Bohai Pharma.

00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:34.560
Cheers.

00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:35.860
You're too polite.

00:36:36.578 --> 00:36:39.100
President Fan, join us!

00:36:39.919 --> 00:36:40.959
- Come on.
- Sure, I'll keep you company.

00:36:40.959 --> 00:36:42.120
Bottoms up!

00:36:42.120 --> 00:36:44.294
- Let's drink together.
- Drink up!

00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:51.560
Keep going!

00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:53.811
I don't believe I can't win tonight.

00:36:53.811 --> 00:36:55.419
Keep going!

00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:02.919
Just drinking when you lose is boring.

00:37:02.919 --> 00:37:07.199
Let's raise the stakes.

00:37:07.199 --> 00:37:08.979
Make it exciting.

00:37:10.520 --> 00:37:11.800
Director You.

00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:14.560
You're growing on me.

00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:16.558
Let's play. The wilder the better.

00:37:16.558 --> 00:37:17.860
How do we play?

00:37:18.919 --> 00:37:21.020
President Fan, are you playing?

00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:23.520
If you like it, I'm in.

00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:24.820
Your call.

00:37:34.399 --> 00:37:38.580
One of these glasses has something extra.

00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:42.719
The loser picks one at random.

00:37:42.719 --> 00:37:44.919
What you drink...

00:37:44.919 --> 00:37:46.699
is up to fate.

00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:58.540
Xiao.

00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:07.399
He's joking.

00:38:07.399 --> 00:38:08.479
Don't you know him?

00:38:08.479 --> 00:38:10.600
He's the most law-abiding guy around.

00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:11.600
After drinking,

00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:14.840
he won't even drive in his own courtyard.

00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:16.560
He wouldn't go that far.

00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:17.860
He's teasing you.

00:38:23.639 --> 00:38:26.260
Now's not the time to take Xue down.

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.479
You think I'm taking him down?

00:38:29.479 --> 00:38:30.800
What else?

00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:32.679
He's a jerk,

00:38:32.679 --> 00:38:35.340
but it's not the right time.

00:38:37.399 --> 00:38:40.159
Is he the only jerk?

00:38:40.159 --> 00:38:41.879
None of them are good people.

00:38:41.879 --> 00:38:43.959
They made a clown of you.

00:38:43.959 --> 00:38:45.419
All of them?

00:38:47.199 --> 00:38:50.159
I remember...

00:38:50.159 --> 00:38:53.360
the man with the Buddha pendant.

00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:55.479
He didn't say much,

00:38:55.479 --> 00:38:58.260
but I think he knew.

00:38:59.080 --> 00:39:00.840
You sure?

00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:04.479
Not a hundred percent.

00:39:04.479 --> 00:39:07.879
But a woman's intuition is sharp.

00:39:07.879 --> 00:39:10.280
He didn't actively participate,

00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:13.179
but he's no good.

00:39:20.080 --> 00:39:21.879
Mr. Good Guy.

00:39:21.879 --> 00:39:23.919
You can't touch them.

00:39:23.919 --> 00:39:26.840
They're rich bastards.

00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:28.199
Don't think about revenge.

00:39:28.199 --> 00:39:29.699
Stay away.

00:39:37.239 --> 00:39:38.762
Mr. Xue.

00:39:40.719 --> 00:39:44.560
That female subordinate last time
was fake, right?

00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:46.739
You hired her to mess with me.

00:39:58.280 --> 00:40:02.479
But the spiked drink was real.

00:40:02.479 --> 00:40:05.467
When you watched me down that glass,

00:40:07.239 --> 00:40:08.959
was it fun?

00:40:08.959 --> 00:40:10.919
Was it exciting?

00:40:10.919 --> 00:40:12.459
Shut your mouths.

00:40:17.879 --> 00:40:19.679
Sorry.

00:40:19.679 --> 00:40:22.379
I slipped into Thai in the heat of the moment.

00:40:23.399 --> 00:40:25.479
Mr. Xue.

00:40:25.479 --> 00:40:27.979
Director You still minds what happened.

00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:33.280
Why don't you explain
what was going on that night.

00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:34.919
Clear the air,

00:40:34.919 --> 00:40:36.280
and there'll be no misunderstanding.

00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:37.580
I...

00:40:38.365 --> 00:40:40.239
Fuck this.

00:40:40.239 --> 00:40:42.320
Why are you still here? Grab a bottle.

00:40:42.320 --> 00:40:43.620
Okay.

00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:47.419
Director You.

00:40:48.719 --> 00:40:51.239
I'm the one who messed with you.

00:40:51.239 --> 00:40:53.159
I don't like you.

00:40:53.159 --> 00:40:56.760
I think you're using Fan Xiao.

00:40:56.760 --> 00:40:59.120
And you put on airs.

00:40:59.120 --> 00:41:01.979
You make him worship you.

00:41:06.280 --> 00:41:10.280
That night, Mr. Xue and I were teasing you.

00:41:10.280 --> 00:41:11.479
It was just a joke.

00:41:11.479 --> 00:41:13.479
He meant no harm.

00:41:13.479 --> 00:41:15.020
But I did.

00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:18.620
I still can't stand you.

00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:21.840
Do you know how much
Fan Xiao spent on your brother?

00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:23.560
Isn't that what you're after?

00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:25.500
Shi Li Hua, you've gone too far.

00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:32.399
We're leaving.

00:41:32.399 --> 00:41:34.340
Now's not the time to talk about this.

00:41:57.479 --> 00:41:59.360
Fan Xiao.

00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:03.159
Did you take part in messing with me?

00:42:03.159 --> 00:42:05.560
Why would I mess with you?

00:42:05.560 --> 00:42:07.780
I protected you all night.

00:42:08.520 --> 00:42:10.399
Did you forget?

00:42:10.399 --> 00:42:12.679
Then why are you nervous?

00:42:12.679 --> 00:42:14.139
Nervous?

00:42:15.719 --> 00:42:18.360
I'm just worried you'll fall out with Xue

00:42:18.360 --> 00:42:20.219
and he'll stir up trouble.

00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:22.479
Fan Xiao.

00:42:22.479 --> 00:42:23.820
Do you know...

00:42:25.719 --> 00:42:29.479
this spot behind your ear,

00:42:29.479 --> 00:42:31.959
it twitches uncontrollably

00:42:31.959 --> 00:42:33.639
when you're terrified.

00:42:33.639 --> 00:42:35.959
When you hear waves,

00:42:35.959 --> 00:42:37.719
when you see the sea,

00:42:37.719 --> 00:42:40.060
and in nightmares, it twitches.

00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:43.379
It twitched three times tonight.

00:42:45.320 --> 00:42:48.000
Don't say you're afraid of Xue making trouble.

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:50.280
That level of trouble

00:42:50.280 --> 00:42:52.639
isn't enough to rattle you, is it?

00:42:52.639 --> 00:42:54.139
President Fan.

00:42:55.080 --> 00:42:57.379
Director You, you're judging me based on this?

00:43:02.479 --> 00:43:03.580
Yes.

00:43:04.333 --> 00:43:05.534
I don't have proof,

00:43:05.534 --> 00:43:08.179
but I feel awful.

00:43:15.600 --> 00:43:16.899
Fan Xiao.

00:43:18.199 --> 00:43:20.074
Let's put some distance between us for now.
