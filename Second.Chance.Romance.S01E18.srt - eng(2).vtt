00:23:41.740 --> 00:23:42.500
Feng Rui,

00:23:43.460 --> 00:23:44.740
sounds like

00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:46.580
you're jealous.

00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:48.580
I'm worried about you.

00:23:49.740 --> 00:23:50.420
I'm fine.

00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:51.180
Don't worry.

00:23:51.660 --> 00:23:52.300
Right now,

00:23:52.780 --> 00:23:54.620
we should be worried
about your mom the most.

00:23:58.900 --> 00:23:59.460
Right.

00:24:00.420 --> 00:24:00.900
So,

00:24:01.780 --> 00:24:03.620
have you figured out how to face Le?

00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:07.140
Since I found out

00:24:07.620 --> 00:24:09.020
he is my child,

00:24:09.180 --> 00:24:10.540
I've thought more than once

00:24:12.980 --> 00:24:14.060
about how to tell him

00:24:14.060 --> 00:24:15.180
that I am his mother.

00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:19.420
Do you think he'll accept it?

00:24:21.140 --> 00:24:21.660
I don't know.

00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:24.140
But what's meant to happen will happen.

00:24:25.780 --> 00:24:26.220
We'll

00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:27.540
face this together.

00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:30.740
Should I

00:24:31.020 --> 00:24:31.820
tell him for you?

00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:32.260
No.

00:24:33.580 --> 00:24:34.580
I have to do it myself.

00:24:37.540 --> 00:24:37.980
Okay.

00:24:39.380 --> 00:24:39.780
By the way,

00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:41.660
what's going on with Siting?

00:24:41.660 --> 00:24:42.980
She's been unreachable lately.

00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:44.420
I don't know.

00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:48.220
Oh no,

00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:52.060
my guess was right after all.

00:24:53.220 --> 00:24:53.700
It's fine.

00:24:55.060 --> 00:24:55.620
It's good.

00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:58.460
Put all your energy into your work

00:24:59.180 --> 00:25:00.740
and take your career to the next level.

00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:01.300
Come on,

00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:05.900
let's toast to my return to work.

00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:09.900
Nothing else, right?

00:25:10.380 --> 00:25:10.980
I'm going back to the company.

00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:15.060
So you won't eat? Fine.

00:25:15.060 --> 00:25:15.980
I'll eat it myself.

00:25:18.180 --> 00:25:18.660
It's all mine.

00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:20.700
No one's to celebrate with me.

00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:21.740
I'll celebrate by myself.

00:25:22.180 --> 00:25:23.060
What's so great about that?

00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:25.700
Grandma.

00:25:27.260 --> 00:25:27.620
Grandma.

00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:30.980
What are you thinking about?

00:25:31.820 --> 00:25:33.260
I've been calling you several times.

00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:34.580
Have you?

00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:36.580
Look, almost no apple left to eat.

00:25:54.660 --> 00:25:55.340
You're back.

00:25:55.420 --> 00:25:55.740
Le!

00:25:55.860 --> 00:25:56.340
Dad,

00:25:57.140 --> 00:25:57.780
you're home.

00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:00.060
I bought you some pastries.

00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:03.780
You left without a word

00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:05.140
and came back without one.

00:26:05.580 --> 00:26:06.580
About the comic con you promised,

00:26:06.580 --> 00:26:08.180
I had to go with Mr. Lu.

00:26:09.180 --> 00:26:09.820
Sorry.

00:26:10.060 --> 00:26:11.460
I had an urgent matter to deal with.

00:26:12.540 --> 00:26:13.860
How did it go?

00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:16.060
It's almost done.

00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:19.860
As long as it's sorted out.

00:26:23.460 --> 00:26:23.740
Le,

00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:25.700
stop playing games.

00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:27.300
Do your homework in your room.

00:26:28.060 --> 00:26:28.580
Take the pastries with you.

00:26:28.740 --> 00:26:29.140
Go to your room.

00:26:31.740 --> 00:26:31.940
Here,

00:26:32.260 --> 00:26:32.980
take this apple.

00:26:33.900 --> 00:26:34.220
Hold it tight.

00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:39.220
Finish your homework before you eat.

00:26:40.380 --> 00:26:41.140
The pastries are yours.

00:26:55.060 --> 00:26:55.900
Who did you go with?

00:26:58.340 --> 00:26:59.780
Aren't you going to say anything?

00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:03.940
When will you register
your marriage with Peiyan?

00:27:04.780 --> 00:27:05.820
You missed it last week.

00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:07.380
I checked it.

00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:08.980
Tomorrow is quite suitable.

00:27:08.980 --> 00:27:09.700
Peiyan and I...

00:27:09.700 --> 00:27:10.180
How about...?

00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:11.020
We've broken up.

00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:18.700
What did you just say?

00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:23.460
Thanks to Peiyan's decision,

00:27:24.340 --> 00:27:26.540
I didn't get lost in this mistake.

00:27:26.980 --> 00:27:27.820
It gave me the chance...

00:27:27.820 --> 00:27:29.580
What do you take marriage for?

00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:31.180
A child's game?

00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:46.180
Just because of Tan Siting?

00:27:49.860 --> 00:27:50.820
Marriage

00:27:50.820 --> 00:27:52.580
should not be built upon lies.

00:27:53.340 --> 00:27:54.660
It's been 12 years.

00:27:55.660 --> 00:27:57.940
Twelve years, and you can't move on.

00:27:59.380 --> 00:28:01.100
What spell did she put on you?

00:28:02.540 --> 00:28:04.340
To avoid feeling guilty toward her,

00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:06.940
you hurt someone who loves you more.

00:28:06.980 --> 00:28:08.980
Aren't you guilty toward Yan?

00:28:09.140 --> 00:28:11.020
Allowing this to keep escalating

00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:12.580
will truly hurt her in the end.

00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:14.420
Think about it.

00:28:15.260 --> 00:28:16.260
If we hadn't broken up,

00:28:16.740 --> 00:28:17.860
or if she knows the truth

00:28:17.980 --> 00:28:18.740
after we get married

00:28:19.060 --> 00:28:20.500
and become husband and wife,

00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:22.140
that will be betraying her.

00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:24.700
I want to marry with true love.

00:28:24.860 --> 00:28:25.740
I don't want a marriage

00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:26.780
like that between you and Dad.

00:28:28.660 --> 00:28:30.740
Don't comment on my marriage.

00:28:31.620 --> 00:28:32.380
We

00:28:32.780 --> 00:28:33.540
may not love each other,

00:28:34.580 --> 00:28:35.900
but we have feelings.

00:28:41.740 --> 00:28:43.380
You've disappointed me.

00:28:44.860 --> 00:28:46.100
So many years have passed,

00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:47.340
and your son has grown up.

00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:50.380
I thought you wouldn't
be blinded by love

00:28:50.380 --> 00:28:51.820
like a young man.

00:28:52.860 --> 00:28:53.620
You are now

00:28:54.140 --> 00:28:55.740
a mature man.

00:28:56.260 --> 00:28:58.140
You have to be responsible

00:28:58.340 --> 00:28:59.740
for your marriage and family.

00:28:59.740 --> 00:29:00.660
What I need to do now

00:29:00.980 --> 00:29:02.620
is to take my responsibility.

00:29:06.820 --> 00:29:07.780
I can't understand

00:29:08.860 --> 00:29:09.820
why you hid

00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:11.340
that Le was born safely?

00:29:12.340 --> 00:29:13.300
You are also a mother.

00:29:16.660 --> 00:29:17.860
Ms. Tan

00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:19.700
is suffering
from severe prenatal depression.

00:29:19.860 --> 00:29:21.220
Here is her test report.

00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:22.260
Please take a look.

00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:29.980
Will it affect the fetus?

00:29:30.220 --> 00:29:31.580
Prenatal depression

00:29:31.580 --> 00:29:33.700
may trigger more serious conditions,

00:29:33.700 --> 00:29:34.860
including pessimistic thoughts.

00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:36.740
Some might have violent tendencies.

00:29:37.180 --> 00:29:37.860
Severely,

00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:40.780
a risk of impulsive, harmful behavior.

00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:42.700
All these are serious

00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:43.460
and dangerous.

00:29:43.740 --> 00:29:45.340
If she carries on like this,

00:29:45.620 --> 00:29:46.740
she could very well lose the baby.

00:29:47.060 --> 00:29:48.260
So, I suggest you

00:29:48.580 --> 00:29:49.780
pay more attention to her emotions.

00:29:49.980 --> 00:29:50.940
Don't let things take their course.

00:29:51.260 --> 00:29:53.740
The best is to make her feel relaxed

00:29:54.220 --> 00:29:55.740
and meet those who make her feel safe.

00:29:55.820 --> 00:29:56.660
That would help.

00:29:56.980 --> 00:29:58.100
In short,

00:29:58.100 --> 00:29:59.420
you must not stimulate her.

00:30:02.260 --> 00:30:02.940
Ms. Tan,

00:30:03.620 --> 00:30:04.220
if you don't eat,

00:30:04.220 --> 00:30:05.380
you won't hold up,

00:30:05.940 --> 00:30:06.860
and it's not good for the baby.

00:30:07.900 --> 00:30:09.180
I said I don't want to eat.

00:30:11.340 --> 00:30:12.380
I heard from Feng Rui

00:30:12.620 --> 00:30:13.700
that fish heads are your favorite.

00:30:13.860 --> 00:30:15.300
I made some fish head soup for you.

00:30:15.460 --> 00:30:16.180
Please have a little.

00:30:24.220 --> 00:30:24.820
Ms. Tan,

00:30:25.860 --> 00:30:26.940
I'll leave the soup on the table.

00:30:27.540 --> 00:30:28.260
I'll go back

00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:29.260
and come back tomorrow morning.

00:30:32.060 --> 00:30:32.460
Doctor,

00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:33.740
it's not even eight months yet.

00:30:33.740 --> 00:30:35.300
Too early for the baby to be born now.

00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:36.900
Try to save the baby first,

00:30:37.300 --> 00:30:38.860
no matter how much money it costs.

00:30:39.460 --> 00:30:40.340
It's critical now.

00:30:40.340 --> 00:30:41.100
Still talking about that?

00:30:41.540 --> 00:30:43.100
Her placental abruption is dangerous.

00:30:44.980 --> 00:30:45.260
Then...

00:30:46.700 --> 00:30:47.060
Please

00:30:48.060 --> 00:30:49.980
ensure the child's safety.

00:30:52.700 --> 00:30:54.020
The baby came suddenly.

00:30:56.260 --> 00:30:57.500
Her condition

00:30:58.860 --> 00:31:00.260
was unstable.

00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:03.540
Couldn't take care of the baby alone.

00:31:05.660 --> 00:31:06.260
I know

00:31:07.220 --> 00:31:08.020
you feel sorry for her,

00:31:10.620 --> 00:31:11.220
but

00:31:11.380 --> 00:31:12.620
you should be grateful

00:31:13.100 --> 00:31:13.580
that Le

00:31:13.940 --> 00:31:15.700
grows up safely and healthily.

00:31:15.900 --> 00:31:17.060
But she lost everything,

00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:18.620
her father

00:31:18.980 --> 00:31:19.580
and her child.

00:31:24.660 --> 00:31:26.340
She would have lost nothing

00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:28.620
if that video...

00:31:28.940 --> 00:31:30.460
Don't bring Haotian's matter up again.

00:31:31.380 --> 00:31:32.740
She has nothing to do with this.

00:31:32.740 --> 00:31:33.460
You know that.

00:31:37.060 --> 00:31:37.820
Tell him,

00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:39.380
he's a murderer!

00:31:39.380 --> 00:31:39.900
Get out!

00:31:39.900 --> 00:31:40.300
Mom.

00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:43.020
Stop talking, Mom.

00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:44.740
[Wealth thrives where fortune dwells.]

00:31:45.460 --> 00:31:46.900
You said you wanted to have a chat.

00:31:55.020 --> 00:31:55.700
Is this girl

00:31:56.660 --> 00:31:57.620
your girlfriend?

00:32:03.620 --> 00:32:04.820
How long have you known each other?

00:32:06.180 --> 00:32:06.740
A few months.

00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:09.140
How did you meet?

00:32:10.220 --> 00:32:11.820
She isn't connected to Haotian's death.

00:32:12.580 --> 00:32:14.100
I know very well what she's like.

00:32:14.900 --> 00:32:16.420
Her family couldn't have done that.

00:32:16.620 --> 00:32:17.420
She is!

00:32:18.860 --> 00:32:20.780
You've only known her for a few months.

00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:23.420
As he colluded with others

00:32:25.740 --> 00:32:26.780
to blackmail Haotian,

00:32:28.860 --> 00:32:31.740
he might use his daughter
to blackmail you.

00:32:32.220 --> 00:32:34.300
There's no such thing as blackmail.

00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:38.180
I'm also heartbroken that Haotian died,

00:32:38.580 --> 00:32:40.060
but don't make baseless accusations.

00:32:40.420 --> 00:32:41.580
I'm looking for evidence.

00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:43.300
If there were evidence,

00:32:43.300 --> 00:32:44.500
the police would have found it.

00:32:45.260 --> 00:32:46.340
You just can't accept

00:32:47.180 --> 00:32:48.180
that Haotian was a rapist.

00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:49.020
Shut up!

00:32:50.940 --> 00:32:51.900
You're my son.

00:32:52.940 --> 00:32:55.580
I won't allow you to be with her.

00:32:59.620 --> 00:33:01.140
You want to be with Tan Siting?

00:33:02.740 --> 00:33:04.300
Is this what you wanted to tell me

00:33:04.300 --> 00:33:04.740
today?

00:33:10.900 --> 00:33:11.260
Yes.

00:33:13.860 --> 00:33:14.860
I want to marry her.

00:33:16.980 --> 00:33:18.940
Do you want her to acknowledge Le?

00:33:19.300 --> 00:33:19.900
You want

00:33:20.300 --> 00:33:21.660
her to acknowledge Le.

00:33:22.060 --> 00:33:23.700
But have you asked Le

00:33:23.980 --> 00:33:25.260
what he thinks?

00:33:25.260 --> 00:33:26.660
Would he be willing?

00:33:27.180 --> 00:33:29.580
No one would refuse their real mother.

00:33:33.180 --> 00:33:35.420
You want to defy me, right?

00:33:37.740 --> 00:33:38.340
Fine,

00:33:40.260 --> 00:33:41.580
we'll see about that.

00:34:04.660 --> 00:34:05.020
Le.

00:34:22.460 --> 00:34:23.180
I know, Dad.

00:34:23.780 --> 00:34:25.740
No music while doing my homework.

00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:32.300
Dad,

00:34:32.780 --> 00:34:33.700
get to the point.

00:34:39.740 --> 00:34:40.500
Ms. Wen

00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:43.300
and I will cancel

00:34:43.300 --> 00:34:44.060
the marriage.

00:34:45.140 --> 00:34:45.660
Dad,

00:34:46.260 --> 00:34:47.540
on another business trip?

00:34:48.260 --> 00:34:49.300
This is a wedding.

00:34:49.580 --> 00:34:51.260
Nothing is more important than that.

00:34:54.780 --> 00:34:55.700
What I mean is,

00:34:56.420 --> 00:34:58.380
Ms. Wen and I

00:34:59.180 --> 00:35:00.060
are no longer together.

00:35:04.620 --> 00:35:05.580
You've broken up.

00:35:06.300 --> 00:35:06.820
I see.

00:35:11.100 --> 00:35:12.540
Don't you want to know why?

00:35:14.380 --> 00:35:16.580
I'm disappointed to hear that,

00:35:17.100 --> 00:35:18.500
but it's between you two.

00:35:18.860 --> 00:35:20.660
My knowing changes nothing.

00:35:25.580 --> 00:35:26.100
Thank you.

00:35:27.580 --> 00:35:29.820
So Ms. Wen didn't get a cold.

00:35:30.380 --> 00:35:31.500
It was because of the breakup.

00:35:34.100 --> 00:35:34.340
Have you

00:35:35.100 --> 00:35:36.580
seen her after coming back?

00:35:37.380 --> 00:35:38.060
Not yet.

00:35:41.060 --> 00:35:41.580
Why?

00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:45.020
I don't understand your business,

00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:46.860
but I think

00:35:46.900 --> 00:35:48.740
she is good to me

00:35:49.580 --> 00:35:50.980
and also very nice to you.

00:35:52.740 --> 00:35:53.580
I think

00:35:53.940 --> 00:35:55.380
you should go to her

00:35:55.420 --> 00:35:57.500
and explain everything clearly.

00:35:57.940 --> 00:35:58.140
Yes,

00:35:58.460 --> 00:35:58.860
I will.

00:36:02.380 --> 00:36:03.500
You are back together?

00:36:05.300 --> 00:36:06.140
Have you decided?

00:36:09.740 --> 00:36:10.460
That day,

00:36:10.620 --> 00:36:11.740
when he came to me,

00:36:12.140 --> 00:36:14.300
I was hesitating whether to tell him

00:36:14.300 --> 00:36:14.900
where you are.

00:36:15.940 --> 00:36:16.740
But later,

00:36:17.420 --> 00:36:18.780
after listening to what he said,

00:36:18.780 --> 00:36:19.660
I felt

00:36:20.300 --> 00:36:21.300
that in this world,

00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:22.860
the most precious thing

00:36:23.500 --> 00:36:24.580
is sincerity.

00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:26.620
I can feel

00:36:27.140 --> 00:36:28.500
that he is sincere to you.

00:36:30.460 --> 00:36:31.180
It's been 12 years.

00:36:32.420 --> 00:36:33.700
We are both victims.

00:36:35.420 --> 00:36:37.780
The misunderstanding between us is deep.

00:36:39.060 --> 00:36:40.820
I thought time could change everything

00:36:40.860 --> 00:36:41.820
and make me forget everything.

00:36:43.100 --> 00:36:43.540
I thought

00:36:43.580 --> 00:36:44.460
our fate

00:36:45.620 --> 00:36:47.380
had ended 12 years ago.

00:36:48.580 --> 00:36:49.740
But I found out I was wrong.

00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:52.820
These 12 years

00:36:52.860 --> 00:36:54.100
have made me understand

00:36:54.380 --> 00:36:55.340
my feelings for him better.

00:36:56.940 --> 00:36:58.540
As long as you've decided,

00:36:59.100 --> 00:37:01.500
I'll support you no matter what.

00:37:04.100 --> 00:37:04.820
However,

00:37:05.260 --> 00:37:06.340
how could Ms. Gao

00:37:07.220 --> 00:37:08.460
do such a thing?

00:37:10.300 --> 00:37:11.460
Given her personality,

00:37:12.260 --> 00:37:13.420
it's quite normal for her

00:37:13.460 --> 00:37:14.220
to do anything.

00:37:15.580 --> 00:37:16.740
We both know

00:37:16.740 --> 00:37:17.500
that without this trip

00:37:17.540 --> 00:37:19.580
to Hongyuan County in Sichuan's Aba,

00:37:19.740 --> 00:37:21.980
we might have missed each other forever.

00:37:26.100 --> 00:37:26.820
You finally

00:37:27.260 --> 00:37:29.140
get your reward after all that hardship.

As long as you love each other,

nothing is an issue.

When I was abroad,

00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:47.820
I often dreamt

Later on, I often visited this place

00:40:09.100 --> 00:40:09.940
and sat here.

You haven't answered me.

00:40:27.300 --> 00:40:28.140
I missed you.

00:40:32.860 --> 00:40:33.940
When

00:40:33.980 --> 00:40:35.220
Le eats Mini Puff,

00:40:35.380 --> 00:40:36.380
he looks exactly like you.

00:40:37.900 --> 00:40:38.780
It makes me feel dazed.

00:40:41.460 --> 00:40:42.900
No matter how often I ask,

00:40:43.140 --> 00:40:44.020
he won't give up

00:40:44.100 --> 00:40:45.060
this food.

00:40:46.140 --> 00:40:46.900
It's all he wants to eat.

00:40:49.300 --> 00:40:50.020
I promise you,

00:40:50.380 --> 00:40:52.020
you won't sit here alone again.

00:40:52.220 --> 00:40:52.900
I'll always be with you.

00:40:58.580 --> 00:40:59.420

00:40:59.660 --> 00:41:00.700
while descending the stairs.

00:41:01.260 --> 00:41:02.900
Updates are available for this case.

00:41:03.460 --> 00:41:05.180
Before his death,

00:41:05.500 --> 00:41:07.100
Mr. Gao Haotian was attempting

00:41:07.220 --> 00:41:08.660
to rape an employee of the company.

00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:11.300
During his attempt to flee,

00:41:11.380 --> 00:41:12.220
he fell from the building accidentally,

00:41:12.300 --> 00:41:13.020
dying instantly at the scene.

00:41:29.060 --> 00:41:29.460
Hello, Mr. Yang.

00:41:31.300 --> 00:41:31.660
Mr. Feng.

00:41:32.460 --> 00:41:33.100
I'm so sorry

00:41:33.300 --> 00:41:34.620
to hear the news.

00:41:35.020 --> 00:41:36.500
Please accept my condolences.

00:41:38.620 --> 00:41:39.140
Thank you.

00:41:41.180 --> 00:41:42.300
Your mother...

00:41:44.100 --> 00:41:45.380
She is not in good health right now

00:41:46.260 --> 00:41:47.100
and can't come to the phone.

00:41:48.180 --> 00:41:49.340
You can tell me what it's about.

00:41:50.780 --> 00:41:51.980
Alright, Mr. Feng.

00:41:52.700 --> 00:41:53.380
Regarding

00:41:54.180 --> 00:41:55.780
the wine I wanted earlier,

00:41:56.260 --> 00:41:57.620
could we postpone it for now?

00:41:58.140 --> 00:41:59.260
Because what happened now

00:41:59.740 --> 00:42:01.500
has caused negative public opinion,

00:42:02.020 --> 00:42:04.100
and it might have an impact.

00:42:06.300 --> 00:42:07.260
Okay, I understand.

00:42:07.940 --> 00:42:10.100
Let's put all our transactions on hold

00:42:10.900 --> 00:42:11.420
for the time being.

00:42:12.300 --> 00:42:13.140
Thanks for your concern.

00:42:13.940 --> 00:42:14.620
I'm really sorry.

00:42:14.780 --> 00:42:15.100
Mr. Feng,

00:42:15.580 --> 00:42:16.380
appreciate your understanding.

00:42:16.740 --> 00:42:17.220
Please take care.

00:42:18.140 --> 00:42:18.540
Take care.

00:42:32.420 --> 00:42:34.100
Turn off your phones.

00:43:16.940 --> 00:43:18.420
overseas suppliers' suspensions.

00:43:19.020 --> 00:43:20.620
A shadow has been cast over its listing.

00:43:21.100 --> 00:43:21.660
