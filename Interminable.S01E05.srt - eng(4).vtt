Who is Khun Yai?

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:12.960
I think he’s quite off.

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:17.330
I also find it strange how he looks exactly like that man in Kaew’s dream.

Keep making merits together and you will always find each other.

Can I join you to give alms to the monk every day?

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.100
Of course.

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.700
Is this the renowned white house of Chao Meun Samur Chairatch?

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.060
How many people live here?

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.020
Why did she want to know how many people live here?

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:36.700
Why asked about my portrait?

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.460
She’s very suspicious indeed.

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.930
His enemy in the past life has finally found him.

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:42.740
What should I do then?

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:49.860
The only thing you can do is be mindful, and brace yourself for whatever that will happen.

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:37.500
I bumped into Khun Yai on his way out, and he heard me saying that you’re also leaving.

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.260
So, he volunteered to drop you off.

She’s probably here by now.

Why does Ajarn Kitti want you to pick up your drawing tonight?

I wonder too, Ruedee. There’s no one here.

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:21.140
It’s not locked.

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:27.500
So quiet.

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:29.660
Isn’t anybody here today?

Yeah.

Hello, Sister.

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:48.159
Isn’t it a semester break, what are you two doing here?

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:51.600
I’m here to get my drawing back from Ajarn.

Is it Ajarn Kitti, my friend?

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:00.620
He’s not in the office though.

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:03.900
That’s weird.

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:06.500
Didn’t he tell you to come see him tonight?

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:09.930
I don’t know too.

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:12.580
But if it’s Kaewta’s drawing,

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:14.100
I saw it on his table.

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:18.620
Let’s go get it then.

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:20.500

Did I say that?

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:29.860

I was holding it in.

00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:24.500
I don’t want anyone to see it when I’m weak.

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:26.900
Is that so?

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:32.140
Since you’re feeling better now, I’m going to go check on Kaewta.

What happened?

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:38.760
The drawing.

00:15:48.130 --> 00:15:49.260
No.

00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:54.980
It’s not here!

00:15:58.460 --> 00:16:00.660
Kaew, what are you looking for?

00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:02.700
That’s right, please tell me, I’ll help look for it.

00:16:03.930 --> 00:16:06.780
My drawing, it’s gone, Ruedee!

00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:08.020
It’s gone!

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:10.180
Kaew.

00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:12.940
Please calm down. It’s all right, Kaew.

00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:16.380
Don’t worry, Kaew. Please calm down.

00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:18.700
Let’s calm down first.

00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:20.860
- Calm down, Kaew.
- Ruedee.

00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:23.260
Kaew.

00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:25.000
Brother, you’re here.

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:27.860
Our driver went to call me, so I came rushing here.

00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:29.360
Kaew.

00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:30.860
Kaew.

00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:32.760
What happened?

00:16:34.730 --> 00:16:36.460
Please calm down, Kaew.

00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:37.660
Please calm down, Kaew.

00:16:38.930 --> 00:16:40.100
It’s going to be all right.

00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:41.540
Everything will be all right, Kaew.

00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:51.960
Easy there.

00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:53.500
Be careful, Khun Kaew.

00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:55.060
You don’t have to carry me.

00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:57.500
I’m fine, Ruedee.

00:16:57.740 --> 00:17:00.340
Don’t be stubborn.

00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:06.260
Do you know how worried my brother and I are?

00:17:06.930 --> 00:17:07.730
Thank you.

00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:11.300
Thank you, Chai.

00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:13.099
Yes.

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:18.660
I would’ve felt so bad if anything happened to you.

00:17:21.819 --> 00:17:26.960
So, what are you going to do about Ajarn Kitti?

00:17:30.730 --> 00:17:32.860
You get punished when you do something wrong.

00:17:34.930 --> 00:17:37.330
I’m going to report this to our chancellor.

00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:41.860
Good, someone like that shouldn’t be teaching anyone again in his life.

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:46.100
- Oh, hello there.
- Hello, Mother Chan.

00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:47.660
You’re back, dear?

00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:49.300
Yes.

00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:53.380
What’s wrong? You’re burning up.

00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:56.300
I’m fine, Mum.

00:17:56.900 --> 00:17:58.820
Just a little tired, that’s all.

00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:05.580
Kaew, go get some rest then.

00:18:05.730 --> 00:18:07.060
We’re leaving.

00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:10.300
Thank you both of you so much…for dropping him off.

00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:11.900
You’re welcome.

00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:15.780
Let’s go home, Brother.

00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:18.860
But Ruedee…

00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:20.260
Let’s go.

00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:24.300
Please excuse us then.

00:18:25.530 --> 00:18:26.160
Goodbye.

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:26.960
Goodbye.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:27.800
Bless you, dear.

00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:29.000
Goodbye, Sin.

00:18:29.730 --> 00:18:30.700
Goodbye, Chai.

00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:42.620
I’ll get you some medicine.

00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:44.060
Yes.

00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:46.340
Please don’t worry.

00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:50.000
Sin.

00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:52.540
Do you need anything, Khun Kaew?

00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:55.500
Nothing.

00:18:56.660 --> 00:18:57.560
I’m just curious.

00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:01.700
Curious? What are you curious about?

00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:05.700
How did you follow me to the university?

00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:09.980
Well, I…

00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:13.860
And Khun Yai too.

00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:17.300
Khun Yai? What about him?

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:25.220
Before I passed out, I saw Khun Yai there.

00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:32.740
It was really him, wasn’t it?

00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:40.220
Yes, Khun Yai was there to help you.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:47.060
Khun Yai was there. It was really him.

00:19:47.930 --> 00:19:52.740
I’m sorry, Khun Yai. But if I had to keep it from him any longer,

00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:56.100
my head could’ve burst from frustration.

00:19:57.060 --> 00:20:00.220
So…where is Khun Yai right now?

00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:02.220
I’m going to thank him.

00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:03.060
You can’t.

00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:06.060
Khun Yai isn’t willing to see anyone right now.

00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:07.460
Why?

00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:11.860
You can’t go, Khun Kaew!

00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:13.660
Khun Yai is badly injured.

00:20:15.530 --> 00:20:17.100
He’s injured?

00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:19.760
Is it because he helped me?

00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:20.730
Khun Kaew.

00:20:20.730 --> 00:20:21.620
I’m going to see him!

00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:22.660
- You can’t.
- Move!

00:20:22.660 --> 00:20:23.580
You can’t go!

00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:25.620
Khun Kaew!

00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:26.660
Khun Kaew!

00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:28.060
Kaew!

00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:29.300
Khun Kaew.

00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:32.940
Are you all right? Let’s get you to your room.

00:20:33.130 --> 00:20:34.540
- Let’s go.
- Oh, dear.

00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:39.540
There you go.

00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:46.540
You’re burning hot, dear.

00:20:47.130 --> 00:20:49.980
Let’s take some pills and get some sleep.

00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:51.420
Give me your hand.

00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:08.860
Khun Yai…Khun Yai is also sick, Mum.

00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:12.160
Oh, is he not feeling well too?

00:21:14.130 --> 00:21:14.930
Yes.

00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:21.460
I’ll go check on him.

00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:22.860
- Khun Kaew.
- No, no.

00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:24.980
No, no. Sit down, dear.

00:21:24.980 --> 00:21:27.900
You can barely walk yourself, how are you going to help him?

00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:31.540
Please don’t worry, Khun Kaew. My da…

00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:37.740
I mean, Saen is looking after Khun Yai right now. He’ll be better soon.

00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:41.140
Really?

00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:44.460
Will he be all right soon?

00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:46.100
Yes.

00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:53.660
My poor baby. You’re this sick yourself but still worry about someone else.

00:21:54.100 --> 00:21:55.980
Now, go get some rest, dear.

00:21:56.260 --> 00:21:57.060
Come.

00:21:57.860 --> 00:21:58.820
Let me help.

00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:00.400
Thank you.

00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:02.340
Let’s go.

00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:17.180
Not again.

00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:21.140
You never listen to me. That’s why.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:23.740
Dad.

00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:25.980
Sin, how’s Khun Kaew?

00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:30.660
How’s Kaew?

00:22:33.130 --> 00:22:34.820
He’s feeling better.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:36.860
Miss Chan is looking after him right now.

00:22:40.220 --> 00:22:41.130
Kaew.

00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:44.540
He’ll be fine.

00:22:44.660 --> 00:22:46.700
It’s you who is in trouble.

00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:47.900
That’s right.

00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:49.860
You must get well soon.

00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:58.260
Khun Kaew saw you when you were there to help him.

00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:02.340
Really?

00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:03.540
Yes, Dad.

00:23:05.330 --> 00:23:07.260
Khun Kaew is very worried about you, Khun Yai.

00:23:07.730 --> 00:23:12.140
Once he’s fully recovered, I’m sure he’s going to ask if he could see you.

00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:23.180
Why did you stop?

00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:25.980
I was enjoying it.

00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:32.100
You keep staring like that, who’d be able to dance?

00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:43.540
If you’re done with the practising, shall we do something else then?

00:25:45.460 --> 00:25:50.020
Khun Yai! It’s still early.

00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:53.580
What were you thinking?

00:26:43.330 --> 00:26:45.180
I love you, Kaewta.

00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:54.700
Please tell me if you also feel the same.

00:27:00.130 --> 00:27:03.620
Isn’t it quite obvious already?

00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:08.980
Still, I want to hear it from you.

00:27:09.620 --> 00:27:11.620
Please say it for me.

00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:21.700
After you come back from a business trip this time,

00:27:22.660 --> 00:27:23.860
I’ll say it.

00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:28.100
Really? Do you promise?

00:27:34.020 --> 00:27:40.530
I promise. When you come back, I’ll say it.

00:28:25.330 --> 00:28:31.140
What the heck? What kind of dream was that?

00:28:45.460 --> 00:28:46.660
That’s right.

00:28:48.730 --> 00:28:49.860
Khun Yai.

00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:03.800
What about your son? How is he?

00:29:05.060 --> 00:29:06.900
He’s not feeling well today, sir.

00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:11.380
Karma is after him for he’s bound by a promise.

00:29:13.530 --> 00:29:14.330
Pardon?

00:29:15.330 --> 00:29:21.740
Tell Kaew, your son, to come to me if he wants to know anything.

00:29:22.260 --> 00:29:24.180
I will help him.

00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:27.820
Yes, sir.

00:29:28.930 --> 00:29:30.060
Bless you.

00:29:42.530 --> 00:29:45.780
Khun Yai! Khun Yai!

00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:53.460
Khun Yai!

00:30:02.730 --> 00:30:04.500
I’m going in then.

00:30:06.420 --> 00:30:07.540
Kaew.

00:30:18.330 --> 00:30:19.540
He’s not here?

00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:23.780
Kaew, are you up, dear?

00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:28.340
How’s your fever? Is it better?

00:30:31.060 --> 00:30:32.900
I’m good now, Mum.

00:30:34.700 --> 00:30:36.260
What are you doing here?

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:40.580
Where’s Khun Yai, Mum?

00:30:41.930 --> 00:30:44.460
Isn’t he in his room?

00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:47.540
No.

00:30:50.060 --> 00:30:51.860
I met Sin this morning.

00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:54.340
He told me Khun Yai is resting in his room.

00:30:56.600 --> 00:30:58.420
So…where are Sin and Saen?

00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:03.300
I’m also looking for them…and Nanny Yam too.

00:31:05.330 --> 00:31:08.100
How odd, where do they all disappear to?

00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:14.500
Or maybe…

00:31:21.660 --> 00:31:24.620
You couldn’t even handle just a weak lad like him.

00:31:24.620 --> 00:31:26.340
How dare you show your face here?

00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:31.330
Who would’ve thought the man in the portrait would suddenly appear to save Kaewta?

00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:36.700
What did you say? The man in the portrait?

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:37.800
Yes.

00:31:38.700 --> 00:31:41.100
Are you sure it’s him?

00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:43.500
Definitely.

00:31:43.860 --> 00:31:46.540
I saw that portrait so often I could clearly picture him in my mind.

00:31:46.730 --> 00:31:49.300
You, bastard! Son of a bitch!

00:31:49.460 --> 00:31:50.300
Get off me!

00:31:50.930 --> 00:31:53.540
I’m going to kill you!

00:31:54.860 --> 00:31:56.140
Khun Yai.

00:31:57.960 --> 00:31:59.060
But…

00:31:59.060 --> 00:32:00.020
But what?

00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:05.100
Nothing.

00:32:05.700 --> 00:32:09.300
It’s just…I can’t go back to work at the university anymore.

00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:10.900
All because of you, Sophee!

00:32:11.660 --> 00:32:13.740
Give me some money right now.

00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:16.160
Why should I? You messed it up yourself.

00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:19.780
If it weren’t for what you told me to do, I wouldn’t have ended up like this.

Are you sure it was because I told you so?

00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:28.100
When I saw the way you looked at Kaewta, I knew right then how you felt about him.

00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:32.760
You also wanted him, didn't you?

00:32:33.130 --> 00:32:34.580
Don’t blame it all on me.

00:32:34.860 --> 00:32:39.700
If they expose me, I’m going to tell them you ordered me to do it.

00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:44.300
Go on then. But do you really think anyone will believe you?

00:32:44.980 --> 00:32:48.060
Don’t forget that I don’t have any problem with Kaewta.

00:32:48.460 --> 00:32:51.460
They’d rather believe it’s you who tries to threaten me.

00:32:52.660 --> 00:32:54.820
You’re more of a sly fox than I thought.

00:32:56.800 --> 00:32:58.780
I’ll take that as a compliment.

00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:06.060
Take it. But it’s not because I’m afraid of you.

00:33:07.930 --> 00:33:09.900
I just pity you.

00:33:19.700 --> 00:33:20.500
Fine.

You lied to me again, Kaewta.

00:33:52.930 --> 00:33:54.220

We could only hope the same method would work on him again this time.

00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:08.420
I’m begging you, my buddha and holy divine gods.

00:34:08.420 --> 00:34:11.620
Khun Yai has been through a lot already.

00:34:11.620 --> 00:34:14.620
I don’t want him to suffer anymore.

00:34:14.860 --> 00:34:19.360
That’s right. He and Khun Kaew have finally met.
And things are going well lately.

00:34:20.730 --> 00:34:23.659
Talking about Khun Kaew, how is he doing?

00:34:24.460 --> 00:34:27.540
I’m wondering too, is he all right now?

00:34:27.540 --> 00:34:30.100
I’d better go make something for him to eat.

00:34:31.159 --> 00:34:33.699

Yes. Thank you, Dad.

00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:17.100
Something is definitely going on.

00:35:20.660 --> 00:35:21.940
I must find out about it.

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:35.800
Saen.

00:35:36.460 --> 00:35:37.260
Yes?

00:35:39.560 --> 00:35:43.020
I don’t know if I’d be able to get through it this time.

00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:45.060
Why did you say that?

00:35:48.260 --> 00:35:50.020
I’m so worried about Kaew.

00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:55.260
Can you do me a favor?

00:35:55.700 --> 00:36:00.330
Please say it. I’ll go through hell and high water for you, Khun Yai.

00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:32.860
Khun Yai has asked me to give this to you, Khun Kaew.

00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:40.860
Me? Why?

00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:43.580
Please take it.

00:37:01.540 --> 00:37:02.340
A ring?

00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:13.460
He told me that if you see this ring, you might remember something.

00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:19.730
Remember what?

00:37:21.260 --> 00:37:22.220

Please excuse me.

00:37:57.260 --> 00:37:58.580
Looks familiar indeed.

00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:03.380
Where have I seen it before?

00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:35.560
What is wrong with me? Stop fantasizing, it’s just a ring.

00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:46.540
My heart still lingers in the old times when I used to be with you.

00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:15.980
Why did he keep talking in riddles?

00:39:17.300 --> 00:39:18.700
This ring too.

00:39:20.330 --> 00:39:21.740
Why would he want to give it to me?

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:31.700
And why does he look exactly like that man in my dream?

00:40:13.330 --> 00:40:14.620
I have to know why.

00:40:28.130 --> 00:40:31.900
If it weren’t because of that bastard, Khun Yai would’ve never been like this.

00:40:50.130 --> 00:40:51.100
Dad.

00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:54.900
Sin, have you done what Khun Yai told you to do?

00:40:55.600 --> 00:41:00.000
Yes, Dad. But it seems Khun Kaew is still doubtful.

00:41:02.660 --> 00:41:05.380
Giving him a ring out of the blue like that, he’s probably surprised.

00:41:10.130 --> 00:41:13.340
I hope Khun Kaew will remember everything about his past life soon.

00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:16.580
Khun Yai has been suffering for so long already.

00:41:18.530 --> 00:41:21.160
So, how’s Khun Yai, Dad?

00:41:23.330 --> 00:41:24.380
He’s better now.

00:41:25.330 --> 00:41:26.660

Make sure you take good care of Khun Yai tonight.

00:41:32.860 --> 00:41:34.380
You said it as if you’re going somewhere.

00:41:46.730 --> 00:41:51.530
Kaew, do you remember Luangta Cham who comes to receive alms in front of our house every day?

00:41:53.660 --> 00:42:00.100
Luangta Cham…I think Saen said his temple is quite close to our house.

00:42:00.300 --> 00:42:01.220
Yes.

00:42:01.620 --> 00:42:05.540
Many women at the market often go meditating with him at the temple.

00:42:05.540 --> 00:42:07.540
So, I asked if I could also tag along.

00:42:09.820 --> 00:42:14.580
Why do you want to go meditating, Mum?

00:42:16.300 --> 00:42:22.260
I believe you’re falling sick this time because of the karma you have done in the past.

00:42:22.940 --> 00:42:29.180
Maybe the merits from meditating could help protect you somehow.

Aww, Mum.

Once you’re feeling well enough, you should go pay respect to Luangta.

00:42:44.980 --> 00:42:52.020
He said if you’re curious about anything, you can just ask him.

00:42:55.330 --> 00:42:57.220
Curious?

00:42:59.730 --> 00:43:01.540
What did he mean by that, Mum?

00:43:02.860 --> 00:43:07.700
I also don’t know, my dear. You have to find out by yourself.

00:43:18.700 --> 00:43:20.130
