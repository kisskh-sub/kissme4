00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:01.600
Eat properly.

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:03.470
Why are you still acting like a kid?

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:04.440
Fidgeting around.

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.090
Drink more of that soup.

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:12.890
Your mom specially made it for you.

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.490
She simmered it all afternoon.

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:21.270
Delicious.

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.950
Right?

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:23.170
Why is it so tasty?

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.120
Mom, I want another bowl.

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:31.720
If you want it, get it yourself.

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:33.050
Do I owe you service?

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.020
How many bowls do you want?

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.180
You've already had several.

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.800
That's enough.

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.770
So should I drink or not?

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.930
I don't care.

00:02:52.088 --> 00:02:53.210
Anyway, I'm done eating.

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:13.460
Mom, why does
your hair today look so nice?

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:15.090
Stop flattering me.

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:18.800
Mom, don't be mad at me.

00:03:21.111 --> 00:03:22.800
Have you really decided to divorce?

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:26.000
Yes.

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:28.720
Didn't I tell you long ago?

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:30.370
Wu Fu

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:33.090
is not reliable.

00:03:35.555 --> 00:03:36.960
Not only is his background bad,

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:38.770
but he's also narrow-minded.

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:42.800
And you insisted on marrying him
no matter what.

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:44.490
Now look.

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:46.650
You wouldn't listen to us elders,

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:48.170
and now you suffer, right?

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:50.560
Not only are you suffering,

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.090
but you also moved out in shame.

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.720
I didn't move out in shame.

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.610
I chose to move out.

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:59.050
And you

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:01.270
still act tough in front of us,

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:02.800
pretending to be smart.

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:05.610
I really didn't expect

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:07.170
that with one careless moment,

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:09.490
you'd suffer such a big loss.

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:11.370
It really makes me furious.

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:13.950
How will you make up for the time

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:15.110
you've lost over these years?

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:16.644
Just thinking about it hurts my heart.

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.600
Fine.

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.360
Since you've decided to divorce,

00:04:24.422 --> 00:04:25.810
you need to settle everything

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.810
with Wu Fu,

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:30.040
bit by bit, clearly and thoroughly.

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:32.920
I'll find you a lawyer.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:34.280
A good lawyer

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:35.650
to help you handle things.

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:38.670
So you won't be smart one moment,

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:39.840
and confused the next.

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:45.380
Dad, let me.

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:46.450
No need. I'm done here.

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:50.450
So?

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:52.920
I did a decent job as the mediator,
right?

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:54.520
You and your mom

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:56.160
talked everything out?

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:59.250
I was even prepared to apologize humbly.

00:04:59.266 --> 00:05:00.150
Didn't expect Mom

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:01.250
to let me off so easily.

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:03.480
But honestly,

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:04.810
she's really naggy.

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:07.480
She's only worried about you.

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:09.480
You're still acting spoiled.

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:14.450
Dad.

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:17.160
I quit my job today.

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:21.130
That's fine.

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:23.450
Things are already like this.

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:26.210
Working together would only
be difficult.

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:26.920
Right?

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:32.720
I just feel like such a failure.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.010
Like all those years were wasted.

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:39.550
I achieved nothing.

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:40.480
Nonsense.

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:42.230
Didn't you just

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:44.720
help that kid get into school?

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:46.890
Just that one thing

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:49.770
is enough to earn you

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:51.650
a big mark in your karma book.

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:57.810
I asked my boss today

00:05:58.590 --> 00:05:59.920
to choose between Wu Fu and me.

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:02.360
He chose Wu Fu.

00:06:04.444 --> 00:06:06.090
Feels like I'm just worse than him.

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:07.822
He just got promoted to director,

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:09.150
and he's handling

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:10.280
so many projects.

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:11.720
As for you,

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:14.480
you just came back from a long leave.

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:17.130
A lot of things have to start from zero.

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:18.550
The boss

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:20.570
being more afraid of losing him
is totally normal.

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:23.810
This doesn't mean
he's better than you, right?

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:25.450
You're so smart.

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:27.890
You'll definitely figure it out.

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:31.890
I know.

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:35.040
But I just

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:38.960
suddenly feel too real.

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:42.040
It's like before,

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:43.480
my life was way too easy.

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:49.920
Everyone works hard

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:52.230
because they're chasing

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:53.520
happiness and joy.

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:55.990
No one would ever want

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:57.920
to live with hardship forever.

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:00.690
So, when you're happy,

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:02.840
you need to learn to enjoy it.

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:05.480
If things don't go your way,

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:07.450
then you have to believe

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:09.720
that Heaven

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:11.210
has other plans for you,

00:07:11.533 --> 00:07:13.280
not because you did something wrong.

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:18.400
In my eyes,

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:20.770
you will always be the best.

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:21.960
You know that?

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:24.770
Thank you, Dad.

00:07:57.888 --> 00:07:59.711
(Sister: I forgot to reply yesterday.)

00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:00.330
(Looks good!)

00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:05.660
(Looks good!)

00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:17.340
(Profile photo)

00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:28.140
(Confirm)

00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:29.940
(Uploading profile photo)

00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:30.888
(Personal information)

00:08:40.310 --> 00:08:42.540
Our team prepared it for you, Jin.

00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:44.200
Everyone really hates to see you go.

00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:47.600
Thank you all.

00:08:47.666 --> 00:08:49.066
The flowers are beautiful.

00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:51.020
You're welcome, Jin.

00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:52.977
These flowers really suit
who you are right now.

00:08:53.022 --> 00:08:54.620
What flowers are these?
Forget-me-not lily.

00:08:54.622 --> 00:08:55.733
The meaning is on the card.

00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:01.900
(How to forget sorrow?
Free your heart.)

00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:08.290
Thank you.

00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:09.540
Goodbye.

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:10.511
We're leaving. Bye-bye.

00:09:24.822 --> 00:09:26.090
(I'm good with the agreement.)

00:09:26.244 --> 00:09:27.410
(Let's set a time to sign.)

00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:31.930
(Saturday at 2 PM.)

00:09:32.311 --> 00:09:34.444
(Meet at the café on Qingping Road.)

00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:36.180
(Send)

00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:52.640
(Sister, tomorrow's the weekend.)

00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:54.170
(You...)

00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:16.480
(We have monthly exams
on Thursday and Friday.)

00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:33.840
(Next week?)

00:10:38.590 --> 00:10:39.240
(This week.)

00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:44.940
(Sister)

00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:54.530
Hello.

00:10:54.888 --> 00:10:57.422
The monthly exam is this week?
You're only telling me now?

00:10:59.190 --> 00:11:00.070
Are you done?

00:11:00.070 --> 00:11:00.810
Not yet.

00:11:01.044 --> 00:11:02.360
There's still one this afternoon.

00:11:03.177 --> 00:11:04.480
What subject is this afternoon?

00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:06.360
Math and physics.

00:11:07.088 --> 00:11:08.800
After the exams, it's the weekend?

00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:13.170
Alright, I'll pick you up tonight.

00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:16.720
Okay.

00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:41.450
Do you want to play
on the computer or watch TV?

00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:44.450
No need.

00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:45.960
I want to read.

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:48.900
You just finished exams.

00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:50.110
No need to be so tense.

00:11:50.110 --> 00:11:51.240
You can relax a bit.

00:11:53.310 --> 00:11:55.360
Before, I never
used those things either.

00:11:55.950 --> 00:11:56.540
So now,

00:11:56.540 --> 00:11:57.933
you should use them even more.

00:12:02.755 --> 00:12:03.960
What do you want to watch?

00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:06.090
Variety shows or anime?

00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:10.090
Sit down.

00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:13.240
I'll go put my bag down.

00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:36.288
Anything you want to watch?

00:12:37.190 --> 00:12:39.000
I'm fine with anything.

00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:41.210
How about a variety show?

00:12:43.422 --> 00:12:44.930
What kind do you want to watch?

00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:48.810
Anything's fine.

00:12:49.470 --> 00:12:50.360
Then...

00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:52.200
let's watch "The Hunger Games Dinner."

00:12:52.222 --> 00:12:53.355
You'll probably like it.

00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:02.480
Okay.

00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:15.620
(The Hunger Games Dinner)

00:13:48.590 --> 00:13:49.640
How is it? Looks good?

00:13:53.510 --> 00:13:54.780
(Three special roles.)

00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:55.540
(The Seer,)

00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:56.160
(the Witch,)

00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:56.920
(the Hunter,)

00:13:57.110 --> 00:13:58.390
(and three villagers.)

00:14:05.710 --> 00:14:06.330
Li Wu.

00:14:15.950 --> 00:14:16.960
Li Wu.

00:14:56.733 --> 00:14:58.360
Did you weigh yourself this week?

00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:01.880
Yeah.

00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:04.880
Gained 0.35 kilograms.

00:15:05.430 --> 00:15:06.470
That's nothing.

00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:07.690
Go to the toilet and it's gone.

00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:10.740
No.

00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:11.620
I see you usually

00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:12.810
eat quite a lot.

00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:15.090
You must be studying too hard.

00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:17.930
It's okay.

00:15:20.866 --> 00:15:22.866
How much did you spend
on your meal card?

00:15:23.070 --> 00:15:23.840
Have you checked?

00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:28.810
326 yuan and 90 cents.

00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:31.570
Three hundred?

00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:34.760
Three hundred yuan in just three weeks?

00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:37.470
Are you eating just plain rice

00:15:37.470 --> 00:15:38.410
or just drinking soup?

00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:43.810
I just eat normally.

00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:46.480
Then, where did the 300 yuan go?

00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:52.990
I left the ledger at school,

00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:54.266
and didn't bring it back.

00:15:59.110 --> 00:16:00.590
I don't need you

00:16:00.590 --> 00:16:01.600
to save money for me.

00:16:01.666 --> 00:16:03.244
And you don't need to pay me back.

00:16:03.310 --> 00:16:05.330
You're making it seem like
I'm abusing you.

00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:08.170
Well...

00:16:08.990 --> 00:16:10.810
You eat so much in front of me,

00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:13.290
but when you go back
to school, you're starving?

00:16:14.350 --> 00:16:14.840
I...

00:16:16.070 --> 00:16:16.810
No.

00:16:46.590 --> 00:16:48.140
So just by looking at someone's meals,

00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:49.977
you can judge
if they treat themselves well?

00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:51.330
Of course.

00:16:51.830 --> 00:16:52.760
Eating properly

00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:54.000
is treating yourself well.

00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:55.880
Eating is so enjoyable.

00:16:56.900 --> 00:16:58.240
And you're at the age

00:16:58.430 --> 00:16:59.690
where you're still growing.

00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:01.644
If you don't eat well, how do you grow?

00:17:01.830 --> 00:17:03.170
And with that study load,

00:17:03.311 --> 00:17:04.533
where do you get the energy?

00:17:07.150 --> 00:17:08.440
But you eat very little.

00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:10.440
What?

00:17:13.340 --> 00:17:14.730
You eat very little too.

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:19.640
That's just my appetite.

00:17:20.710 --> 00:17:22.290
I do eat until I'm full at each meal.

00:17:25.780 --> 00:17:27.990
So you mean if I'm not full,

00:17:27.990 --> 00:17:29.730
I have no right
to ask you anything, right?

00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:33.970
That's not what I meant.

00:18:10.933 --> 00:18:12.730
I'm so stuffed
that I'm about to throw up.

00:18:12.822 --> 00:18:14.355
Do I have the right to ask you now?

00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:19.090
From 300 yuan in three weeks

00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:20.680
to 300 yuan a week.

00:18:20.950 --> 00:18:21.680
Can you do that?

00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:24.840
I don't need that much.

00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:26.330
Then try to use it.

00:19:05.910 --> 00:19:06.490
Li Wu.

00:19:07.333 --> 00:19:08.177
I'm heading out.

00:19:08.177 --> 00:19:10.190
I found an auntie to clean the house
this afternoon.

00:19:10.230 --> 00:19:11.444
Keep an eye on the doorbell.

00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:12.600
Okay.

00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:27.340
(Male: Wu Fu. Female: Cen Jin)

00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:38.260
(Divorce agreement)

00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:41.400
Pretty well prepared.

00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:43.330
Habit.

00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:46.820
Sir, your coffee.

00:19:46.820 --> 00:19:47.400
Thanks.

00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:55.580
(Female: Cen Jin)

00:20:10.540 --> 00:20:11.970
I can take leave on Monday morning

00:20:12.044 --> 00:20:13.066
to process the paperwork.

00:20:13.990 --> 00:20:14.490
Okay.

00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:19.266
You look beautiful today.

00:20:20.950 --> 00:20:21.570
Thank you.

00:20:21.910 --> 00:20:23.090
I look beautiful every day.

00:20:27.977 --> 00:20:29.090
Once the transfer is done,

00:20:29.133 --> 00:20:31.333
I'll give you the house payment
as soon as possible.

00:20:33.630 --> 00:20:34.640
You're quick.

00:20:35.470 --> 00:20:36.330
Quite eager, huh?

00:20:41.060 --> 00:20:42.360
I'm not eager.

00:20:42.822 --> 00:20:44.250
I just don't want to owe you money.

00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:47.020
When we chose this house,

00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:48.160
it was to make you happy.

00:20:48.910 --> 00:20:51.970
And now, I've even paid you back
the renovation cost.

00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:54.050
No need to bring this up, right?

00:20:56.060 --> 00:20:56.840
Did I?

00:20:57.630 --> 00:20:58.600
You're too sensitive.

00:21:00.670 --> 00:21:01.640
Right back at you.

00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:05.730
Honestly, reaching this point

00:21:06.260 --> 00:21:07.600
was never my intention.

00:21:07.977 --> 00:21:09.470
Wu Fu, there's really no need for you

00:21:09.470 --> 00:21:10.755
to say things like this now.

00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:12.970
I'm not trying to dig up the past.

00:21:13.910 --> 00:21:15.150
And no need to say

00:21:15.150 --> 00:21:17.422
that everything you did before
was to make me happy.

00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:23.088
We were different people to begin with.

00:21:24.333 --> 00:21:25.755
Let's break up with dignity.

00:21:30.177 --> 00:21:31.711
What are your plans after this?

00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:34.330
Find a company I like.

00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:35.688
Continue doing creative work.

00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:36.730
Next time we meet,

00:21:37.230 --> 00:21:38.490
we'll be competitors.

00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:42.090
I thought

00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:44.000
you would go to a client-side company.

00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:45.770
Between tormenting others,

00:21:45.950 --> 00:21:47.060
I prefer the creativity

00:21:47.060 --> 00:21:47.770
and writing copy.

00:21:48.733 --> 00:21:50.866
Looking forward to seeing
you on the battlefield.

00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:06.010
Cen Jin.

00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:11.330
Anything else?

00:22:11.844 --> 00:22:13.644
I still have some of your things
in my car,

00:22:13.820 --> 00:22:14.740
including some gifts

00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:15.730
you gave me.

00:22:15.870 --> 00:22:16.680
Take them back.

00:22:18.740 --> 00:22:19.330
No need.

00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:20.490
I don't want them.

00:22:21.020 --> 00:22:22.120
They weren't cheap.

00:22:22.670 --> 00:22:23.400
I don't want them.

00:22:23.933 --> 00:22:24.920
If you don't want them,

00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:25.770
throw them away.

00:24:46.380 --> 00:24:49.300
(Sweet Cottage)
(Dear Ms. Cen Jin, Happy Birthday.)

00:25:17.670 --> 00:25:18.640
Incorrect password.

00:25:35.740 --> 00:25:36.570
Li Wu?

00:25:40.710 --> 00:25:41.530
Why are you here?

00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:43.680
Ms. Cen helped me transfer
to study here.

00:25:50.950 --> 00:25:51.640
Do you live here?

00:25:52.466 --> 00:25:53.488
I live on campus.

00:25:55.060 --> 00:25:56.010
Are you looking for her?

00:25:57.780 --> 00:25:59.020
She left some things with me.

00:25:59.020 --> 00:26:00.288
I'm here to give them back.

00:26:01.430 --> 00:26:02.010
Is she home?

00:26:02.150 --> 00:26:02.680
No.

00:26:04.150 --> 00:26:05.010
She went out.

00:26:08.990 --> 00:26:10.290
Do you know where she went?

00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:11.160
I don't know.

00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:15.600
Alright.

00:26:16.150 --> 00:26:16.810
Here, take it.

00:26:17.133 --> 00:26:18.377
Make sure to give it to her.

00:26:22.540 --> 00:26:24.177
You seem to have grown a lot taller.

00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:27.840
I'm already taller than you now.

00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:32.570
Are you blaming me for not helping you?

00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:33.570
No.

00:26:38.670 --> 00:26:39.640
I just want to say,

00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:41.330
actually,

00:26:41.990 --> 00:26:42.770
we...

00:26:43.580 --> 00:26:44.770
We had no obligation.

00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:47.680
Cen Jin is a good person,

00:26:48.430 --> 00:26:49.770
but she's idealistic.

00:26:50.088 --> 00:26:52.340
She's kind, but when faced
with things like this...

00:26:52.340 --> 00:26:53.730
She's idealistic and kind.

00:26:54.390 --> 00:26:55.330
So you bullied her?

00:27:00.470 --> 00:27:01.600
What did she tell you?

00:27:02.088 --> 00:27:03.970
She never mentioned you, not even once.

00:27:04.990 --> 00:27:06.160
But I know

00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:07.680
everything you did.

00:27:20.780 --> 00:27:21.880
How impressive.

00:27:23.150 --> 00:27:25.290
Letting a kid stand up for you now?

00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:32.090
I'm not a kid anymore.

00:27:32.977 --> 00:27:34.466
If you don't believe me, try me.

00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:55.330
Does Cen Jin

00:27:56.190 --> 00:27:57.640
know you're like this?

00:27:58.533 --> 00:28:00.044
Aren't you afraid I'll tell her?

00:28:00.740 --> 00:28:01.330
I am,

00:28:03.260 --> 00:28:04.730
but I want you to know even more.

00:29:20.230 --> 00:29:21.330
Still doing homework?

00:29:24.820 --> 00:29:25.970
Did you eat dinner?

00:29:28.155 --> 00:29:29.360
I'm asking you a question.

00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:31.250
Not yet.

00:29:32.230 --> 00:29:32.970
Aren't you hungry?

00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:37.730
I'm hungry. I want food.

00:29:38.580 --> 00:29:39.200
There is food.

00:29:46.577 --> 00:29:48.600
Why do you keep turning off the lights?

00:29:49.820 --> 00:29:50.570
Saving electricity.

00:29:51.910 --> 00:29:53.160
Is it you who pays the bills?

00:29:53.540 --> 00:29:54.290
Turn on the light.

00:30:10.910 --> 00:30:12.400
Those things were sent by Wu Fu?

00:30:19.230 --> 00:30:20.160
You let him in?

00:30:25.100 --> 00:30:26.050
If he comes again,

00:30:26.622 --> 00:30:27.570
don't open the door.

00:31:06.150 --> 00:31:07.360
Didn't you say there was food?

00:31:08.300 --> 00:31:08.810
There is.

00:31:20.470 --> 00:31:21.530
This is...

00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:23.970
A birthday cake...

00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:26.290
Is today your birthday?

00:31:28.540 --> 00:31:30.160
Isn't today your birthday?

00:31:30.630 --> 00:31:31.530
My birthday?

00:31:31.990 --> 00:31:32.840
Who said that?

00:31:34.300 --> 00:31:34.770
Because...

00:31:34.933 --> 00:31:36.670
This afternoon,
I received a text message.

00:31:36.670 --> 00:31:38.120
It said today is your birthday.

00:31:40.150 --> 00:31:40.680
Look.

00:31:42.630 --> 00:31:44.680
I just fill in
those membership forms randomly.

00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:46.955
My birthday is August 2nd.
It's long passed.

00:31:52.222 --> 00:31:54.010
Where did you get
the money to buy a cake?

00:31:56.990 --> 00:31:58.840
I have a bit of money too.

00:32:02.244 --> 00:32:03.866
Don't spend money randomly again.

00:32:06.580 --> 00:32:07.777
Good timing. I'm hungry.

Top in our class for physics.

00:34:57.990 --> 00:35:00.300
(Physics answer sheet: Li Wu)
This score even ranks well in the rocket class.

00:35:02.790 --> 00:35:04.800
How did you guys study?

00:35:06.180 --> 00:35:08.160
He's been here for less than a month.

got wrong again.

00:35:30.470 --> 00:35:31.640

You're incredible!

00:36:13.910 --> 00:36:14.500
Can that sheet

00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:15.720
show the whole school ranking?

00:36:16.430 --> 00:36:17.010
Hold on.

00:36:26.540 --> 00:36:28.010
Seventy-eight.

00:36:39.140 --> 00:36:39.850
What's wrong?

00:36:42.020 --> 00:36:43.970
Seventy-eight is already amazing.

00:36:44.750 --> 00:36:45.270
Why are you

00:36:45.270 --> 00:36:46.911
looking like your soul left your body?

00:36:48.180 --> 00:36:49.760
I didn't get top 30.

00:36:50.500 --> 00:36:51.450
Dude.

00:36:52.140 --> 00:36:53.620
Top 30 are all rocket-class kids.

00:36:53.620 --> 00:36:55.240
They're monsters, okay?

00:36:56.830 --> 00:36:58.310
You're really annoying like this.

00:36:58.310 --> 00:36:59.370
So dramatic.

00:37:00.100 --> 00:37:01.180
If I hadn't known Tao Wanwen

00:37:01.180 --> 00:37:02.200
for so many years,

00:37:02.244 --> 00:37:04.577
it would be really hard
to get used to another her.

00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:06.090
Who is Tao Wanwen?

00:37:06.910 --> 00:37:08.320
That's not the point.

00:37:09.270 --> 00:37:11.490
The point is, you ranked 78.

00:37:11.830 --> 00:37:13.090
That's already great.

00:37:13.990 --> 00:37:14.800
Be content.

00:38:05.950 --> 00:38:07.180

You're back.

00:38:19.866 --> 00:38:20.955
Where did you go just now?

00:38:21.022 --> 00:38:22.280
I couldn't find you anywhere.

00:38:22.311 --> 00:38:23.950
The teacher asked me
to move some materials.

00:38:23.950 --> 00:38:24.580
What's wrong?

00:38:24.580 --> 00:38:27.010
Well... There are two questions
I can't solve.

00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:28.511
Help explain them to me.

00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:30.060
Wait a second.

00:38:30.060 --> 00:38:31.540
Let's add each other on WeChat first,

00:38:31.540 --> 00:38:32.890
so next time I can find you.

00:38:33.790 --> 00:38:35.100
Li Wu doesn't socialize.

00:38:35.100 --> 00:38:36.320
Are you sure he has WeChat?

00:38:37.910 --> 00:38:38.640
I do.

00:38:39.220 --> 00:38:40.570
You have WeChat?

00:38:41.270 --> 00:38:43.090
You have WeChat but didn't add us first?

00:38:43.580 --> 00:38:44.530
Scan ours.

00:38:44.700 --> 00:38:45.370
Come on.

00:38:46.244 --> 00:38:47.450
It's outrageous not to add us.

00:38:48.540 --> 00:38:49.090
Forget it.

00:38:49.700 --> 00:38:50.470
We'll scan yours.

00:38:50.470 --> 00:38:51.090
Yeah.

00:38:52.911 --> 00:38:54.240
Don't let me scan yours.

00:38:57.180 --> 00:38:57.990
I sent it.

00:38:57.990 --> 00:38:58.680
Approve me.

00:38:59.220 --> 00:38:59.760
Approved...

00:39:01.180 --> 00:39:02.320
Let me show you how to do it.

00:39:02.870 --> 00:39:03.490
It's here.

00:39:04.900 --> 00:39:07.340
(Sister)

00:39:07.430 --> 00:39:08.320
I sent it to you.

00:39:09.422 --> 00:39:11.160
You only have one person in your WeChat?

00:39:11.377 --> 00:39:13.177
And you say you're not
in an online romance.

00:39:14.020 --> 00:39:14.970
No, this...

00:39:15.750 --> 00:39:16.890
This is my sister.

00:39:17.100 --> 00:39:17.800
Your sister?

00:39:17.950 --> 00:39:18.500
Is she pretty?

00:39:18.500 --> 00:39:19.350
Does she post photos?

00:39:19.350 --> 00:39:20.490
Show us, hurry.

00:39:22.910 --> 00:39:23.680
Moments?

00:39:24.310 --> 00:39:25.410
No way.

00:39:25.830 --> 00:39:27.180
Don't tell me you don't even know

00:39:27.180 --> 00:39:28.090
what Moments is.

00:39:29.220 --> 00:39:30.050
Here, look at mine.

00:39:32.270 --> 00:39:33.370
This is called Moments.

00:39:33.790 --> 00:39:34.800
You post here.

00:39:36.660 --> 00:39:37.060
Look.

00:39:37.060 --> 00:39:37.970
No...

00:39:39.350 --> 00:39:40.370
Why not?

00:39:40.870 --> 00:39:41.390
Isn't Moments

00:39:41.390 --> 00:39:42.310
for friends to see?

00:39:42.310 --> 00:39:42.800
Yeah.

00:39:43.180 --> 00:39:45.090
I'll explain the questions to you.

00:39:45.390 --> 00:39:45.930
Okay.

00:39:46.390 --> 00:39:47.180
Sorry.

00:39:47.180 --> 00:39:48.311
Let me squeeze by first.

00:39:50.950 --> 00:39:52.490
A little secret.

00:39:52.533 --> 00:39:53.720
He has a little secret.

00:39:54.870 --> 00:39:55.760
He has a little secret.

00:39:56.430 --> 00:39:57.580
Or maybe you're not a friend,

00:39:57.580 --> 00:39:58.570
so he won't let you see.

00:39:58.790 --> 00:39:59.410
No, you're not.

00:39:59.844 --> 00:40:01.010
You're not even his friend.
