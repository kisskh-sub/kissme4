(Liang Er)
The confession has already been published.

00:01:14.312 --> 00:01:15.392
Useless fool.

00:01:15.687 --> 00:01:17.191
It's my fault.

00:01:17.192 --> 00:01:18.312
I'm the useless one.

00:01:18.575 --> 00:01:19.911
Chief Song.

00:01:19.912 --> 00:01:21.471
Please be generous.

00:01:21.472 --> 00:01:22.592
I beg you.

00:01:23.392 --> 00:01:24.711
Please help me get my son back.

00:01:24.712 --> 00:01:26.107
I beg you.

00:01:26.312 --> 00:01:27.712
What does that have to do with me?

00:01:33.112 --> 00:01:34.912
Can you please

00:01:35.552 --> 00:01:37.872
go to Chengyun Society
and bring Guang back?

00:01:37.992 --> 00:01:40.072
I'll do anything you want afterward.

00:01:40.787 --> 00:01:42.547
Now you're anxious?

00:01:43.112 --> 00:01:44.432
Too late.

00:01:44.712 --> 00:01:48.072
You didn't think of this when you
lied to me back then?

00:01:52.992 --> 00:01:54.552
Chief Song.

00:01:57.912 --> 00:01:59.231
Why are you here?

00:01:59.232 --> 00:02:00.411
Where's Guang?

00:02:00.412 --> 00:02:01.631
Get lost!

00:02:01.632 --> 00:02:04.031
I'm working for Chief Song now.

00:02:04.032 --> 00:02:06.311
Don't come to me about you
and that brat.

00:02:06.312 --> 00:02:08.392
How can you be so heartless?

00:02:08.712 --> 00:02:11.151
Guang is your own son!

00:02:11.152 --> 00:02:13.472
You were a whore before you married me.

00:02:13.552 --> 00:02:16.312
Who knows whose scoundrel
that kid really is.

00:02:18.552 --> 00:02:19.672
Chief Song.

00:02:20.112 --> 00:02:21.312
Have you figured it out?

00:02:21.872 --> 00:02:23.152
She is Liang Yi.

00:02:26.632 --> 00:02:27.991
I swear on my life

00:02:27.992 --> 00:02:29.791
that she pretended
to be a ghost that night

00:02:29.792 --> 00:02:32.992
and scared Liang Er
into signing the confession.

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.070
I want the Liang family.
Will you give it to me?

00:02:40.872 --> 00:02:43.272
You really never stop surprising me.

00:02:45.352 --> 00:02:46.551
Chief Song.

00:02:46.552 --> 00:02:48.311
You promised me before

00:02:48.312 --> 00:02:50.271
that if her identity was confirmed,

00:02:50.272 --> 00:02:52.391
you'd clear my gambling debt.

00:02:52.392 --> 00:02:53.271
Now, look...

00:02:53.272 --> 00:02:54.432
Don't worry.

00:02:55.072 --> 00:02:57.272
I always keep my word.

00:03:15.992 --> 00:03:18.152
The dead don't need to repay debts.

00:03:19.775 --> 00:03:21.135
Poor fool.

00:03:21.792 --> 00:03:24.032
Go collect your paper money
on your way to the underworld.

00:03:31.872 --> 00:03:33.311
You didn't expect that, did you?

00:03:33.312 --> 00:03:34.951
I didn't expect it either

00:03:34.952 --> 00:03:37.391
that she's actually Liang Yi.

00:03:37.392 --> 00:03:40.191
(Confession. Liang Er)
Teaming up with Lin Yun to trick me.

00:03:40.192 --> 00:03:41.591
You really are stupid.

00:03:41.592 --> 00:03:43.992
Sold out and still helping
count the money.

00:03:44.212 --> 00:03:45.972
She must hate me deeply.

00:03:46.592 --> 00:03:48.832
Guang will die in her hands.

00:03:49.112 --> 00:03:51.071
Chief Song, I'm begging you.

00:03:51.072 --> 00:03:53.311
For the sake of all the years
I risked my life for you,

00:03:53.312 --> 00:03:55.151
please save Guang.

00:03:55.152 --> 00:03:56.191
I beg you.

00:03:56.192 --> 00:03:57.312
Risked your life?

00:03:57.832 --> 00:03:58.872
You?

00:03:59.592 --> 00:04:02.632
All you've ever done
is cause trouble for me.

00:04:04.675 --> 00:04:07.071
If it weren't for that pretty face
being useful,

00:04:07.072 --> 00:04:08.992
I would've shot you dead long ago.

00:04:15.792 --> 00:04:18.191
Song Zhichu, you scoundrel!

00:04:18.192 --> 00:04:20.471
You're the one who committed
all the sins!

00:04:20.472 --> 00:04:22.149
You're the one who should die!

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.170
Why should my Guang suffer for you?!

00:04:34.552 --> 00:04:35.551
Madam Lin.

00:04:35.552 --> 00:04:36.991
We've already followed your orders

00:04:36.992 --> 00:04:39.036
and spread the confession.

00:04:39.037 --> 00:04:40.757
Not enough.

00:04:40.872 --> 00:04:42.392
Far from enough.

00:04:42.872 --> 00:04:44.271
I want everyone in Rong City

00:04:44.272 --> 00:04:46.111
to see this confession.

00:04:46.112 --> 00:04:48.992
I want all of his crimes exposed
to the world.

00:04:49.552 --> 00:04:52.551
Song Zhichu colluded with Liang Er,

00:04:52.552 --> 00:04:54.391
cruelly murdered Liang Wenbin,

00:04:54.392 --> 00:04:56.271
seized the Liang family property,

00:04:56.272 --> 00:04:58.471
and tortured the Liang family's
young lady.

00:04:58.472 --> 00:05:01.271
They replaced the real Liang Yi
with a fake one.

00:05:01.272 --> 00:05:02.751
Such vile acts,

00:05:02.752 --> 00:05:04.511
detestable and unforgivable.

00:05:04.512 --> 00:05:05.591
Madam Lin.

00:05:05.592 --> 00:05:07.311
How do you know all of this so clearly?

00:05:07.312 --> 00:05:07.911
Because...

00:05:07.912 --> 00:05:08.831
We received a tip-off.

00:05:08.832 --> 00:05:10.471
Someone is conducting
illegal dealings here

00:05:10.472 --> 00:05:12.032
and spreading malicious rumors.

00:05:12.672 --> 00:05:13.952
Is that so, Madam Lin?

00:05:16.312 --> 00:05:17.391
Chief Song.

00:05:17.392 --> 00:05:20.312
I heard that you maliciously harmed
the Liang household, murdered...

00:05:30.472 --> 00:05:32.712
Anyone else want to spread lies
and mislead people?

00:05:35.752 --> 00:05:37.112
Sorry, Madam Lin.

00:05:37.837 --> 00:05:40.600
Today you're gathering a crowd,
causing trouble and endangering society.

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:42.751
I can only act according to the law.

00:05:42.752 --> 00:05:44.751
Song Zhichu.

00:05:44.752 --> 00:05:46.312
You are shameless!

00:05:48.592 --> 00:05:49.792
Take her away.

00:06:05.392 --> 00:06:06.791
Liang Yi.

00:06:06.792 --> 00:06:08.886
Quite capable, huh.

00:06:08.887 --> 00:06:11.006
Let me have a good look at you now.

00:06:11.007 --> 00:06:13.407
Your current self

00:06:13.575 --> 00:06:16.424
is completely different from before.

00:06:16.425 --> 00:06:18.391
Don't touch me with your dirty hands.

00:06:18.392 --> 00:06:19.549
Dirty?

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:22.592
Weren't you the one who liked
Zhichu the most?

00:06:24.072 --> 00:06:25.792
I was blind before.

00:06:25.912 --> 00:06:29.199
Otherwise, how could I have been deceived
by a despicable person like you?

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:30.611
Didn't see it coming.

00:06:30.612 --> 00:06:32.611
I saw you enjoying being fooled by me,

00:06:32.612 --> 00:06:35.070
calling out "Zhichu" repeatedly.

00:06:35.472 --> 00:06:37.591
You just took advantage of my trust

00:06:37.592 --> 00:06:40.512
and my emotional naivety and ignorance.

00:06:40.872 --> 00:06:42.112
So what?

00:06:42.975 --> 00:06:43.374
Liang Yi.

00:06:43.375 --> 00:06:45.335
Do you know what I hate most about you?

00:06:45.862 --> 00:06:47.382
Being self-righteous.

00:06:47.432 --> 00:06:49.111
You always thought you were smart,

00:06:49.112 --> 00:06:50.951
and looked down on everyone else.

00:06:50.952 --> 00:06:54.232
I wanted to see if that "brains"
of yours are actually useful.

00:06:55.352 --> 00:06:57.672
Didn't expect your true nature
to show in a few moves.

00:06:58.037 --> 00:06:59.636
Stupid woman.

00:06:59.637 --> 00:07:01.351
You really thought I cared about you?

00:07:01.352 --> 00:07:03.592
I only cared about the Liang family.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.079
Your feigned modesty

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:08.671
is bland and tasteless,

00:07:08.672 --> 00:07:10.072
completely meaningless.

00:07:11.472 --> 00:07:13.231
Now that I have the Liang family.

00:07:13.232 --> 00:07:15.431
What kind of woman can't I get?

00:07:15.432 --> 00:07:16.831
Shameless.

00:07:16.832 --> 00:07:18.232
Despicable.

00:07:19.192 --> 00:07:20.312
Honestly,

00:07:20.672 --> 00:07:23.032
I really like the way you are now.

00:07:24.072 --> 00:07:25.471
What?

00:07:25.472 --> 00:07:27.112
Trained by Lin Yun?

00:07:30.632 --> 00:07:31.872
Disgusting.

00:07:35.112 --> 00:07:37.136
No need to rush to anger me.

00:07:37.137 --> 00:07:39.337
I won't touch you for now.

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:42.524
What do you want to do?

00:07:42.525 --> 00:07:45.911
Didn't expect the wedding
to make you sleep together

00:07:45.912 --> 00:07:48.152
and develop true feelings.

00:07:52.272 --> 00:07:55.431
Time for that worn-out husband
of yours to come save you, right?

00:07:55.432 --> 00:07:56.511
Song Zhichu.

00:07:56.512 --> 00:07:59.471
I am the one with a grudge against you.
Lin Yun was just used by me.

00:07:59.472 --> 00:08:00.471
Any issues, come at me.

00:08:00.472 --> 00:08:01.711
Don't involve him!

00:08:01.712 --> 00:08:05.191
You can't even handle yourself
and you're worrying about him?

00:08:05.192 --> 00:08:07.152
You haven't really fallen
in love with him, have you?

00:08:10.112 --> 00:08:11.832
Song Zhichu, you beast!

00:08:11.872 --> 00:08:12.992
Don't forget.

00:08:14.887 --> 00:08:17.462
You will always be my woman.

00:08:18.872 --> 00:08:19.871
Let her go!

00:08:19.872 --> 00:08:21.152
Let her go!

00:08:22.112 --> 00:08:23.312
Let go!

00:08:30.472 --> 00:08:31.511
Lin Yun.

00:08:31.512 --> 00:08:32.351
Go!

00:08:32.352 --> 00:08:34.071
He deliberately called you here
to provoke you,

00:08:34.072 --> 00:08:37.000
just to frame you for breaking
out of prison. Go!

00:08:39.232 --> 00:08:40.071
Don't touch her!

00:08:40.072 --> 00:08:42.311
What a tragic love story.

00:08:42.312 --> 00:08:44.631
If I knew today, why bother back then?

00:08:44.632 --> 00:08:46.431
You're really a troublemaker.

00:08:46.432 --> 00:08:49.132
Today I want to savor your taste.

00:08:58.832 --> 00:09:00.792
Stop hitting, go!

00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:13.249
I will never leave you alone again.

00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:14.191
Scared?

00:09:14.192 --> 00:09:15.312
Not scared.

00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:16.219
Take this.

00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:17.300
For self-defense.

00:09:23.112 --> 00:09:24.632
You're finished.

00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:41.120
(Follow discipline, obey orders)

00:09:51.352 --> 00:09:52.151
Boss.

00:09:52.152 --> 00:09:53.992
Why didn't you call the brothers
when fighting?

00:09:56.032 --> 00:09:58.232
Brat, you're not too late.

00:10:33.412 --> 00:10:36.071
I couldn't kill you last time.

00:10:36.072 --> 00:10:39.072
Today I will personally send you
to meet King Yama.

00:10:41.637 --> 00:10:42.712
Scoundrel!

00:11:05.550 --> 00:11:06.950
Go quickly.

00:11:31.512 --> 00:11:33.631
Lock down the city immediately
and search!

00:11:33.632 --> 00:11:36.151
I want them to pay for Zhichu's death!

00:11:36.152 --> 00:11:36.952
Yes.

00:12:11.992 --> 00:12:13.552
Why the long face?

00:12:14.032 --> 00:12:16.951
You killed that beast yourself,
vengeance is served.

00:12:16.952 --> 00:12:18.832
You should be happy.

00:12:19.632 --> 00:12:22.792
I dragged you into this.

00:12:22.992 --> 00:12:24.511
Fool.

00:12:24.512 --> 00:12:26.752
Without you,
I would have killed him anyway.

00:12:28.392 --> 00:12:30.231
But if it weren't for me,

00:12:30.232 --> 00:12:32.071
you wouldn't be in such a mess.

00:12:32.072 --> 00:12:33.272
Right?

00:12:34.072 --> 00:12:35.471
No matter how perfect

00:12:35.472 --> 00:12:37.392
the plan is, there is uncertainties.

00:12:38.632 --> 00:12:40.632
If you are that uncertainty,

00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:42.790
I only think it's worth it more.

00:12:48.912 --> 00:12:52.111
Boss. Song Ming has mobilized
all the city's military and police.

00:12:52.112 --> 00:12:53.711
He's determined to catch you.

00:12:53.712 --> 00:12:57.351
They will surely block all exits
from the city.

00:12:57.352 --> 00:12:59.992
Looks like we can only escape
by water secretly.

00:13:00.632 --> 00:13:01.951
Then I'll go find

00:13:01.952 --> 00:13:03.632
Feng, who always helps us with boats.

00:13:05.592 --> 00:13:06.511
Give him this.

00:13:06.512 --> 00:13:07.591
Consider it the fare.

00:13:07.592 --> 00:13:08.712
I'm on it.

00:13:24.712 --> 00:13:25.951
Is this your plan?

00:13:25.952 --> 00:13:27.391
To be a fugitive for life?

00:13:27.392 --> 00:13:28.991
What exactly are you trying to say?

00:13:28.992 --> 00:13:31.271
We finally got to this point.

00:13:31.272 --> 00:13:33.161
Now you want to save Madam Lin,

00:13:33.162 --> 00:13:36.042
and ruin all these years
of revenge plans?

00:13:37.352 --> 00:13:41.151
She is my legally wedded wife.

00:13:41.152 --> 00:13:44.031
But she's fake.

00:13:44.032 --> 00:13:46.271
She killed Song Zhichu!

00:13:46.272 --> 00:13:47.351
In my opinion,

00:13:47.352 --> 00:13:49.631
you should cut ties with her now.

00:13:49.632 --> 00:13:51.111
Hand her over to Song Ming.

00:13:51.112 --> 00:13:52.112
Liu Xiu.

00:13:52.752 --> 00:13:54.872
Are you speaking human language?

00:13:55.472 --> 00:13:57.191
You called her "Madam Lin" for so long,

00:13:57.192 --> 00:13:59.392
and you can still be so heartless?

00:14:00.152 --> 00:14:01.471
Yes.

00:14:01.472 --> 00:14:03.151
She is a good woman.

00:14:03.152 --> 00:14:04.311
But I've watched you all along,

00:14:04.312 --> 00:14:05.791
enduring so much suffering

00:14:05.792 --> 00:14:07.471
and humiliation to take revenge

00:14:07.472 --> 00:14:09.191
on Song Ming.

00:14:09.192 --> 00:14:11.552
All for a woman,
are you going to abandon everything?

00:14:12.112 --> 00:14:13.791
If not for her,

00:14:13.792 --> 00:14:16.791
we wouldn't have found
Song Zhichu's weakness.

00:14:16.792 --> 00:14:19.511
Besides, I promised to protect her.

00:14:19.512 --> 00:14:21.672
I cannot break my promise.

00:14:21.752 --> 00:14:23.031
Boss.

00:14:23.032 --> 00:14:24.599
Even a tiger won't eat its cub.

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:27.399
Otherwise, you could recognize
Song Ming as the father first.

00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:28.759
After all, Song Zhichu is dead.

00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:30.079
Maybe there's still a chance.

00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:31.272
Shut up!

00:14:34.352 --> 00:14:36.871
Don't mention this again.

00:14:36.872 --> 00:14:39.951
Especially in front of Liang Yi.

00:14:39.952 --> 00:14:42.991
I will never recognize him as my father.

00:14:42.992 --> 00:14:44.231
Next time you mention it,

00:14:44.232 --> 00:14:45.792
don't follow me.

00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:18.145
Is it good?

00:15:22.025 --> 00:15:23.431
You shrew.

00:15:23.432 --> 00:15:25.192
You actually gave birth to the child!

00:15:25.952 --> 00:15:27.271
You evil woman!

00:15:27.272 --> 00:15:29.432
Don't bully my mother!

00:15:32.075 --> 00:15:33.672
Yun, are you okay?

00:15:33.832 --> 00:15:35.952
Even a pot of abortion medicine
didn't kill you.

00:15:36.432 --> 00:15:39.671
Someone, beat this village woman

00:15:39.672 --> 00:15:41.072
and her son to death!

00:15:41.912 --> 00:15:43.311
Wait!

00:15:43.312 --> 00:15:44.431
Madam Song.

00:15:44.432 --> 00:15:46.151
You can do whatever to me.

00:15:46.152 --> 00:15:47.591
But I beg you,

00:15:47.592 --> 00:15:50.031
spare my son.

00:15:50.032 --> 00:15:51.431
Let him live.

00:15:51.432 --> 00:15:54.111
A child born from a servant
who slept with someone

00:15:54.112 --> 00:15:56.311
is a shame to the Song family.

00:15:56.312 --> 00:15:57.232
Hit them!

00:16:00.592 --> 00:16:01.992
Don't hit the child!

00:16:02.552 --> 00:16:06.232
Yun, don't be afraid, I am here.

00:16:11.912 --> 00:16:14.311
Mother!

00:16:14.312 --> 00:16:16.552
Wake up!

00:16:16.872 --> 00:16:18.511
Mother!

00:16:18.512 --> 00:16:20.932
Wake up!

00:16:21.337 --> 00:16:23.895
Mother!

00:16:35.337 --> 00:16:39.877
