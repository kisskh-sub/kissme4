PRO BONO

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:48.069
Arrest the sexual predator
Jang Hyeon-bae!

00:00:48.152 --> 00:00:50.113
-Arrest him!
-Arrest him!

00:00:50.196 --> 00:00:53.700
Bring sexual predator
Jang Hyeon-bae to justice!

00:00:53.783 --> 00:00:56.035
-Bring him to justice!
-Bring him to justice!

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.414
Despite allegations
of massive tax evasion and embezzlement,

00:00:59.497 --> 00:01:01.958
JS Group CEO Jang Hyeon-bae's
arrest warrant was dismissed,

00:01:02.041 --> 00:01:04.043
sparking controversy
about preferential treatment.

00:01:04.127 --> 00:01:06.671
All eyes will be on Judge Kang Da-wit

00:01:06.754 --> 00:01:08.923
as he delivers the verdict today.

00:01:09.757 --> 00:01:11.718
Meanwhile, Mr. Jang's legal team

00:01:11.801 --> 00:01:13.178
-claims his innocence--
-He's here!

00:01:13.261 --> 00:01:14.429
It's Judge Kang Da-wit!

00:01:14.512 --> 00:01:16.306
-Here he comes!
-He's here!

00:01:16.389 --> 00:01:17.515
ONE HUNDRED YEARS
OF SOLITUDE

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:26.691
Judge Kang,

00:01:26.774 --> 00:01:29.819
are you going to rule
on Mr. Jang's case as planned today?

00:01:31.362 --> 00:01:32.196
Judge Kang,

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.616
Jang's legal team
expressed confidence after recruiting

00:01:34.699 --> 00:01:36.409
a former justice of the Supreme Court.

00:01:36.492 --> 00:01:39.787
Justice Byeon was the chief judge
when you were first appointed.

00:01:39.871 --> 00:01:41.623
Have you been to Tongin Sundae-guk?

00:01:41.706 --> 00:01:42.999
Sundae?

00:01:43.082 --> 00:01:44.834
I know you like
blood sausage soup, Mr. Kim.

00:01:44.918 --> 00:01:49.130
Of the four major spots,
I think Tongin tastes the best.

00:01:49.213 --> 00:01:51.090
I'll treat you to it sometime. Wait.

00:01:51.174 --> 00:01:52.508
Ms. Park likes sundae too, right?

00:01:53.134 --> 00:01:54.469
You can come too.

00:01:55.303 --> 00:01:56.804
-Pardon?
-Judge Kang…

00:01:56.888 --> 00:01:57.931
Give us a few words!

00:01:58.014 --> 00:01:59.891
He sure is good at getting away.

00:01:59.974 --> 00:02:01.476
What's that in his hand?

00:02:01.559 --> 00:02:04.520
One Hundred Years of Solitude.
It's a Nobel Prize-winning novel.

00:02:04.604 --> 00:02:06.439
I know it's a novel. But…

00:02:06.981 --> 00:02:09.692
On a big day like this,
why did he bring a novel…

00:02:10.568 --> 00:02:11.402
"Hundred Years?"

00:02:11.945 --> 00:02:14.072
Is he going to sentence him
to 100 years in prison?

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.908
Come on, Do-hun!

00:02:16.991 --> 00:02:18.409
-What?
-Ridiculous.

00:02:19.077 --> 00:02:21.829
Seoul Central District Court,

00:02:21.913 --> 00:02:24.207
the biggest court in Korea,

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.211
handles 70%
of Seoul's civil and criminal cases.

00:02:28.294 --> 00:02:29.128
Hello, sir.

00:02:31.923 --> 00:02:34.092
Hey, Judge Kang. I'll see you later.

00:02:41.933 --> 00:02:43.351
COURT

00:02:43.434 --> 00:02:45.895
This is my castle,

00:02:46.771 --> 00:02:48.481
and not just anyone can come in.

00:02:52.277 --> 00:02:55.571
The Criminal Division
for Corruption Cases tries

00:02:55.655 --> 00:02:57.782
the most powerful people in the country.

00:02:57.865 --> 00:02:59.283
I've made it to this castle

00:03:00.118 --> 00:03:01.285
faster than anyone has.

00:03:02.495 --> 00:03:03.705
Hello.

00:03:04.664 --> 00:03:07.333
Captain! Hello, Judge Kang.

00:03:07.417 --> 00:03:08.251
Hello, sir!

00:03:08.334 --> 00:03:09.335
EPISODE 1

00:03:09.419 --> 00:03:10.962
How is your knee doing?

00:03:11.045 --> 00:03:13.172
It's no big deal.
It's just a mild sprain.

00:03:13.256 --> 00:03:15.883
Come on. You always say that.

00:03:15.967 --> 00:03:19.053
Teolbo's Butcher Shop is nearby.
Make sure to stop by later.

00:03:19.137 --> 00:03:20.555
Why?

00:03:20.638 --> 00:03:23.850
Why? I've bought some ox knee
and leg bones for you.

00:03:23.933 --> 00:03:26.602
Simmer them long and slow
for some nice soup.

00:03:28.354 --> 00:03:29.188
Sir.

00:03:29.272 --> 00:03:31.149
Just make sure to heal up quickly.

00:03:31.232 --> 00:03:33.234
Without our star center back,

00:03:33.317 --> 00:03:35.111
our defense has been a mess these days.

00:03:35.194 --> 00:03:37.280
It's so wide open,
a truck could drive through it.

00:03:38.072 --> 00:03:40.283
I'll keep that in mind, Captain.

00:03:41.868 --> 00:03:42.702
Okay!

00:03:44.287 --> 00:03:46.748
-And as always…
-I'll lean a bit forward.

00:03:47.457 --> 00:03:50.460
Today's work selfie!

00:03:50.543 --> 00:03:52.211
127K FOLLOWERS

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:54.589
Good morning, sir.

00:03:55.173 --> 00:03:56.841
Did your grandmother get a hospital room?

00:03:56.924 --> 00:03:59.635
No, not yet. They're all full.

00:04:00.219 --> 00:04:02.847
Mention me to Sejin University Hospital's
chief administrator.

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:04.307
They'll get you a VIP room.

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:05.850
Sir!

00:04:05.933 --> 00:04:08.186
You said your grandmother raised you.

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:11.731
She'll get better, so don't worry.
I'll leave him a text right now.

00:04:11.814 --> 00:04:13.524
Thank you so much, sir.

00:04:16.986 --> 00:04:18.196
Right.

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:20.323
-Don't worry about the fee.
-Sir?

00:04:21.115 --> 00:04:22.033
You'll see.

00:04:23.785 --> 00:04:25.370
Thank you!

00:04:26.329 --> 00:04:27.372
CHIEF JUDGE
KANG DA-WIT

00:04:28.956 --> 00:04:30.083
Come in.

00:04:31.751 --> 00:04:33.628
Shall we get going, sir?

00:04:35.171 --> 00:04:36.089
Let's go.

00:04:44.972 --> 00:04:47.266
Chaebols, or family-run conglomerates,
former presidents,

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:49.102
government ministers,
and assembly members.

00:04:49.185 --> 00:04:52.647
The authorities
who aren't afraid of anything

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:53.898
still tremble with fear

00:04:53.981 --> 00:04:56.692
when they lie on an operating table
or stand before the court.

00:04:56.776 --> 00:04:59.195
-Justice Byeon.
-Yes, Mr. Jang?

00:04:59.779 --> 00:05:01.614
Are you sure everything will be all right?

00:05:01.697 --> 00:05:03.574
Don't worry about it, sir.

00:05:03.658 --> 00:05:05.326
It's already been settled.

00:05:06.577 --> 00:05:07.412
Yes.

00:05:08.538 --> 00:05:11.040
This is that kind of place.

00:05:11.124 --> 00:05:13.418
All rise.

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:15.753
And I…

00:05:21.467 --> 00:05:22.385
am the king…

00:05:24.053 --> 00:05:25.054
of this place.

00:05:28.724 --> 00:05:31.269
Please be seated.

00:05:34.355 --> 00:05:35.231
Your Honor,

00:05:35.898 --> 00:05:40.111
we've filed a motion
to postpone sentencing.

00:05:40.194 --> 00:05:42.613
Yes. I've read through it thoroughly.

00:05:42.697 --> 00:05:46.117
You need more time again
to reach an agreement?

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.119
Yes. As you already know,

00:05:48.202 --> 00:05:51.289
the entire embezzled amount
has been returned to the company.

00:05:51.372 --> 00:05:53.082
And the outstanding taxes
have been repaid.

00:05:53.166 --> 00:05:56.627
But some parts of the agreement
are still in progress,

00:05:56.711 --> 00:05:57.795
so we need more time.

00:05:57.879 --> 00:06:00.047
Do those parts in progress involve

00:06:00.131 --> 00:06:03.634
the verbal and physical abuse
against his young secretaries…

00:06:05.636 --> 00:06:08.639
and the sexual assault
against his housekeepers?

00:06:08.723 --> 00:06:10.892
DEFENDANT

00:06:10.975 --> 00:06:12.185
Regarding those matters,

00:06:12.268 --> 00:06:15.271
they were largely misunderstandings.

00:06:15.354 --> 00:06:18.608
But for the greater good,

00:06:18.691 --> 00:06:21.194
I've acknowledged them as my shortcomings

00:06:21.277 --> 00:06:24.238
and we've agreed to a settlement,
Your Honor.

00:06:24.906 --> 00:06:25.907
A settlement?

00:06:26.741 --> 00:06:27.617
That's important.

00:06:28.201 --> 00:06:31.412
Well then, how much more time do you need?

00:06:31.495 --> 00:06:34.498
We're almost done settling
with the employees.

00:06:34.582 --> 00:06:38.336
And we have the two housekeepers left,

00:06:38.419 --> 00:06:40.213
so if you could grant us three more weeks…

00:06:40.296 --> 00:06:41.631
Three weeks?

00:06:41.714 --> 00:06:42.798
I mean…

00:06:45.259 --> 00:06:46.719
Three weeks? Really?

00:06:46.802 --> 00:06:48.346
Will that be enough?

00:06:48.429 --> 00:06:50.181
Pardon? Well…

00:06:50.264 --> 00:06:51.891
It's only two people.

00:06:51.974 --> 00:06:54.602
Gosh, you're so funny as well.

00:06:54.685 --> 00:06:57.480
How many victims were there?
Please put it up on the monitor.

00:06:59.523 --> 00:07:01.859
The defendant allocated projects
mainly to his family

00:07:01.943 --> 00:07:05.529
and pocketed the company's money
to buy a building in Manhattan

00:07:05.613 --> 00:07:07.031
and a winery in Napa Valley.

00:07:08.407 --> 00:07:10.576
You've been busy
looking for land to purchase.

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:12.578
Meanwhile, 800 employees were laid off

00:07:12.662 --> 00:07:14.830
under the pretext of voluntary retirement.

00:07:14.914 --> 00:07:17.542
If you count their family members,
that's 2,500.

00:07:17.625 --> 00:07:18.459
Your Honor--

00:07:18.543 --> 00:07:21.504
After trusting numbers fabricated
by fraudulent accounting

00:07:21.587 --> 00:07:23.339
and investing in the company,

00:07:23.422 --> 00:07:26.384
small retail investors
saw their lives ruined

00:07:26.467 --> 00:07:28.427
as stock prices plummeted,

00:07:28.511 --> 00:07:32.014
and their number alone makes up 24,000!

00:07:32.098 --> 00:07:34.100
-Your Honor.
-Please sit down.

00:07:34.934 --> 00:07:36.435
I'm not done yet.

00:07:38.145 --> 00:07:40.565
After evading
tens of billions of won in tax,

00:07:40.648 --> 00:07:43.985
you've dragged this trial on
with all sorts of lobbying

00:07:44.068 --> 00:07:46.904
and haven't coughed up
even a penny in tax for five years

00:07:46.988 --> 00:07:50.283
while there are tens of millions
of salary workers out there

00:07:50.366 --> 00:07:53.327
being levied income tax every month!

00:07:53.411 --> 00:07:54.620
If that wasn't enough,

00:07:54.704 --> 00:07:58.124
you've verbally and physically abused
your employees habitually.

00:07:58.207 --> 00:08:00.084
And you sexually assaulted
your housekeepers

00:08:00.167 --> 00:08:02.712
who are trying to make ends meet
and raise their children.

00:08:02.795 --> 00:08:05.464
After watching this on the news every day,

00:08:05.548 --> 00:08:06.924
the number of Korean citizens

00:08:07.008 --> 00:08:11.762
who are enraged and hate living here
makes up 50 million!

00:08:25.985 --> 00:08:29.447
How are you going
to settle the compensation

00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:32.074
for all of their mental suffering?

00:08:35.286 --> 00:08:37.580
Three weeks? Will that really be enough?

00:08:40.416 --> 00:08:44.587
The Court dismisses the defendant's motion
to postpone sentencing.

00:08:45.796 --> 00:08:49.258
The Court hereby renders
the following judgment.

00:08:50.009 --> 00:08:54.347
The defendant is sentenced
to ten years in prison

00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:57.558
and a fine of 70 billion won.

00:09:04.857 --> 00:09:06.776
Order in the court.

00:09:06.859 --> 00:09:08.235
Due to a risk of flight,

00:09:08.319 --> 00:09:10.821
the defendant will hereby
be taken into custody.

00:09:10.905 --> 00:09:13.449
Shall the Court
notify your spouse about this?

00:09:13.532 --> 00:09:14.450
Right.

00:09:15.785 --> 00:09:17.286
Which one should we notify?

00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:19.288
Your legal spouse? Or…

00:09:20.873 --> 00:09:21.999
the one you live with?

00:09:23.709 --> 00:09:25.002
Well…

00:09:26.796 --> 00:09:28.381
Anyone will do.

00:09:28.464 --> 00:09:30.091
All right, then.

00:09:31.717 --> 00:09:32.802
Please take him away.

00:09:32.885 --> 00:09:34.053
You bastard!

00:09:34.136 --> 00:09:35.096
I'm sorry.

00:09:35.179 --> 00:09:36.180
I'm sorry, sir.

00:09:38.182 --> 00:09:42.019
Do you think I'll take this lying down?

00:09:50.528 --> 00:09:53.989
The first anti-corruption judge
with only a high school degree,

00:09:54.073 --> 00:09:56.575
Chief Judge Kang Da-wit
of the Seoul Central District Court,

00:09:56.659 --> 00:09:58.744
-levied a harsher sentence…
-Over 310,000.

00:09:58.828 --> 00:10:01.539
than anyone anticipated
on JS Group CEO Jang Hyeon-bae

00:10:01.622 --> 00:10:04.208
and has instantly become
the people's judge.

00:10:04.291 --> 00:10:07.169
The book he was holding
on his way to court,

00:10:07.253 --> 00:10:08.754
One Hundred Years of Solitude,

00:10:09.338 --> 00:10:13.008
has raised a lot of speculation
regarding its significance.

00:10:13.092 --> 00:10:15.594
But the meaning
might be in the title itself.

00:10:15.678 --> 00:10:19.390
It symbolizes his solitary resolve
to stick to his principles

00:10:19.473 --> 00:10:22.309
and deliver a sentence without giving in
to any external pressure.

00:10:22.393 --> 00:10:24.478
That is the prevailing view.

00:10:24.562 --> 00:10:27.648
Meanwhile, the victims
that have long suffered…

00:10:29.316 --> 00:10:33.446
I'm your entertainer

00:10:33.529 --> 00:10:37.074
-I'm your…
-I'm your…

00:10:37.158 --> 00:10:39.201
People's judge!

00:10:49.378 --> 00:10:50.379
Sir.

00:10:51.881 --> 00:10:55.009
Who's playing such loud music
in the courthouse?

00:10:55.092 --> 00:10:56.552
Yes, Ms. Yoon?

00:10:56.635 --> 00:10:58.304
How did it go with your grandmother?

00:11:00.055 --> 00:11:02.016
We got her a hospital room.

00:11:02.099 --> 00:11:04.393
-Good.
-It's all thanks to you, sir.

00:11:04.477 --> 00:11:06.228
Thank you so much.

00:11:06.312 --> 00:11:07.438
Gosh, no need to thank me.

00:11:07.521 --> 00:11:10.691
Who's going to help
the members of my team if I don't?

00:11:15.404 --> 00:11:17.239
-Also, sir…
-Yes?

00:11:17.323 --> 00:11:19.074
You were awesome today!

00:11:19.158 --> 00:11:21.785
Court employees
from all over the country called me,

00:11:21.869 --> 00:11:24.580
and they went on and on
about how cool you were!

00:11:24.663 --> 00:11:27.750
Geez, it was just another case.

00:11:27.833 --> 00:11:32.463
A judge just does his job quietly
according to law and principle.

00:11:32.546 --> 00:11:34.006
What's so special about that?

00:11:35.549 --> 00:11:36.634
Come on.

00:11:37.676 --> 00:11:40.596
Your modesty makes you even cooler.

00:11:41.931 --> 00:11:43.474
-Sir.
-Yes?

00:11:43.557 --> 00:11:44.850
Actually, I'm a member

00:11:44.934 --> 00:11:46.852
of Seoul's Justice Nomination Committee

00:11:46.936 --> 00:11:49.146
in the Court Employees' Union.

00:11:49.813 --> 00:11:52.107
Really? My goodness.

00:11:52.191 --> 00:11:55.402
I had absolutely no idea.
That's so surprising.

00:11:55.486 --> 00:11:57.947
I'm going to vote
to nominate you as our candidate

00:11:58.030 --> 00:11:59.865
-for Supreme Court Justice.
-Gosh.

00:11:59.949 --> 00:12:02.826
Everyone says you'll help
the younger generation be heard

00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:05.829
and improve the working environment
at the Supreme Court.

00:12:05.913 --> 00:12:08.624
Even your good looks
would be a benefit to employees!

00:12:08.707 --> 00:12:10.751
Goodness, I'm still too young.

00:12:10.834 --> 00:12:12.795
And I lack the competence and experience.

00:12:12.878 --> 00:12:15.965
It's not like I work as a judge
just to be successful either.

00:12:16.048 --> 00:12:18.342
Well, I knew you'd turn it down

00:12:18.425 --> 00:12:20.553
since you are so modest.

00:12:20.636 --> 00:12:22.513
Do you need my resident registration?

00:12:22.596 --> 00:12:24.974
You'll need to attach it
to the letter of recommendation.

00:12:25.683 --> 00:12:26.642
What's this?

00:12:26.725 --> 00:12:28.644
I happened to have a copy of it.

00:12:29.144 --> 00:12:30.062
Okay.

00:12:30.646 --> 00:12:33.065
I'll submit it. Thank you.

00:12:33.899 --> 00:12:35.025
Have a good day.

00:12:40.239 --> 00:12:41.615
That was the first step.

00:12:41.699 --> 00:12:44.535
Anyone can recommend
a Supreme Court Justice candidate.

00:12:44.618 --> 00:12:46.745
After a screening process,

00:12:46.829 --> 00:12:51.125
the committee nominates three times
as many people to the Chief Justice.

00:12:51.208 --> 00:12:54.628
The Chief Justice chooses one among them
and recommends them to the President.

00:12:54.712 --> 00:12:57.923
Step one is to get nominated
by the Court Employees' Union.

00:12:58.007 --> 00:12:59.425
Not bad.

00:13:00.175 --> 00:13:03.596
I've worked my way up from the bottom,
which makes for a good story.

00:13:04.471 --> 00:13:07.975
During a presidential election
in the past,

00:13:08.058 --> 00:13:10.311
some believed a candidate
in their forties was needed.

00:13:10.394 --> 00:13:13.439
I think it's about time for the court

00:13:13.522 --> 00:13:18.819
to have a young and bright justice
instead of an elderly one.

00:13:18.902 --> 00:13:21.530
He's from outside of Seoul
and only has a high school diploma.

00:13:21.614 --> 00:13:23.782
He understands the common people.

00:13:23.866 --> 00:13:28.078
If we don't support someone like him,
who else would we support, my friends?

00:13:28.162 --> 00:13:29.496
-Right.
-Yeah.

00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:30.706
By the way, sir.

00:13:30.789 --> 00:13:34.209
Something's been simmering
back there for a while now.

00:13:34.293 --> 00:13:35.294
You're right.

00:13:35.919 --> 00:13:38.547
It smells good.
What have you been cooking?

00:13:38.631 --> 00:13:40.674
This? It's nothing.

00:13:41.258 --> 00:13:43.093
It's ox knee and leg bone soup.

00:13:43.177 --> 00:13:45.220
I have a pretty bad knee.

00:13:48.432 --> 00:13:50.059
What an honor!

00:13:50.643 --> 00:13:52.561
I get to pour a drink

00:13:52.645 --> 00:13:53.854
for the people's judge.

00:13:53.937 --> 00:13:54.980
My goodness.

00:13:55.648 --> 00:13:58.108
Please forgive me, sir.

00:13:58.192 --> 00:13:59.443
SENIOR CHIEF JUDGE, CRIMINAL

00:13:59.526 --> 00:14:02.655
-My apologies for causing trouble.
-Come on, don't say that.

00:14:02.738 --> 00:14:05.449
You can't be sorry
if the court panel ruled

00:14:05.532 --> 00:14:07.743
based on its own conviction.

00:14:07.826 --> 00:14:11.955
Some might mistake us
for interfering with the trial.

00:14:12.915 --> 00:14:14.208
-Judge Kang.
-Yes, sir?

00:14:14.291 --> 00:14:16.085
I thought you were
easy-going and sensible.

00:14:16.168 --> 00:14:17.503
SENIOR CHIEF JUDGE, CIVIL AFFAIRS

00:14:17.586 --> 00:14:20.047
But I guess you had
lots of pent-up things inside.

00:14:20.130 --> 00:14:21.423
Not at all, sir.

00:14:21.507 --> 00:14:22.925
Stop. It was because he's young.

00:14:23.008 --> 00:14:25.219
SHIN JUNG-SEOK
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT COURT CHIEF

00:14:25.302 --> 00:14:27.805
A young judge
should be passionate like him.

00:14:28.472 --> 00:14:30.557
Also, it was only the first hearing.

00:14:30.641 --> 00:14:33.268
It'll go to the appellate court.

00:14:34.228 --> 00:14:38.065
The business world is going nuts
because the media made such a fuss.

00:14:38.148 --> 00:14:40.859
I'm worried about
how the Blue House will respond.

00:14:40.943 --> 00:14:45.239
Mr. Shin, this is why I said
the Division for Corruption Cases

00:14:45.322 --> 00:14:47.491
should be handled by someone we can trust

00:14:47.574 --> 00:14:49.076
from National Court Administration.

00:14:49.702 --> 00:14:53.163
Even though the recent trend
is to break hierarchies--

00:14:53.247 --> 00:14:54.623
Then, are you saying…

00:14:55.582 --> 00:14:57.251
I appointed the wrong person?

00:14:59.628 --> 00:15:00.879
My apologies.

00:15:00.963 --> 00:15:02.965
No, I didn't mean that.

00:15:03.048 --> 00:15:04.842
No, sir!

00:15:04.925 --> 00:15:07.594
It's my fault.
I'm sorry for causing you trouble.

00:15:07.678 --> 00:15:09.430
Everyone, I apologize!

00:15:10.014 --> 00:15:11.056
Please tell me.

00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:14.977
They're the most elite aristocrats
in the legal world.

00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:16.437
-No, sir.
-What do you mean "No"?

00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:18.188
But since they're only bookworms,

00:15:18.272 --> 00:15:21.734
they don't understand
that politics is a living organism.

00:15:22.484 --> 00:15:24.570
It's tough serving the country, isn't it?

00:15:24.653 --> 00:15:26.905
These are herbal tonics. Take them.

00:15:28.073 --> 00:15:30.701
Serving the country?
I'm a mere aide to a National Assemblyman.

00:15:30.784 --> 00:15:33.871
Your boss is a political big shot though.

00:15:33.954 --> 00:15:34.830
It must be tough.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.419
It's been so rough these days.

00:15:41.128 --> 00:15:44.214
Incidents keep happening,
so the approval rating has cratered.

00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:47.551
We need something
to change the atmosphere.

00:15:49.344 --> 00:15:52.097
In any administration,
when the approval rating drops,

00:15:52.181 --> 00:15:55.267
they try to turn things around
by cracking down on chaebols.

00:15:55.350 --> 00:15:57.770
The whole country hates
Chairman Jang Hyeon-bae

00:15:57.853 --> 00:16:00.314
for habitually beating his staff.

00:16:00.397 --> 00:16:03.692
So what if the young judge
who got rid of Chairman Jang

00:16:03.776 --> 00:16:05.360
is also a justice candidate?

00:16:05.444 --> 00:16:07.988
He'd be a good card to play.

00:16:08.072 --> 00:16:11.283
A shocking appointment
who understands the minds of the youth.

00:16:11.366 --> 00:16:14.620
Judge Kang, what are you waiting for?
Hurry up and do it.

00:16:14.703 --> 00:16:15.954
Yes, sir.

00:16:16.038 --> 00:16:18.040
I am at your service.

00:16:19.792 --> 00:16:21.126
I pledge my loyalty!

00:16:23.629 --> 00:16:25.380
That's what I'm talking about.

00:16:26.965 --> 00:16:28.926
Yes!

00:16:29.009 --> 00:16:31.512
You normally behave so well.

00:16:31.595 --> 00:16:34.223
Why did you suddenly go overboard?

00:16:34.306 --> 00:16:36.100
Hey, stop it already.

00:16:36.183 --> 00:16:37.059
Judge Kang is…

00:16:38.602 --> 00:16:40.437
Is your forehead all right?

00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:44.441
Gochujang!

00:16:45.651 --> 00:16:47.486
It's red chili paste.

00:16:48.153 --> 00:16:49.571
To dip snacks in.

00:16:50.572 --> 00:16:51.406
It's salty.

00:16:51.490 --> 00:16:52.866
Geez, this guy!

00:16:52.950 --> 00:16:56.161
You're not like other judges.

00:16:56.245 --> 00:16:58.372
You're young, yet you try so hard.

00:16:59.081 --> 00:17:01.083
But don't try too hard.

00:17:01.708 --> 00:17:03.627
It's a bit uncomfortable

00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:06.296
when someone is too tenacious.

00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:07.965
-Come on.
-I'm kidding!

00:17:08.048 --> 00:17:09.550
Yes, sir.

00:17:09.633 --> 00:17:10.843
Let's drink to that.

00:17:10.926 --> 00:17:11.969
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

00:17:12.052 --> 00:17:13.387
Cheers.

00:17:15.222 --> 00:17:18.100
"Don't try too hard"?

00:17:18.183 --> 00:17:19.643
How ridiculous.

00:17:19.726 --> 00:17:22.729
Those who have worked as hard as I have
can look down on me.

00:17:22.813 --> 00:17:25.107
But you guys can't.

00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:27.818
Never.

00:17:32.364 --> 00:17:33.490
It's Judge Kang!

00:17:37.035 --> 00:17:37.870
Judge Kang!

00:17:37.953 --> 00:17:40.956
-Sir, a few words!
-Please give us a few words!

00:17:41.915 --> 00:17:45.043
Judge Kang, give us a few words.
Was there external pressure?

00:17:47.421 --> 00:17:50.883
Sir, what do you think of your nickname,
"The People's Judge"?

00:17:50.966 --> 00:17:52.259
Right.

00:17:52.342 --> 00:17:54.094
I'm sorry. As you can see,

00:17:54.178 --> 00:17:56.096
I have so many cases to catch up on.

00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:58.056
Hello, Ms. Park.

00:18:03.687 --> 00:18:05.355
Sorry!

00:18:12.279 --> 00:18:14.865
-Kang Da-wit, the people's judge.
-Geez.

00:18:14.948 --> 00:18:16.158
Mr. Kim.

00:18:16.742 --> 00:18:18.994
They say you'll be
the next justice candidate.

00:18:19.077 --> 00:18:21.496
Come on. I'm still too young.

00:18:21.580 --> 00:18:22.664
Right?

00:18:22.748 --> 00:18:25.292
A justice in his forties
is a bit irrational--

00:18:25.375 --> 00:18:28.086
Emmanuel Macron,
President of France, age 39.

00:18:28.170 --> 00:18:30.172
Rishi Sunak,
Prime Minister of England, age 42.

00:18:30.255 --> 00:18:32.299
Former Korean Justice Go Jae-ho, age 41.

00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:35.886
These are the ages
of when they were appointed.

00:18:36.678 --> 00:18:40.390
Kang Da-wit, born in 1981.

00:18:45.854 --> 00:18:47.731
You're well-prepared, Judge Kang.

00:18:49.566 --> 00:18:50.692
Good morning.

00:18:50.776 --> 00:18:51.818
Good morning, sir.

00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:59.326
Why do you keep carrying around
old documents we're going to shred?

00:19:00.035 --> 00:19:00.911
What?

00:19:01.787 --> 00:19:03.455
To work out.

00:19:32.234 --> 00:19:34.111
For goodness' sake!

00:19:34.194 --> 00:19:36.405
Seriously? Damn it.

00:19:36.488 --> 00:19:37.739
Geez.

00:19:39.992 --> 00:19:41.076
NOMINATE A FUTURE JUSTICE

00:19:41.159 --> 00:19:44.204
Oh, dear! What are we going to do?

00:19:44.288 --> 00:19:47.332
It must have taken so long
to get these ready.

00:19:47.416 --> 00:19:48.709
Are you all right?

00:19:48.792 --> 00:19:50.627
Yes. Thank you.

00:19:50.711 --> 00:19:52.838
Goodness. You must be new.

00:19:52.921 --> 00:19:55.007
Your senior colleagues
make you copy a lot of stuff?

00:19:55.090 --> 00:19:56.967
What? No, that's not it.

00:19:57.050 --> 00:19:59.052
I know. You don't have to explain.

00:19:59.136 --> 00:20:01.555
Goodness, there's a lot.

00:20:01.638 --> 00:20:03.515
You can't copy all these alone.

00:20:05.392 --> 00:20:06.560
-Gosh.
-No, it's okay!

00:20:06.643 --> 00:20:07.769
I'll do it.

00:20:07.853 --> 00:20:09.479
-I feel so bad.
-Don't be.

00:20:09.563 --> 00:20:11.648
Your job is my job.

00:20:11.732 --> 00:20:14.234
We're all one big family here,
aren't we?

00:20:15.193 --> 00:20:16.028
"Family"?

00:20:18.363 --> 00:20:19.573
Yes. Sure.

00:20:19.656 --> 00:20:21.491
Thank you.

00:20:26.663 --> 00:20:29.833
I'm sorry, but by any chance,

00:20:29.916 --> 00:20:32.044
could you take these papers down for me?

00:20:34.755 --> 00:20:35.589
Papers?

00:20:36.590 --> 00:20:38.967
They weren't kidding
about Gen Z being something else.

00:20:39.051 --> 00:20:42.262
A bottom-tier newbie
asking a chief judge for papers?

00:20:42.346 --> 00:20:44.931
Once I become a justice, I'm going to--

00:20:45.015 --> 00:20:46.224
Of course, I can!

00:20:46.850 --> 00:20:48.101
All right. So…

00:20:48.769 --> 00:20:50.729
It's hard to take them down at first.

00:20:50.812 --> 00:20:52.356
You could hurt your back too.

00:20:56.902 --> 00:20:59.404
That badge. Are you an attorney?

00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:01.156
Yes.

00:21:02.574 --> 00:21:03.742
Come on.

00:21:04.534 --> 00:21:06.578
You should've told me that right away.

00:21:08.288 --> 00:21:11.875
I thought you were a court employee here

00:21:11.958 --> 00:21:13.502
who had a vote.

00:21:13.585 --> 00:21:14.628
Sorry?

00:21:14.711 --> 00:21:16.171
A vote?

00:21:16.254 --> 00:21:17.631
What are you talking about?

00:21:17.714 --> 00:21:19.299
They should have sent an employee.

00:21:19.383 --> 00:21:23.136
Why is an attorney making copies here?
How confusing.

00:21:25.430 --> 00:21:27.349
I can't believe that old man.

00:21:30.811 --> 00:21:33.105
-"Old man"?
-Yes. You're not an old lady, are you?

00:21:33.188 --> 00:21:34.439
-What?
-What?

00:21:34.523 --> 00:21:35.649
-You--
-What?

00:21:38.026 --> 00:21:38.944
Yes.

00:21:39.528 --> 00:21:41.947
I'm a public interest attorney
without any assistants,

00:21:42.572 --> 00:21:45.617
so I do everything myself.

00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:46.910
Was asking you

00:21:46.993 --> 00:21:50.622
to take down those papers for me
that much of a terrible thing to do?

00:21:50.705 --> 00:21:52.457
What did you say?

00:21:53.125 --> 00:21:54.251
You said you're an attorney.

00:21:54.334 --> 00:21:57.087
Don't you know who you're talking to?

00:21:57.170 --> 00:22:00.132
Why do I have to know who you are?

00:22:01.091 --> 00:22:03.844
Don't you own a TV or watch the news?

00:22:03.927 --> 00:22:06.763
You must have no interest
in what goes on in the world.

00:22:09.015 --> 00:22:11.435
-This old man must be a narcissist.
-What?

00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:13.854
You can go back on your way.

00:22:14.855 --> 00:22:16.231
Are you that important?

00:22:16.314 --> 00:22:17.941
I can't believe her. Yes.

00:22:18.024 --> 00:22:19.484
-I am a big deal--
-Judge Kang.

00:22:19.568 --> 00:22:20.694
Have you eaten yet?

00:22:20.777 --> 00:22:23.363
Okay. I think we're good now.

00:22:24.781 --> 00:22:26.324
This machine's old,

00:22:27.659 --> 00:22:30.203
so sometimes, you have to
give it a smack for it to work.

00:22:31.371 --> 00:22:32.372
Goodbye, then.

00:22:33.039 --> 00:22:35.125
-Did you go to Tongin Sundae-guk?
-We did.

00:22:36.126 --> 00:22:37.210
He's so sweet.

00:22:42.465 --> 00:22:44.426
A public interest attorney, my foot.

00:22:44.509 --> 00:22:47.053
Her job doesn't even make money,
so why is she so arrogant?

00:22:47.137 --> 00:22:48.847
Who knows if she can even afford a living?

00:23:09.409 --> 00:23:10.452
TEXT MESSAGE

00:23:17.876 --> 00:23:21.296
The Court Employees' Union
has nominated you

00:23:21.379 --> 00:23:23.340
as their justice candidate.

00:23:39.439 --> 00:23:40.565
Hello, sir.

00:23:40.649 --> 00:23:43.193
We heard you were nominated
as a justice candidate.

00:23:43.276 --> 00:23:45.362
Are you going to accept
the screening process?

00:23:45.445 --> 00:23:47.489
-Well…
-Sir, could we have a quick interview?

00:23:47.572 --> 00:23:48.657
How do you feel?

00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:49.658
-Ms. Park.
-Yes?

00:23:49.741 --> 00:23:51.076
Do you like chocolates?

00:23:51.159 --> 00:23:52.994
Sorry? Why do you suddenly ask?

00:23:53.078 --> 00:23:57.082
There's a famous quote
from a movie I like, Forrest Gump.

00:23:57.165 --> 00:23:59.417
"My momma always said…"

00:24:04.923 --> 00:24:07.133
Right. But what does that mean?

00:24:10.011 --> 00:24:11.388
I don't know either.

00:24:11.471 --> 00:24:12.555
What does that mean?

00:24:12.639 --> 00:24:15.517
-Sorry?
-Gosh, what a difficult line.

00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:18.687
Sir, so are you consenting
to the screening process?

00:24:20.438 --> 00:24:22.023
-Please tell us.
-Are you consenting?

00:24:22.816 --> 00:24:23.942
What was that?

00:24:25.610 --> 00:24:28.071
Why did he speak
in bad English like a politician?

00:24:28.154 --> 00:24:30.532
Maybe he meant, "Nobody knows the future"?

00:24:31.366 --> 00:24:34.452
"Get…" He must have gotten it.

00:24:36.746 --> 00:24:39.624
He must have the spot.
He must've agreed to the process.

00:24:39.708 --> 00:24:40.542
I see.

00:25:09.070 --> 00:25:11.698
I'm almost there, Mom.

00:25:37.724 --> 00:25:38.808
Da-wit!

00:25:40.602 --> 00:25:41.436
Mom!

00:25:42.062 --> 00:25:44.022
Mom, was working
at the factory tough today?

00:25:44.105 --> 00:25:46.149
Nope, it wasn't.

00:25:46.900 --> 00:25:49.652
-How's your lower back?
-It's fine.

00:25:49.736 --> 00:25:50.653
Here.

00:25:52.530 --> 00:25:53.448
It's a gift.

00:25:56.785 --> 00:25:58.119
Gosh, this…

00:25:58.828 --> 00:26:00.663
It's my favorite gift.

00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:08.463
It's so sour.

00:26:10.298 --> 00:26:13.051
Why do you like it so much
when it's so sour?

00:26:14.052 --> 00:26:17.430
Life can be pretty sour and bitter

00:26:17.972 --> 00:26:20.600
instead of being sweet.

00:26:22.018 --> 00:26:24.062
You'll understand once you grow up.

00:26:24.145 --> 00:26:27.190
What should we make for dinner?

00:26:27.273 --> 00:26:29.109
-I don't know.
-What do you want?

00:26:29.734 --> 00:26:31.403
-Spicy stir-fried pork.
-Really?

00:26:31.486 --> 00:26:32.487
-Yeah.
-Okay.

00:26:33.655 --> 00:26:35.740
LATE SUMMER OF 1998

00:26:39.327 --> 00:26:40.495
-Have a good day.
-Hello.

00:26:40.578 --> 00:26:42.414
Gosh, Da-wit's here.

00:26:42.497 --> 00:26:44.249
Dorm life is tough, isn't it?

00:26:44.332 --> 00:26:47.377
Studying's not so bad.
Mom has it tougher.

00:26:49.671 --> 00:26:52.257
-Do you have any apricots?
-Apricots?

00:26:52.340 --> 00:26:54.801
The season for them is in June.
It's too late now.

00:26:54.884 --> 00:26:57.011
Persimmons are sweet and tasty these days.

00:26:57.846 --> 00:27:01.349
But I want apricots instead.
I want the sour ones, not the sweet ones.

00:27:02.767 --> 00:27:03.893
Mom, I'm home.

00:27:07.689 --> 00:27:08.648
Mom?

00:27:10.525 --> 00:27:11.484
Mom?

00:27:18.491 --> 00:27:19.325
Mom?

00:27:21.744 --> 00:27:22.620
Mom.

00:27:23.246 --> 00:27:24.080
Mom!

00:27:24.622 --> 00:27:25.457
Mom!

00:27:26.124 --> 00:27:27.876
Mom, look at me.

00:27:27.959 --> 00:27:29.252
Mom, what's wrong?

00:27:29.794 --> 00:27:30.712
Mom!

00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:34.257
Mom!

00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:50.773
Man, it's sweet.

00:27:51.649 --> 00:27:53.568
These expensive department store apricots…

00:27:54.486 --> 00:27:57.155
aren't sour or bitter, Mom.

00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:03.036
They're sweet.

00:28:04.162 --> 00:28:05.079
Very sweet.

00:28:08.333 --> 00:28:09.876
COURT

00:28:09.959 --> 00:28:10.835
Good morning!

00:28:11.544 --> 00:28:13.796
Sir, have you agreed
to the screening process?

00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:15.673
It's an honor just to be nominated,

00:28:15.757 --> 00:28:16.841
but I have no ambitions.

00:28:16.925 --> 00:28:19.469
What? Please have some!

00:28:19.552 --> 00:28:22.388
Everything's great about you,
but your lack of ambition's a flaw.

00:28:23.223 --> 00:28:24.432
At the Supreme Court,

00:28:24.516 --> 00:28:27.894
I won't get to work with you anymore.
That's sad.

00:28:27.977 --> 00:28:29.312
You can take me with you.

00:28:29.395 --> 00:28:31.940
Please promote me
to be a justice's secretary.

00:28:32.732 --> 00:28:36.402
Ms. Yoon.
You're ambitious. That's charming.

00:28:36.486 --> 00:28:37.529
I believe in you, sir.

00:28:37.612 --> 00:28:41.616
Right. Your classmate
from elementary school called.

00:28:43.785 --> 00:28:45.829
"Kim Ju-seop"? Who's that?

00:28:46.579 --> 00:28:48.414
He said "Juvenile" would ring a bell.

00:28:48.498 --> 00:28:51.501
Juvenile? Kim… Juvenile?

00:28:52.961 --> 00:28:55.213
Right. Kim Juvenile.

00:28:55.839 --> 00:28:57.048
Why did that prick…

00:28:58.883 --> 00:29:00.844
What did he suddenly call?

00:29:01.594 --> 00:29:03.388
Last time I saw him
was in elementary school.

00:29:06.266 --> 00:29:07.517
What?

00:29:08.226 --> 00:29:11.521
Hey, Juvenile!
Running an orchard must be tough.

00:29:11.604 --> 00:29:14.649
Look how tanned you are.

00:29:15.859 --> 00:29:17.485
Hey, when I was young,

00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:21.614
I thought your family
was the richest in the world.

00:29:21.698 --> 00:29:24.826
Come on. My orchard isn't even that big.

00:29:25.493 --> 00:29:27.537
-You're the amazing one.
-Come on.

00:29:28.121 --> 00:29:30.164
Hey, let's cut the chitchat.

00:29:31.833 --> 00:29:35.003
-Just sign 100 autographs for me.
-Gosh, will you stop?

00:29:35.086 --> 00:29:37.964
I'm here to get your autograph
on behalf of our hometown.

00:29:38.047 --> 00:29:41.551
Who signs an autograph for a friend?
Come on. It's embarrassing.

00:29:41.634 --> 00:29:44.470
-Stop complaining and do it.
-No.

00:29:45.346 --> 00:29:46.180
No?

00:29:47.599 --> 00:29:50.935
For autographs,
this brush pen works the best.

00:29:53.730 --> 00:29:55.607
You carry around brush pens too?

00:30:00.028 --> 00:30:01.237
-Da-wit.
-Yeah?

00:30:01.321 --> 00:30:02.238
THE PEOPLE'S JUDGE

00:30:02.322 --> 00:30:04.741
You really are something else.

00:30:04.824 --> 00:30:07.535
You had such a hard life
growing up in the countryside.

00:30:07.619 --> 00:30:09.245
Now, you've become so successful.

00:30:09.871 --> 00:30:12.040
-I don't know my place, do I?
-What?

00:30:12.916 --> 00:30:14.542
Come on. Don't be ridiculous!

00:30:14.626 --> 00:30:15.877
I shouldn't have mentioned it.

00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:17.045
Forget it.

00:30:17.128 --> 00:30:18.630
-Anyways…
-Yeah.

00:30:19.464 --> 00:30:22.508
Do you remember Ji-min?

00:30:22.592 --> 00:30:23.426
Ji-min?

00:30:25.762 --> 00:30:26.804
Do you mean Bang Ji-min?

00:30:27.513 --> 00:30:28.890
Yeah, your first love.

00:30:28.973 --> 00:30:30.767
Get out of here, you punk.

00:30:30.850 --> 00:30:32.560
She had a crush on me, but I didn't.

00:30:32.644 --> 00:30:35.063
-No, I wasn't into her.
-Is that so?

00:30:35.146 --> 00:30:39.442
You begged me to lend you 30,000 won
to buy her a birthday gift,

00:30:39.525 --> 00:30:42.028
and you still haven't paid me back.

00:30:42.654 --> 00:30:44.572
Gosh, I did?

00:30:46.574 --> 00:30:49.077
-What? You want it now?
-No, forget it!

00:30:50.787 --> 00:30:52.789
No, I want to send my friend off first.

00:30:52.872 --> 00:30:54.582
No, my designated driver is almost here.

00:30:54.666 --> 00:30:55.792
-Go on ahead.
-No, you go.

00:30:55.875 --> 00:30:57.210
-Go.
-You go first.

00:30:57.293 --> 00:31:00.964
-Hey, you go first.
-I told you to go first, you punk.

00:31:01.047 --> 00:31:03.174
Hey, what's that?

00:31:03.257 --> 00:31:04.425
-What?
-My goodness!

00:31:04.509 --> 00:31:05.718
Hey!

00:31:05.802 --> 00:31:07.387
Okay.

00:31:07.470 --> 00:31:08.429
Geez.

00:31:10.682 --> 00:31:11.599
Keep in touch.

00:31:11.683 --> 00:31:14.102
Yeah, let's keep in touch
from now on. Okay?

00:31:14.185 --> 00:31:17.772
Don't ignore your old friends
just because you're successful now.

00:31:17.855 --> 00:31:19.899
All right, already.

00:31:19.983 --> 00:31:21.859
Yeah. The people's judge!

00:31:21.943 --> 00:31:22.777
Good luck!

00:31:22.860 --> 00:31:26.572
Gosh, you're so juvenile. Geez.

00:31:26.656 --> 00:31:28.491
-I'll get going.
-All right.

00:31:28.574 --> 00:31:29.742
See you later.

00:31:32.078 --> 00:31:34.747
Sir, please drive safely.

00:31:48.302 --> 00:31:51.389
COURT

00:31:57.270 --> 00:31:59.981
Geez, Mr. Kim.

00:32:00.064 --> 00:32:02.316
Why are you out here so early?

00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:03.943
Judge Kang,

00:32:04.736 --> 00:32:06.404
it's about your sentencing last week

00:32:06.487 --> 00:32:08.364
of Jungbu Pharmaceuticals' Chairman Yoo.

00:32:08.448 --> 00:32:10.074
-Could you say--
-I have nothing to say.

00:32:10.158 --> 00:32:13.995
A judge only speaks through his rulings.

00:32:14.579 --> 00:32:16.789
Just answer one question for us.

00:32:16.873 --> 00:32:19.000
Right now, you're doing more interviews

00:32:19.083 --> 00:32:20.376
than anyone else in Korea.

00:32:21.294 --> 00:32:22.128
What is this?

00:32:22.211 --> 00:32:24.172
What? Is there something in your trunk?

00:32:24.255 --> 00:32:26.299
-Right!
-What?

00:32:26.382 --> 00:32:27.592
My underwear!

00:32:28.342 --> 00:32:31.012
I forgot to wash my underwear
after playing soccer this morning.

00:32:31.721 --> 00:32:33.431
-Where's the--
-No, it stinks!

00:32:33.514 --> 00:32:36.017
It stinks so bad…

00:32:36.100 --> 00:32:39.562
It smells like a dead body.
I should run to the laundromat!

00:32:40.730 --> 00:32:42.899
I'm going to the laundromat.
I better go.

00:32:42.982 --> 00:32:45.109
-The laundromat--
-I need to go to the laundromat!

00:32:45.860 --> 00:32:48.112
Please say something about the case.

00:32:48.738 --> 00:32:50.865
It can be short! Come on!

00:32:53.159 --> 00:32:55.495
He can be pretty strange sometimes.

00:32:55.578 --> 00:32:57.789
Why is he going to the laundromat?

00:33:04.670 --> 00:33:06.297
Was I mistaken?

00:33:06.380 --> 00:33:08.508
No, this can't be true.

00:33:08.591 --> 00:33:11.886
Is this a habit from work?
I can guess the amount from the box size.

00:33:11.969 --> 00:33:13.888
When filled with new 50,000-won bills,

00:33:13.971 --> 00:33:15.223
a briefcase is 300 million.

00:33:15.306 --> 00:33:17.892
A ramyeon box is 600 million.
An apple box is 1.2 billion.

00:33:17.975 --> 00:33:20.394
No, it can't be…

00:33:20.478 --> 00:33:22.396
Get a hold of yourself.

00:33:27.819 --> 00:33:30.238
At this crucial moment,
when I'm about to become a justice,

00:33:30.321 --> 00:33:33.199
there's 1.2 billion won
in cash in my trunk?

00:33:35.785 --> 00:33:37.120
There's no way.

00:33:37.912 --> 00:33:39.163
No way.

00:34:03.688 --> 00:34:04.939
Kang Da-wit.

00:34:06.149 --> 00:34:07.024
Who's that?

00:34:09.318 --> 00:34:10.153
You…

00:34:10.736 --> 00:34:12.029
are fucked.

00:34:13.781 --> 00:34:16.826
No!

00:34:21.789 --> 00:34:22.999
Why isn't he picking up?

00:34:24.625 --> 00:34:26.460
Think. Come on, think.

00:34:26.544 --> 00:34:28.754
They say clear minds
can help you survive even a bear.

00:34:30.173 --> 00:34:31.299
Or was it a tiger?

00:34:31.382 --> 00:34:33.509
No, that's not what's important right now.

00:34:34.510 --> 00:34:36.470
Hey, people's judge.

00:34:36.554 --> 00:34:38.514
I'm on my way back home now.

00:34:40.183 --> 00:34:41.601
Okay, at a time like this,

00:34:41.684 --> 00:34:43.811
I should check the facts first.

00:34:46.814 --> 00:34:48.733
Did you get back safely last night?

00:34:49.442 --> 00:34:53.029
Come on. You think this hillbilly
couldn't find his hotel?

00:34:53.946 --> 00:34:55.865
I was worried about you, dude.

00:34:55.948 --> 00:34:57.366
By the way,

00:34:58.326 --> 00:35:00.494
did you leave something in my car?

00:35:01.204 --> 00:35:03.372
What? What are you talking about?

00:35:03.456 --> 00:35:05.666
You and I left at the same time
after drinking.

00:35:06.334 --> 00:35:07.335
Right.

00:35:07.418 --> 00:35:09.212
Right? I know that.

00:35:09.295 --> 00:35:11.964
Hey, don't get me wrong,

00:35:12.590 --> 00:35:15.927
but you didn't have a favor to ask of me

00:35:16.594 --> 00:35:18.221
or anything like that, right?

00:35:19.430 --> 00:35:20.431
A favor?

00:35:20.514 --> 00:35:23.142
Of course, I have one.

00:35:23.226 --> 00:35:24.227
What is it?

00:35:25.311 --> 00:35:26.687
Well…

00:35:26.771 --> 00:35:28.189
Another 100 autographs.

00:35:28.814 --> 00:35:30.983
I'll use them to brag.

00:35:31.067 --> 00:35:32.985
"I'm Judge Kang's best friend."

00:35:33.069 --> 00:35:35.238
"I'm a big deal."

00:35:38.699 --> 00:35:39.867
Right. My autographs.

00:35:41.827 --> 00:35:43.788
Well, sure. That's no problem at all.

00:35:43.871 --> 00:35:47.208
Okay, then. Get home safe.
I'll see you next time.

00:35:49.335 --> 00:35:50.336
Right.

00:35:50.419 --> 00:35:52.463
As if he would've had 1.2 billion won.

00:35:56.842 --> 00:35:59.262
The designated driver also said
nothing happened.

00:35:59.345 --> 00:36:01.430
The barbecue place's parking lot
doesn't have CCTV.

00:36:02.974 --> 00:36:04.308
My car was parked here.

00:36:04.392 --> 00:36:05.309
Then…

00:36:06.185 --> 00:36:07.770
It's facing this way.

00:36:11.941 --> 00:36:14.443
I should call the police
and have them investigate…

00:36:15.820 --> 00:36:17.154
But…

00:36:18.030 --> 00:36:22.410
An apple box filled with 1.2 billion won
in the car of an anti-corruption judge.

00:36:24.662 --> 00:36:26.497
That doesn't look good at all.

00:36:27.707 --> 00:36:31.502
It'll look like I've changed my mind
out of fear after accepting the money.

00:36:32.295 --> 00:36:36.882
The crime of bribery is established
the moment you accept it.

00:36:36.966 --> 00:36:40.094
But if it's a bribe,
there has to be someone who gave it!

00:36:40.177 --> 00:36:42.555
The money came first with nobody around…

00:36:45.224 --> 00:36:47.393
That means it wasn't a bribe.
It was a trap.

00:36:49.562 --> 00:36:50.479
It's bait.

00:36:51.272 --> 00:36:52.898
Bait to reel me.

00:36:54.775 --> 00:36:55.776
Is that true?

00:36:56.444 --> 00:36:57.528
Yes, sir.

00:36:57.611 --> 00:37:01.324
Nobody gave all that money,
but it was in a judge's car?

00:37:01.407 --> 00:37:02.867
Who's going to buy that?

00:37:02.950 --> 00:37:05.328
Still, I think I should tell
the police first.

00:37:05.911 --> 00:37:08.581
Their chief respects you so much.

00:37:08.664 --> 00:37:10.249
No.

00:37:10.333 --> 00:37:11.417
Right now, Chief Park

00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:14.503
is desperate to become
commissioner general.

00:37:15.129 --> 00:37:19.133
Cracking down on judges and prosecutors
is their biggest deal. Why?

00:37:19.216 --> 00:37:20.676
Because it'll be on the news.

00:37:21.927 --> 00:37:24.055
You're saying they'll make
a bigger deal out of it?

00:37:26.599 --> 00:37:28.601
This isn't just about you.

00:37:28.684 --> 00:37:31.145
You're famous across the country
as the people's judge.

00:37:31.228 --> 00:37:32.980
If this news spreads, it'll affect you,

00:37:33.064 --> 00:37:34.774
it'll affect me for appointing you…

00:37:34.857 --> 00:37:35.733
You're right.

00:37:36.567 --> 00:37:38.152
It'd be trouble for you too,

00:37:38.235 --> 00:37:41.655
especially during this sensitive period
before a justice appointment.

00:37:44.533 --> 00:37:46.202
Damn it.

00:37:47.828 --> 00:37:52.124
Is there any way
to deal with this quietly?

00:37:53.584 --> 00:37:55.461
Sir, this is bait

00:37:56.337 --> 00:37:58.255
intended to trap us.

00:37:59.006 --> 00:38:01.926
At a time like this,
instead of hiding in fear,

00:38:02.009 --> 00:38:03.552
we have to strike back.

00:38:03.636 --> 00:38:04.678
Strike back?

00:38:10.059 --> 00:38:12.353
This message was in the box.

00:38:13.062 --> 00:38:14.271
Let's do what they want.

00:38:15.731 --> 00:38:17.400
"Use it for a good cause."

00:38:17.483 --> 00:38:19.610
Yes. Since that's what they wrote,

00:38:19.693 --> 00:38:20.903
let's do that.

00:38:20.986 --> 00:38:22.822
What can they do?

00:38:22.905 --> 00:38:24.990
"No, it was actually a bribe."

00:38:25.074 --> 00:38:27.451
"I secretly put it
in Kang Da-wit's car trunk to screw him."

00:38:29.203 --> 00:38:30.746
Will they be able to say that?

00:38:36.168 --> 00:38:37.461
Will it really be okay?

00:38:39.547 --> 00:38:43.050
A HUGE ANONYMOUS DONATION
TO SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT COURT

00:38:43.134 --> 00:38:45.094
It's just right.

00:38:45.177 --> 00:38:47.555
A moving story that's not too big.

00:38:48.556 --> 00:38:51.559
And Mr. Shin was able to
promote himself in the meantime.

00:38:51.642 --> 00:38:52.726
USE IT FOR A GOOD CAUSE

00:38:57.273 --> 00:39:01.235
Okay. What are you going to do now,
you coward?

00:39:01.944 --> 00:39:05.823
You accidentally donated 1.2 billion won
while trying to screw me.

00:39:05.906 --> 00:39:07.908
I bet you'll go to heaven, you prick!

00:39:08.826 --> 00:39:10.161
Good for you, moron!

00:39:11.662 --> 00:39:14.540
Sir, Mr. Shin needs to see you right now.

00:39:14.623 --> 00:39:15.666
What?

00:39:23.632 --> 00:39:24.800
Did you see the article, sir?

00:39:24.884 --> 00:39:26.594
What's your intent, you bastard?

00:39:27.386 --> 00:39:28.762
Sorry? What do you mean, sir?

00:39:37.980 --> 00:39:40.065
Mr. Shin.

00:39:40.149 --> 00:39:41.859
I trusted and guided you

00:39:41.942 --> 00:39:44.320
when you were a nobody
without a college degree.

00:39:45.529 --> 00:39:47.781
How could you betray me like this,
you snake?

00:39:47.865 --> 00:39:51.076
Sir, what on earth are you talking about?

00:40:00.961 --> 00:40:02.296
Go ahead.

00:40:04.715 --> 00:40:05.549
This is…

00:40:07.343 --> 00:40:11.222
Gosh, you shouldn't have.

00:40:11.305 --> 00:40:12.640
Hey.

00:40:18.896 --> 00:40:20.064
It's so heavy.

00:40:25.361 --> 00:40:26.987
Thanks.

00:40:28.155 --> 00:40:29.365
I hope you enjoy.

00:40:37.873 --> 00:40:38.999
That's not…

00:40:39.083 --> 00:40:40.334
That's not me.

00:40:40.876 --> 00:40:42.419
I never did that.

00:40:42.503 --> 00:40:43.671
This is fake.

00:40:43.754 --> 00:40:45.714
Some lunatic is using an altered video

00:40:45.798 --> 00:40:47.258
-to mess with--
-You bastard!

00:40:47.341 --> 00:40:49.260
I can't believe how brazen you are.

00:40:49.343 --> 00:40:51.428
You're still trying to con me
after seeing that?

00:40:51.512 --> 00:40:52.429
What's your intent?

00:40:52.513 --> 00:40:55.224
Why did you drag me into this
after taking that bribe?

00:40:55.307 --> 00:40:57.017
Why?

00:40:57.101 --> 00:40:59.311
"An anonymous benefactor?"
"Use it for a good cause?"

00:40:59.395 --> 00:41:00.980
You son of a…

00:41:01.564 --> 00:41:03.440
You purposely did this
to screw me, didn't you?

00:41:03.524 --> 00:41:05.484
Okay. I'll try to understand.

00:41:05.568 --> 00:41:07.069
Just tell me why.

00:41:07.152 --> 00:41:08.862
-What was your intent?
-No, sir!

00:41:08.946 --> 00:41:12.032
This guy is Kim Ju-seop,
and he owns a countryside orchard.

00:41:12.116 --> 00:41:13.325
What? Kim Ju-seop?

00:41:13.409 --> 00:41:15.119
-A countryside orchard?
-Yes!

00:41:15.202 --> 00:41:16.412
Don't you know who he is?

00:41:22.293 --> 00:41:23.919
He's my friend from elementary school.

00:41:28.090 --> 00:41:29.258
That bastard…

00:41:30.843 --> 00:41:34.054
is Yoo Jae-beom, who I tried
for being a serial con artist.

00:41:34.638 --> 00:41:38.350
He's wanted right now for committing fraud
and fleeing after his release!

00:41:46.150 --> 00:41:47.026
There's no way.

This can't be right.

This can't…

00:42:15.804 --> 00:42:16.639
There's no way.

00:42:21.185 --> 00:42:23.729
The number you have dialed

00:42:26.148 --> 00:42:27.107
No way.

00:42:27.191 --> 00:42:30.194
-The number you have dialed…
-No!

00:42:30.277 --> 00:42:31.236
No.

00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:32.655
-The number you have dialed…
-No.

00:42:32.738 --> 00:42:35.407
-No.
-…is not in service.

00:42:40.537 --> 00:42:41.538
Damn it.

BAE JEONG-HWAN, CLASSMATE

00:42:53.217 --> 00:42:56.470
Hey, Jeong-hwan.
It's me, Da-wit. It's been a while.

00:42:56.553 --> 00:42:57.388
Hey, Da-wit.

00:42:57.471 --> 00:42:59.264
What's with the sudden call?
It's been years.

00:42:59.348 --> 00:43:01.308
Sorry to call so suddenly like this,

00:43:01.392 --> 00:43:03.185
but I'm in a bit of a hurry.

00:43:03.268 --> 00:43:07.523
Do you remember Kim Ju-seop
from our elementary school?

00:43:07.606 --> 00:43:10.401
I was wondering if you knew his number.

00:43:10.484 --> 00:43:11.568
Kim Ju-seop?

00:43:11.652 --> 00:43:14.863
Well, I saw him recently,

00:43:14.947 --> 00:43:16.824
but I don't have his number.

00:43:16.907 --> 00:43:19.660
Are you talking about Juvenile?

00:43:19.743 --> 00:43:20.703
Yes, Kim Juvenile!

00:43:21.203 --> 00:43:22.037
Yeah, that's right.

00:43:22.121 --> 00:43:25.124
What are you talking about, man?
He died ten years ago.

00:43:27.376 --> 00:43:28.335
What?

00:43:28.419 --> 00:43:32.881
He passed away at a young age
from a brain aneurysm.

00:43:32.965 --> 00:43:34.258
It ran in his family.

00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:38.095
But what do you mean you saw him recently?

00:43:44.351 --> 00:43:45.269
Actually…

00:43:46.437 --> 00:43:49.022
I must have been mistaken.
Sorry to bother you.

00:43:49.940 --> 00:43:51.358
I'll call you next time.

00:44:01.243 --> 00:44:02.453
To me,

00:44:03.203 --> 00:44:05.080
life hasn't been
a box of sweet chocolates.

00:44:05.956 --> 00:44:07.750
It's been a box of poisonous apples,

00:44:08.959 --> 00:44:12.671
no matter how hard I tried.

00:44:16.967 --> 00:44:19.261
You think I'm Snow White or something?

00:44:20.262 --> 00:44:23.015
Did you think I'd die
after eating those poisonous apple?

00:44:25.934 --> 00:44:28.395
Do you know
what I went through to get here?

00:44:30.856 --> 00:44:32.858
Geez, how much is that?

00:44:33.984 --> 00:44:36.111
Hey. I was right, wasn't I?

00:44:36.195 --> 00:44:37.446
It's a deepfake.

00:44:37.529 --> 00:44:39.656
I never did that. I remember clearly.

00:44:39.740 --> 00:44:41.116
-Judge Kang.
-Yeah?

00:44:42.034 --> 00:44:45.287
Current deepfake technology
can't look this natural yet.

00:44:46.121 --> 00:44:48.540
How did they fake this?
Why does it look so real?

00:44:48.624 --> 00:44:50.125
I'm really sorry,

00:44:52.419 --> 00:44:54.797
but I looked at it frame by frame.

00:44:54.880 --> 00:44:59.635
I also checked the sources,
but this video is real.

00:45:01.762 --> 00:45:05.098
Then, they must have hired someone
who looks just like me--

00:45:05.182 --> 00:45:06.266
Sir.

00:45:12.648 --> 00:45:15.192
You don't have a twin brother, do you? No.

00:45:16.443 --> 00:45:17.819
Be honest.

00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:19.613
Did you take the money or not?

00:45:22.407 --> 00:45:23.408
Stop snapping.

00:45:26.578 --> 00:45:27.663
This is driving me crazy.

00:45:27.746 --> 00:45:29.790
Did I really lose my mind?

00:45:29.873 --> 00:45:31.333
If this wasn't altered,

00:45:31.416 --> 00:45:32.918
you're saying that really is me?

00:45:34.753 --> 00:45:36.463
That's really me?

00:45:38.507 --> 00:45:41.426
COURT

00:45:47.140 --> 00:45:49.977
Please give me some time, sir.

00:45:50.060 --> 00:45:52.104
I'll pull all the strings I have

00:45:52.187 --> 00:45:53.897
and get to the bottom of--

00:45:53.981 --> 00:45:55.315
Make a choice.

00:45:57.943 --> 00:45:58.819
Sir? What choice?

00:46:00.070 --> 00:46:03.031
Are you going to quietly quit
before word gets out?

00:46:03.115 --> 00:46:05.867
Or will you face a police investigation
for taking a big bribe

00:46:06.702 --> 00:46:08.245
from a serial con artist?

00:46:08.328 --> 00:46:10.080
No!

00:46:10.163 --> 00:46:12.332
This was a trap!

00:46:12.416 --> 00:46:15.627
-It wasn't me! No!
-The people's judge!

00:46:15.711 --> 00:46:17.796
I trusted you so much!

00:46:17.879 --> 00:46:19.923
No, I didn't do it!

00:46:27.598 --> 00:46:28.557
Sir.

00:46:30.892 --> 00:46:32.102
It seems I have your answer.

00:46:32.686 --> 00:46:34.771
Submit your resignation letter
right away.

00:46:35.856 --> 00:46:37.774
By the way, even if you quit,

00:46:37.858 --> 00:46:42.237
you won't be able to open
a law office for a while.

00:46:43.864 --> 00:46:45.365
What do you mean?

00:46:46.742 --> 00:46:48.619
Dr. Oh Gyu-jang
pulled some strings,

00:46:48.702 --> 00:46:50.537
so we were just able
to quietly cover this up.

00:46:50.621 --> 00:46:52.873
But as the chair
of the bar association,

00:46:53.749 --> 00:46:56.418
he can't allow a corrupt judge like you…

00:46:57.753 --> 00:46:59.046
to become an attorney.

00:47:03.091 --> 00:47:05.177
A corrupt judge? Sir, I'm so--

00:47:08.555 --> 00:47:11.141
After personally receiving that bribe,

00:47:11.224 --> 00:47:13.101
you're still being this shameless?

00:47:15.020 --> 00:47:17.814
You should thank me for letting you quit

00:47:18.899 --> 00:47:20.442
without telling anyone.

00:47:20.525 --> 00:47:23.862
Whether you be a law firm office manager
in the country or do manual labor,

00:47:25.155 --> 00:47:26.323
just live quietly.

00:47:26.865 --> 00:47:28.742
And don't come anywhere near us
in Seocho-dong.

It was only the first step.

00:47:55.018 --> 00:47:56.228
I was so close.

00:47:59.231 --> 00:48:00.107
Da-wit.

00:48:01.775 --> 00:48:03.026
Just promise me…

two things.

00:48:06.238 --> 00:48:07.447
Cremate me

00:48:08.198 --> 00:48:10.742
and spread my ash over a river…

00:48:13.245 --> 00:48:14.955
so that you won't have to

00:48:16.039 --> 00:48:18.834
come to see me every year.

00:48:19.793 --> 00:48:20.794
Okay?

00:48:24.089 --> 00:48:25.090
Mom.

00:48:26.007 --> 00:48:27.676
Don't look back.

00:48:30.095 --> 00:48:31.221
Keep moving forward.

00:48:32.431 --> 00:48:33.557
Just keep moving forward…

00:48:35.183 --> 00:48:36.601
without stopping.

00:48:39.980 --> 00:48:42.190
You must…

00:48:43.108 --> 00:48:44.943
become successful.

00:48:48.321 --> 00:48:49.740
You have to succeed

00:48:50.615 --> 00:48:52.492
so people won't look down on you.

00:48:56.288 --> 00:48:58.081
Go as far…

00:48:59.583 --> 00:49:00.667
as you can,

00:49:01.293 --> 00:49:02.335
my son.

00:49:04.671 --> 00:49:05.505
Got it?

00:49:07.340 --> 00:49:08.842
Mom.

00:49:16.141 --> 00:49:17.559
Mom.

00:49:40.332 --> 00:49:41.249
Hello?

00:49:41.792 --> 00:49:42.626
It's me.

00:49:44.336 --> 00:49:45.962
Who is this?

00:49:47.088 --> 00:49:50.133
Unbelievable. Da-wit, it's me.

00:49:51.051 --> 00:49:52.010
Don't you remember me?

00:49:52.677 --> 00:49:53.553
Oh Jung-in?

00:49:59.643 --> 00:50:00.477
Da-wit.

00:50:05.816 --> 00:50:07.567
You remembered my voice after all.

00:50:10.612 --> 00:50:12.155
How could I forget?

00:50:13.907 --> 00:50:14.783
It's your voice.

00:50:15.992 --> 00:50:17.786
You haven't changed a bit.

00:50:19.037 --> 00:50:20.497
You're still so cringe.

00:50:21.122 --> 00:50:22.707
You haven't changed either.

00:50:22.791 --> 00:50:24.668
You talk casually to me
whenever you please.

00:50:26.920 --> 00:50:28.296
What's the occasion?

00:50:28.380 --> 00:50:30.215
We haven't been in touch
since our training.

00:50:30.298 --> 00:50:31.216
Never mind that.

00:50:32.968 --> 00:50:34.135
Come join my law firm.

00:50:36.930 --> 00:50:38.932
Your firm? Oh & Partners?

00:50:40.684 --> 00:50:43.770
I heard all about what happened to you.

00:50:46.356 --> 00:50:47.232
What do you mean?

00:50:49.109 --> 00:50:50.819
Don't ask me how I found out.

00:50:58.118 --> 00:50:59.452
Jung-in, I--

00:50:59.536 --> 00:51:00.829
The attorney registration?

00:51:01.413 --> 00:51:04.124
Don't worry. I've already persuaded Dad.

00:51:05.125 --> 00:51:06.710
You persuaded Dr. Oh?

00:51:07.419 --> 00:51:08.253
Yeah.

00:51:09.546 --> 00:51:12.299
Why? Why would you
go through all the hassle…

00:51:12.382 --> 00:51:13.258
To help you?

00:51:14.926 --> 00:51:15.802
No.

00:51:18.805 --> 00:51:20.724
I want you to help me.

00:51:28.857 --> 00:51:30.233

You didn't even give us a heads up.

I'm sorry.

00:51:42.871 --> 00:51:44.748
It wasn't a choice
I could consult with others.

00:51:44.831 --> 00:51:46.750
Sir, what's going on?

00:51:46.833 --> 00:51:49.377
It's not hiring season,
so why are you resigning?

00:51:49.461 --> 00:51:52.172
The justice position
was right in front of you. So why…

00:51:54.466 --> 00:51:56.426
I'm pretty exhausted.

00:51:56.509 --> 00:51:59.679
I'll get some rest
and talk to you about it later.

00:52:01.181 --> 00:52:02.474
Sir.

00:52:03.558 --> 00:52:06.353
Don't worry. I'll be back.

00:52:09.940 --> 00:52:11.399
No matter what.

00:52:27.666 --> 00:52:30.919
Founded by Dr. Oh Gyu-jang,
the giant who controls

00:52:31.002 --> 00:52:32.462
the legal world from the shadows,

00:52:32.545 --> 00:52:37.884
Oh & Partners is Korea's top law firm
with its finest attorneys.

00:52:43.264 --> 00:52:45.642
Yes. It's a place that suits me perfectly.

00:52:47.894 --> 00:52:50.981
Using this as a stepping stone,
I will go back

00:52:52.065 --> 00:52:53.525
to the place I belong.

00:53:00.865 --> 00:53:01.825
Jung-in?

00:53:02.450 --> 00:53:03.535
Welcome.

00:53:05.578 --> 00:53:06.913
It's pretty bright in here.

00:53:06.997 --> 00:53:08.206
Hold on.

00:53:13.211 --> 00:53:14.045
But you know what?

00:53:15.005 --> 00:53:16.506
This place is pretty nice.

00:53:16.589 --> 00:53:20.677
The managing partner's office
in Korea's top law firm.

00:53:21.261 --> 00:53:22.929
It's spacious, isn't it?

00:53:23.013 --> 00:53:25.807
But doesn't it feel a bit empty?

00:53:25.890 --> 00:53:30.812
No. The empty space
is supposed to help with your creativity.

00:53:30.895 --> 00:53:31.855
Really?

00:53:31.938 --> 00:53:35.400
By the way, the windows
must be facing southeast.

00:53:35.483 --> 00:53:36.985
They get plenty of sun.

00:53:37.485 --> 00:53:39.612
I personally like it
when they face southwest.

00:53:39.696 --> 00:53:42.032
I tend to enjoy the afternoon sun.

00:53:42.115 --> 00:53:43.408
Is that so?

00:53:43.491 --> 00:53:45.452
The decor isn't bad either.

00:53:45.535 --> 00:53:47.662
All the partner offices
are pretty similar, right?

00:53:48.413 --> 00:53:51.166
Well, yeah. They're basically the same.

00:53:51.249 --> 00:53:52.709
I see.

00:53:58.089 --> 00:54:00.425
Jung-in, I want to thank you.

00:54:00.508 --> 00:54:02.052
I won't forget your kindness.

00:54:02.135 --> 00:54:04.304
I will build Oh & Partners

00:54:04.387 --> 00:54:06.598
into a global law firm.

00:54:06.681 --> 00:54:08.641
You know I'm a man of my word.

00:54:11.269 --> 00:54:13.938
That passion of yours never wanes.

00:54:15.940 --> 00:54:17.692
Was that why I fell for you?

00:54:21.029 --> 00:54:23.406
It was because of my passion?

00:54:23.990 --> 00:54:26.868
I thought it was because of my good looks.

00:54:29.162 --> 00:54:30.622
And you still have that confidence.

00:54:31.206 --> 00:54:33.458
Follow me. I'll show you your spot.

00:54:34.209 --> 00:54:35.460
But I just sat down.

00:54:36.419 --> 00:54:37.420
Let's go.

00:54:38.088 --> 00:54:39.589
I'd love to see my office.

00:54:39.672 --> 00:54:42.592
I like the offices on this side too.

00:54:42.675 --> 00:54:44.177
Is this my office?

00:54:44.260 --> 00:54:46.513
No, it's this way.
We just need to go down the stairs.

00:54:46.596 --> 00:54:49.307
The stairs? But what about the elevators?

00:54:49.390 --> 00:54:50.725
What? You don't like stairs?

00:54:51.267 --> 00:54:53.478
No, I love stairs. It's a good workout.

00:54:53.978 --> 00:54:57.065
-That's good news, then.
-What do you mean?

00:54:57.774 --> 00:54:59.109
You'll see once you get there.

00:55:01.361 --> 00:55:02.445
There's an atrium too.

00:55:03.071 --> 00:55:06.366
-The firm's grown a lot.
-We have a lot of attorneys now.

00:55:07.033 --> 00:55:09.160
We've launched a Pro Bono Team too.

00:55:09.744 --> 00:55:11.621
Pro bono? Free representation?

00:55:12.288 --> 00:55:14.332
Don't call it free.

00:55:15.041 --> 00:55:16.960
Pro bono publico.

00:55:17.043 --> 00:55:18.586
It's a team for public interest cases.

00:55:18.670 --> 00:55:20.755
Right, a free lawsuit team.

00:55:20.839 --> 00:55:21.714
Wait.

00:55:21.798 --> 00:55:25.009
A firm like Oh & Partners
that charges a million won per hour

00:55:25.093 --> 00:55:26.845
has a team
that doesn't make money?

00:55:27.637 --> 00:55:28.555
Why?

00:55:29.848 --> 00:55:32.058
Law firms also have
social responsibilities.

00:55:32.767 --> 00:55:33.810
Haven't you heard of ESG?

00:55:33.893 --> 00:55:35.645
ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL, AND GOVERNANCE

00:55:35.728 --> 00:55:37.438
We're almost there. Come this way.

00:55:45.530 --> 00:55:48.116
Wait. I hear dogs barking.

00:55:48.867 --> 00:55:49.701
Why would dogs be…

00:55:52.370 --> 00:55:53.788
Hey!

00:55:53.872 --> 00:55:57.000
-Why did you put this up here?
-You can't let them go here.

00:55:57.083 --> 00:55:58.585
-What is this place?
-This is crazy.

00:55:58.668 --> 00:55:59.794
-No!
-Everyone!

00:55:59.878 --> 00:56:01.171
Team Pro Bono!

00:56:02.714 --> 00:56:05.592
Attorney Kang Da-wit is here.

00:56:05.675 --> 00:56:06.759
-Hello!
-Welcome, sir!

00:56:14.017 --> 00:56:15.518
Ddol-i, no!

00:56:16.311 --> 00:56:18.479
Hey, this can't be…

00:56:18.563 --> 00:56:20.565
This is where you'll be working now.

00:56:23.318 --> 00:56:26.821
It's a team for public interest cases,
not free cases.

00:56:29.365 --> 00:56:30.742
-One moment.
-I need a moment too.

00:56:30.825 --> 00:56:32.327
-Jung-in. Hey.
-Hello?

00:56:33.703 --> 00:56:35.830
Why is it so dark in here?

00:56:35.914 --> 00:56:37.290
-It's shady, isn't it?
-What?

00:56:37.373 --> 00:56:39.751
That's why mushrooms grow well in here.

00:56:40.335 --> 00:56:41.711
This is shiitake mushroom tea.

00:56:43.046 --> 00:56:44.422
Shiitake mushroom…

00:56:45.006 --> 00:56:46.007
Sorry.

00:56:46.090 --> 00:56:49.135
We're handling a case involving those
who rescue abandoned dogs.

00:56:49.219 --> 00:56:53.306
We have to look after the dogs
while they're being investigated.

00:56:53.389 --> 00:56:54.224
Ddol-i!

00:56:54.307 --> 00:56:55.808
There you are. Come here, Ddol-i.

00:56:55.892 --> 00:56:57.018
You have to go inside now.

00:56:57.602 --> 00:56:59.270
I heard you were a prominent judge.

00:57:00.772 --> 00:57:02.148
Please teach me your ways!

00:57:02.232 --> 00:57:05.360
I'm Hwang Jun-u, a young attorney
who's always eager to learn.

00:57:05.443 --> 00:57:07.237
Let me say hi too. Good boy.

00:57:07.320 --> 00:57:08.738
-Just a minute.
-Sorry.

00:57:08.821 --> 00:57:10.990
Hello, I'm Attorney Yoo Nan-hui!

00:57:11.574 --> 00:57:15.328
I'm interested in women's rights,
child welfare, and animal rights.

00:57:17.705 --> 00:57:22.126
-Why do they keep giving me stuff?
-Which areas are you interested in, sir?

00:57:23.044 --> 00:57:23.962
Well…

00:57:24.963 --> 00:57:26.714
Anything that concerns public interest.

00:57:26.798 --> 00:57:28.841
Really? I knew it.

00:57:28.925 --> 00:57:30.009
Attorney Jang.

00:57:30.802 --> 00:57:32.136
Right, yes.

00:57:33.680 --> 00:57:35.014
Just wait here for a bit.

00:57:35.098 --> 00:57:36.474
I'm…

00:57:37.100 --> 00:57:39.394
I'm Jang Yeong-sil.

00:57:39.477 --> 00:57:41.521
It's a strange name, isn't it?

00:57:41.604 --> 00:57:43.439
It's nice. It sounds
like an inventor's name.

00:57:44.148 --> 00:57:44.983
Right.

00:57:45.066 --> 00:57:48.111
Attorney Jang has more experience
as a PA than anyone else here,

00:57:48.194 --> 00:57:49.821
-which is eight years.
-A PA?

00:57:49.904 --> 00:57:51.281
-It's--
-You don't know?

00:57:51.364 --> 00:57:54.617
Attorneys specializing
in public interest cases are called PAs.

00:57:54.701 --> 00:57:57.829
-And we're AA members as well.
-Yes.

00:57:57.912 --> 00:57:59.247
What are AAs?

00:57:59.330 --> 00:58:01.124
-AAs are--
-A group of attorneys who protect

00:58:01.207 --> 00:58:02.834
the rights of non-human animals.

00:58:05.086 --> 00:58:06.546
And what are non-human animals?

00:58:06.629 --> 00:58:08.381
-Non--
-Humans always think

00:58:08.464 --> 00:58:10.842
they're special and not like animals.

00:58:10.925 --> 00:58:14.345
To stay away from such human-centric,
species-discriminating views,

00:58:14.429 --> 00:58:18.558
we've started using terms
like human animals and non-human animals.

00:58:18.641 --> 00:58:19.559
That's right.

00:58:21.686 --> 00:58:23.479
You've got to be kidding me.

00:58:23.563 --> 00:58:25.982
PAs and AAs.

00:58:26.065 --> 00:58:29.193
I'm a CA. An attorney who's going crazy.

00:58:29.694 --> 00:58:32.447
A team for public interest cases
in charge of free lawsuits.

00:58:33.031 --> 00:58:35.992
She put me in this shady place
with freeloaders

00:58:36.075 --> 00:58:39.245
who don't contribute any revenue,
and thus, have no voice in the company.

00:58:41.122 --> 00:58:42.665
What about my stepping stone?

00:58:42.749 --> 00:58:44.000
And my return?

00:58:45.418 --> 00:58:47.253
And my success?

00:58:47.337 --> 00:58:49.881
Hello! You're the new attorney,
aren't you?

00:58:49.964 --> 00:58:52.133
I'm Park Gi-ppeum. Welcome to Team Pro…

00:58:52.925 --> 00:58:53.760
Bono.

00:58:56.679 --> 00:58:57.555
You're him.

00:58:58.097 --> 00:59:00.099
That prick from that one time…

00:59:01.142 --> 00:59:02.435
who pretended to help me.

00:59:03.269 --> 00:59:05.480
Hey, what are you doing here?

00:59:05.563 --> 00:59:07.523
It's not easy to get into this law firm.

00:59:09.817 --> 00:59:11.861
You really are something else.

00:59:11.944 --> 00:59:13.196
You did all that bragging

00:59:13.279 --> 00:59:14.906
about how important you were.

00:59:15.615 --> 00:59:18.242
You never know where life will take you.

00:59:19.285 --> 00:59:21.537
We'll be making copies together now.

00:59:21.621 --> 00:59:22.622
-Copies?
-How wonderful.

00:59:22.705 --> 00:59:24.832
We were so short-handed

00:59:24.916 --> 00:59:27.168
that we were about to find
some cats to help us.

00:59:27.752 --> 00:59:29.879
We're so lucky!

00:59:29.962 --> 00:59:32.674
-Welcome to the team!
-Welcome to the team!

00:59:32.757 --> 00:59:33.800
-Really.
-Welcome!

00:59:33.883 --> 00:59:35.426
-Welcome.
-We should celebrate.

00:59:35.510 --> 00:59:37.345
-Let's have dinner tonight.
-What do you like?

00:59:37.428 --> 00:59:38.596
-What do you like?
-Me?

00:59:41.933 --> 00:59:44.811
Why am I here?

00:59:46.604 --> 00:59:48.815
What am I going to do

00:59:49.399 --> 00:59:50.566
with those people?

00:59:53.569 --> 00:59:55.279
My glorious road to success.

00:59:56.447 --> 00:59:59.992
I was walking down the path to success
adorned with wealth and fame.

01:00:01.119 --> 01:00:04.038
Why do I have to handle
all these miscellaneous cases

01:00:04.122 --> 01:00:06.708
with those weird pro bono losers

01:00:06.791 --> 01:00:09.752
in the corner without any sunlight? Why?

01:00:09.836 --> 01:00:15.007
Why?

01:00:20.263 --> 01:00:21.264
This darn bread!

01:00:55.757 --> 01:00:58.634
You ******* dog!

01:00:59.844 --> 01:01:05.558
I want to go back!

01:01:30.875 --> 01:01:33.711
How could you send me
to that kind of place without asking me?

01:01:33.795 --> 01:01:35.838
What are you doing to our client?

01:01:35.922 --> 01:01:38.424
From chaebol CEO trials
to a case of a stolen mutt…

01:01:38.508 --> 01:01:40.301
I heard you're a pro bono attorney now.

01:01:40.384 --> 01:01:41.594
Did something happen?

01:01:41.677 --> 01:01:44.347
If Myeong-hun's on this case,
it won't end easily.

01:01:44.430 --> 01:01:46.808
-Do you know how much Chloe is worth?
-Oh, my gosh!

01:01:46.891 --> 01:01:49.101
Our Byeol… I won't let her go.

01:01:49.185 --> 01:01:50.269
Chloe!

01:01:50.353 --> 01:01:51.896
-We have to resolve it.
-At any cost.

01:01:51.979 --> 01:01:53.940
I think you've seen
too many Hollywood movies.

01:01:54.023 --> 01:01:55.107
I thought it was okay.

01:01:55.191 --> 01:01:58.236
-It's the blunt judge!
-Your goal was to change the judge.

01:01:58.319 --> 01:01:59.654
Hey, you little… You punk!

01:01:59.737 --> 01:02:01.948
-But is that possible?
-You have to win the case.

01:02:02.031 --> 01:02:03.616
You could teach me since I don't know.

01:02:03.699 --> 01:02:05.159
-The first reaction.
-"Where?"

01:02:05.243 --> 01:02:08.704
I'll take charge
of those pro bono losers for a year.

01:02:08.788 --> 01:02:11.040
-You want to make a deal?
-Make me a justice candidate.

01:02:11.874 --> 01:02:13.459
That's my condition.

01:02:19.173 --> 01:02:21.175
