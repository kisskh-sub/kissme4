00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:45.800
Brighten up!

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:47.080
You've been down

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.039
since the interview.

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:50.520
Cheer up!

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.840
Fruit?

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.280
Yeah, the amusement park's

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.040
having a family event

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.080
on Children's Day.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.840
Want to go?

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:06.520
Could be fun!

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.600
Nian's dying to, alright?

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.040
Dude, June 1st?

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.880
Gonna be crazy hot and packed!

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.480
- Check this out.
- You take Nian.

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.280
The thought alone makes me cringe...

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.360
Just take a look.

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:21.480
We'll be packed like sardines,

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.960
- seriously.
- Please, just look?

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:24.360
Plus,

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.720
with Nian's condition...

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:26.320
[Special Family Event!]

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:27.280
[Grand Opening!]

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:28.840
[Join the fun...]

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.920
You know what? We should go.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.520
Good character building.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.400
So that's a yes?

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:40.640
Absolutely!

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.640
Look at all these people!

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:52.640
Well,

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.240
it is Children's Day!

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:03.800
Gates are open!

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:04.560
C'mon, let's go!

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:05.880
No need to rush.

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.840
Enter later?

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:07.520
Yeah,

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:08.480
till this mob thins out.

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:10.560
No point

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:11.720
getting crushed in this heat.

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:18.000
Good to go now?

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.120
Yeah, yeah, looking better.

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:20.920
Hey,

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:21.720
maybe take Nian

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:22.560
to the bathroom first?

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:23.880
It'll be

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.160
a nightmare inside.

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:27.200
This one seems OK.

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.440
Nian, bathroom?

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:29.280
Go.

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.560
Excuse us.

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.240
Pretty packed today.

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.200
Yeah, Mr. Xing.

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:53.600
Our marketing

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:54.480
really

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:55.320
did the trick.

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:57.240
Mr. Xiao,

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.000
great job running this place!

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:00.280
Mr. Xing!

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:01.600
Mr. Xing!

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:03.240
Someone's calling you.

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.600
Remember me? Li Daoqi,

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:08.960
dropped by with Dong the other day?

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:11.480
Ah! With Dr. Fu,

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.400
- the guy from overseas?
- Yeah!

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:14.680
You guys with the

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:15.480
makeup brand pitch?

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.200
Yep, that's us!

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:18.320
You here to

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:19.480
check things out too?

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.000
Yeah, just unwinding.

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:22.560
Spending the holiday

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:23.360
with my wife

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:24.240
and kid.

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:25.840
Talk about luck!

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.000
Indeed. Let's go.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.520
OK.

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:28.240
We're heading in.

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:39.880
Sir, public entrance is that way.

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:40.840
Oh, but I'm...

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:41.760
He's with us.

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:42.320
Got it.

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:46.520
Where're you off to?

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.040
[Bumped into someone.]

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:49.200
[See you inside.]

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.920
[Gotta run!]

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:51.480
Hey?

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:52.760
Hey!

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:58.080
Nian, let's go.

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.240
Wasn't this planned?

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:04.880
Just an influencer doing a dance.

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:05.400
Folks!

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:06.560
Pardon us!

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.640
Coming through!

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.320
Hey, heads up,

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.680
The Dreamland's swamped.

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.480
Take Nian to

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:16.760
Rainbow Playland,

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:18.280
catch you there.

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:20.880
Mr. Xing, we got an influencer

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.000
doing promo for the opening day.

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:26.320
Let's check that out.

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:27.040
You got it.

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:28.400
What a coincidence!

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:29.760
Could've totally

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:30.440
missed each other.

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:31.080
Right?

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:31.680
Yeah!

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:34.040
Amazing, huh?

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.040
Must be fate.

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:37.520
Yeah, fate.

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:39.120
C'mon,

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:40.400
excuse us, kids.

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:41.280
Hey kids.

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:42.480
Please.

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:10.960
Mr. Xiao,

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:12.440
can't slack on

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:13.720
those safety checks!

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:14.240
No worries,

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:15.480
we're on top of it.

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:15.920
Good.

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:17.240
Are you doing an inspection?

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:18.720
Cuz I got shares in this place.

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:19.360
Yep,

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:21.200
he's our biggest investor.

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:23.080
Quite an empire you've built!

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:25.880
Oh no, not for me.

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:26.480
Makes

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:27.720
my stomach turn.

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:29.360
Heights freak me out.

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:30.800
Heights get you?

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:31.760
Yeah.

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:33.040
See,

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:34.480
that's your

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:35.480
weak spot.

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:37.680
You know,

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:38.360
business is

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:39.640
much like

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:40.520
this roller coaster.

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:41.240
Totally.

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:43.000
Can't let fear hold you back!

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:43.600
Right.

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:45.640
Wanna do business with me?

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:47.640
Face your fears first!

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:51.840
Let's show him!

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:52.560
You got it.

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:04.480
This way in?

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:05.000
Yeah.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.240
I was kidding, Mr. Xing!

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:08.040
As if someone tall as me

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:09.520
would fear heights!

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:11.240
I'm in!

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:12.160
You sure?

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:12.920
Yeah,

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:13.960
all in!

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:15.200
Don't be a hero.

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:16.200
If you can't,

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:17.520
just say so.

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:18.120
No, really.

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:18.960
Don't push it.

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:19.920
I got this, let's roll.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:20.440
Really?

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:21.280
Yeah, let's do it.

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:22.400
- Go!
- Good!

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:30.520
That thing goes upside down?

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:31.000
Uh-huh.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:31.480
Yeah.

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:33.800
C'mon, Daoqi!

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.640
Daoqi, VIP line! Go!

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:36.960
Gotta take this call...

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:38.040
Real quick.

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:38.800
Hurry up!

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:39.440
OK.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:40.880
Let's go!

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:00.320
OK, OK.

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:01.760
A for effort!

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.360
Daoqi, I saw that.

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:04.920
You should

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:06.800
sit this one out.

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:08.080
No way, Mr. Xing!

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:09.560
I'm so going!

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:11.280
I'm good.

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:12.640
Just had to

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:13.800
clear the system.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.320
Good to go now!

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:16.080
You sure?

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:17.480
Totally!

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:22.440
Onwards to glory!

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:27.960
Mr. Xing!

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:31.560
Gonna puke again!

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:34.960
Heads up, Mr. Xing!

00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:43.840
Where'd all that

00:08:44.039 --> 00:08:44.680
come from?

00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:45.920
Thought you were empty!

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:47.360
Guess that was yesterday's dinner.

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:48.000
I'm so sorry,

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:49.040
really really sorry.

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:49.600
Sorry.

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:51.000
You got me good,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.280
but a deal's a deal.

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:53.760
On Monday, bring your PhD buddy

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:54.360
to my office.

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:55.280
We'll talk business.

00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:56.200
Keep your distance!

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:57.520
Don't want

00:08:57.520 --> 00:08:58.840
round two!

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:00.400
Sorry about that, Mr. Xing!

00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:01.600
Monday then!

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:03.160
Yeah, see you on Monday.

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:03.880
[Cool.]

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:05.320
Really sorry, Mr. Xing!

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:06.360
[No worries!]

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:08.480
Should've

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:09.520
skipped breakfast.

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:13.640
Hey everyone,

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:14.680
check out

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:16.360
many new themes...

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:18.600
Heading out now?

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:19.640
Got fireworks tonight,

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:20.640
you know?

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:22.800
How about it, Nian?

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:24.640
Nian,

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:26.120
we got up early,

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:27.440
played all day.

00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:29.000
Mommy will

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.480
bring you back

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:32.040
another time for fireworks,

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:32.760
OK?

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:36.360
Leaving now?

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:39.480
Hey, you know,

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:40.640
it's my lucky day today!

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:42.200
Feel like things are

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:43.760
finally going my way.

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:45.240
Once this works out,

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:46.000
I'll share everything with you.

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:49.800
Just one look?

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:51.120
Heard it's amazing.

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:54.040
Really leaving?

00:09:58.160 --> 00:09:59.600
I want to see it!

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:02.440
Ms. Zhao, dog walking?

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:04.120
Dong,

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:06.000
grabbing breakfast?

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:06.800
Uncle Li.

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:07.960
Got a favor

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:08.480
to ask.

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:08.880
What's up?

00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:10.960
Washing machine's broken.

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:12.000
Can you

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.160
take a look today?

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:14.440
I've resigned.

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:16.160
Not with ProFix anymore.

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:17.480
You...resigned?

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:18.680
Gonna start something with a friend.

00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:19.880
Getting back

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:21.080
to chemistry, my old field.

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:22.560
Wonderful!

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:24.320
Fixing stuff was

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:25.640
wasting your talent.

00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:26.600
Nah.

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:28.240
Congrats!

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:29.360
Good luck!

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:30.000
Thanks!

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:34.080
Uncle Li,

00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:35.560
playing chess

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:37.080
in this rain?

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:39.600
Better than sitting at home!

00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:41.120
Check!

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:43.720
OK.

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:48.520
Just let us know

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:49.840
when you're

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:50.760
coming late

00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:52.280
or leaving early.

00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:54.560
You were snoring away

00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:56.120
when she was back in the dead of night.

00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:57.240
I heard her.

00:10:57.280 --> 00:10:58.080
Hey, the company's

00:10:58.080 --> 00:10:59.440
finally seeing my worth.

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:01.040
Big meeting last night,

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:02.960
the whole room talking about

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:04.160
my future.

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:05.960
For real.

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:09.440
Another stream?

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:12.280
Yeah, that was before...

00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:14.080
When did you stream?

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:14.760
Didn't catch it?

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:16.920
Never told us.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.000
I'll...give a like.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:18.840
No need,

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:19.880
c'mon, let's eat first.

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:21.240
Mom, Dad, I'm back!

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:22.040
Just eat,

00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:23.080
one like won't make a difference.

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:24.600
Up already?

00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:27.920
Was gonna

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:28.960
work out

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:30.000
but got rained out.

00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:31.880
Grabbed some

00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:32.680
buns and

00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:33.840
meat swallow wontons instead.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.040
Quite a downpour.

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:36.760
About that stream,

00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:38.120
you didn't finish.

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:39.080
What was it about?

00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:40.000
Oh,

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.720
nothing much,

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:42.640
just regular stuff,

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:43.680
same stuff,

00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:45.160
you know?

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:47.160
Stream? You streamed?

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:49.200
Missed it?

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:51.440
Too busy.

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:52.480
Skip it,

00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:53.640
it's nothing.

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:54.720
Eat up.

00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:55.240
Let me.

00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:00.120
Still in elevator, already here.

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:00.920
Morning, Ran!

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:01.840
Morning.

00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:04.640
Ran, morning.

00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:06.200
Morning.

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:08.280
Morning, Ran.

00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:09.400
Morning.

00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:10.960
Ran, morning.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:11.680
Morning.

00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:12.600
Morning, Ran.

00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:13.560
Morning.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.880
Everyone's acting super weird.

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:18.840
Ran.

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:19.560
C'mon.

00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:20.880
What's up? I'm on time.

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:21.400
What's the rush?

00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:22.000
Move it!

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:25.160
- Morning, Ran.
- Morning.

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:25.840
Over here.

00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:26.800
What's all this?

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:27.680
Ms. Qian's waiting.

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:30.000
I'll take your bag.

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:31.520
Hey.

00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:33.200
Look for me?

00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:34.000
- Here!
- Ran.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.360
Good, talking about you.

00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:37.240
We chopped up your

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:37.920
"Little White Sail"

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:38.680
from yesterday,

00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:39.720
spread it

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:40.400
across

00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:41.480
other accounts.

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:42.960
Totally blew up.

00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:44.000
You made clips?

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.000
It's killing it!

00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:46.600
I just wrapped up a plan.

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:47.800
Yeah, show her.

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:48.320
Roger!

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:50.480
OK, now, let me share with you

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:52.200
this proposal I just finished,

00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:54.680
"The Desperation Series".

00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:55.520
Look,

00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:56.480
your stream

00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:57.480
was fire yesterday, right?

00:12:57.480 --> 00:12:59.000
You went viral as

00:12:59.080 --> 00:12:59.760
the "Desperate Personal Shopper",

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:00.760
so we propose

00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:02.280
expanding

00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:03.640
this concept.

"Desperate Housewife",

00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:06.320

"Desperate Daughter",

"Desperate Mom",

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:10.560
"Desperate Employee".

00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:12.200
Yeah? How desperate is it?

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:13.520
Super desperate!

00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:15.000
See, right?

00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:16.920
I'll go all desperate!

00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:57.720
Mr. Xing, didn't know

00:14:57.720 --> 00:14:59.280
you were into football.

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:02.880
We often do soccer games

00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:04.800
for team building.

00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:06.560
Join us

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:08.080
if you're into it.

00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:10.480
OK.

00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:11.520
Cool.

00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:15.720
Dr. Fu should come too.

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:21.560
Guess Dr. Fu

00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:23.600
doesn't like football, huh?

00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:24.360
Mr. Li,

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:26.160
let's talk business.

00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:27.560
Mr. Li!

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:30.320
Right, business.

00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:31.960
Yeah, that proposal

00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:32.440
I've worked on...

00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:33.880
Look, Mr. Li,

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:34.720
I've told you,

00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:35.720
I'm just not into

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:37.080
that proposal.

00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:39.760
Buying

00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:40.560
cosmetic brands?

00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:41.560
It won't fly.

00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:43.280
I'll explain why.

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:44.280
First,

00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:46.120
our research shows that

00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:48.600
today's consumers,

00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:51.440
especially in domestic skincare,

00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:53.400
prefer

00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:55.120
fresh concepts and new brands,

00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:56.320
instead of

00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:57.520
old ones.

00:15:57.920 --> 00:15:58.480
Second,

00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:00.880
buying a factory?

00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:02.360
That's heavy assets, man.

00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:04.120
It goes totally against

00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:05.800
my investment style.

00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:07.520
It's not just about the factory,

00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:08.320
I'm after

00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:09.720
all the formulas too.

00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:10.360
Hold it, hold it.

00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:12.080
I know tons of

00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:12.960
OEM factories.

00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:15.880
I can get any formula I want.

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:17.360
Hyaluronic acid,

00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:18.400
retinol,

00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:19.440
hexapeptide,

00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:21.000
whatever's hot.

00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:23.120
Why would I

00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:25.000
waste money on old formulas

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.760
from a dying factory?

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:28.680
Yeah...

00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:30.800
You're right...

00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:33.760
So why did you

00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:35.480
call us in today...

00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:38.760
Got a new project

00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:40.400
to talk about. Sit.

00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:46.720
Daoqi, I know

00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:48.440
you're

00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:50.120
scared of heights,

00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:51.320
but you still

00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:53.120
rode coasters with me.

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:54.560
Know what that means?

00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:55.960
What does it mean?

00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:58.280
It means you've got guts,

00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:00.200
drive. I like that.

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:03.640
And Dr. Fu,

00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:05.240
like I said before,

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:06.640
everything about you,

00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:08.560
your whole story, fascinating!

00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:10.960
If you guys are in,

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:12.319
I'll back you.

00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:14.079
Let's launch

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:15.400
a new cosmetics brand.

00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:17.599
We'll call it

00:17:18.599 --> 00:17:19.319
"Dr. Fu"!

00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:26.560
Top school, overseas PhD,

00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:29.600
ten-year experience of developing

00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:31.120
products

00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:32.840
for big cosmetics companies!

00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:36.240
Just look at you, Dr. Fu!

00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:38.080
With your good looks,

00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:39.320
you're perfect

00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:40.480
to be the face

00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:42.320
of your own brand!

00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:44.320
You're a walking brand.

00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:47.160
Mr. Xing, I told you that

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:47.880
I don't have

00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:49.200
ten years of R&D experience,

00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:51.160
just ten years in renovation.

00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:53.040
That's exactly what I want.

00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:56.040
You kept a low profile abroad,

00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:57.200
clean record.

00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:59.160
You're perfect for packaging.

00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:01.440
Isn't that fraud?

00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:04.040
How?

00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:06.080
You can't put it that way.

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:08.960
Product marketing is just storytelling.

00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:10.240
Haven't you heard?

00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:13.240
Wait.

00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:15.120
Hold on.

00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:17.400
Mr. Xing,

00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:19.520
what I really want to know is

00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:20.160
how

00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:23.400
exactly do you want to

00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:24.760
work with us?

00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:26.680
I'm inviting you

00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:28.280
to join our company

00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:29.680
and work with us.

00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:31.640
But the company's partners

00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:34.160
are me and Dr. Fu.

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:36.680
I fund it, he's the image.

00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:40.080
What about me?

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:42.120
Am I just supposed to

00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:43.320
go along with this risky ride?

00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:45.360
How is it a risky ride?

00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:46.640
You provide the labor.

00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:48.040
Labor?

00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:50.880
Money, image, labor.

00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:01.280
I think it's worth discussing.

00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:02.240
On the way,

00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:03.160
let's talk it over.

00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:06.480
What's wrong? Let's go.

00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:07.840
I just remembered

00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:08.640
I have something to do.

00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:10.280
What is it?

00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:12.440
Get in, I'll give you a ride.

00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:14.400
No need, I'll walk.

00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:18.400
What's wrong?

00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:22.640
If you don't like Xing Kai,

00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:24.200
many other investors are waiting for us.

00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:26.040
Besides, I felt like

00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:27.920
Xing Kai really appreciates you.

00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:32.760
I don't think it's me he appreciates.

00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:35.560
Drive carefully!

00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:42.520
Is this the doctor's pride

00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:43.520
acting up again?

00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:47.280
I don't get it.

00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:55.120
Dad.

00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:56.720
Mom.

00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:50.240
Fu Yudong!

00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:55.160
Why are you selecting pots?

00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:56.440
We haven't bought half the stuff yet.

00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:57.360
Let's go, hurry up.

00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:58.920
Your mom asked for it.

00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:00.440
She sent photos to the group chat.

00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:01.920
This cast iron pot

00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:03.680
is expensive, heavy, and impractical.

00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:05.280
If you buy it,

00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:06.920
I won't even know where to put it.

00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:08.640
You'd have to oil it daily.

00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:10.360
It'll just gather dust.

00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:18.680
Amanda.

00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:20.520
Happy birthday.

00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:24.480
I think my birthday was last month.

00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:25.400
I know.

00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:26.840
The thing is, I was busy.

00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:28.480
So this is to make up for it.

00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:29.760
Open it and take a look.

00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:35.560
So?

00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:36.640
Do you like it?

00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:41.880
It's beautiful.

00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:44.040
Thank you.

00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:47.720
But actually,

00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:49.080
you keep giving me

00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:50.720
all these expensive jewels,

00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:52.360
but I never get to wear them.

00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:55.200
So...

00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:56.360
I hope that

00:23:56.360 --> 00:23:58.280
next time you give me something,

00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:00.120
it's something

00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:02.800
I can actually wear.

00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:15.800
Actually,

00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:18.480
I told you a long time ago.

00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:20.600
I really don't have

00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:22.080
any plans to get married again.

00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:26.960
I've waited for you for eight years.

00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:30.480
I know.

00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:33.840
But it's just

00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:34.920
a piece of paper.

00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:37.920
What does it even mean?

00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:41.200
It makes no difference to me.

00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:43.640
What matters most

00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:46.760
is when we're together,

00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:48.160
we feel happy,

00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:49.480
and joyful.

00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:50.920
Isn't that good?

00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:53.840
I really hope

00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:56.160
we can just keep

00:24:56.560 --> 00:24:58.640
being happy.

00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:00.040
Don't you think?

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:15.800
I already told you

00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:17.200
this is my job!

00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:19.160
Why can't you understand?

00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:20.600
How am I supposed to?

00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:22.360
We all need to save face.

00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:23.360
You're shameless,

00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:23.960
but I have to

00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:24.960
save mine.

00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:25.880
How am I shameless?

00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:27.200
You're being so harsh!

00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:28.400
Did I break the law?

00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:29.640
What did I do?

00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:30.880
What more do you want?

00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:31.800
I'm talking about myself,

00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:32.840
not you!

00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:34.680
Were you born in a rock?

00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:35.560
Aren't you my daughter?

00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:36.680
Everyone at the sugar factory knows

00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:38.240
my daughter is Zhang Ran!

00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:39.680
You're so amazing!

00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:40.920
I don't know what kind of daughter

00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:41.760
you wanted to raise!

00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:42.400
I don't get it!

00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:43.600
Should I just move out?

00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:44.360
Here you go again!

00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:46.120
Are you trying to scare me?

00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:47.560
This never ends!

00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:50.400
You're in a little safe haven.

00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:51.800
Dad.

00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:53.600
I can't outargue you.

00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:55.640
You're the OG at this!

00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:08.040
I saw that livestream.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:10.240
It hasn't been easy for you.

00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:14.400
As the old saying goes...

00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:15.920
A man needs to know

00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:17.880
when to give and take.

00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:20.880
I totally get you.

00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:23.280
Thanks, Dad.

00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:26.960
I saw you checking flights earlier.

00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:30.160
Are you going back to Canada?

00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:34.560
The renovation crew in Canada

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:36.240
has a project that needs me.

00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:37.200
I'm thinking of going back.

00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:40.160
So you'll be living apart?

00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:41.560
Don't follow your aunt

00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:42.800
and uncle's example!

00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:44.680
Even the best couples,

00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:47.120
if they can't see each other all year,

00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:49.040
are bound to fall apart!

00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:51.400
Dad,

00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:53.640
I'll just go for a few months.

00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:56.320
If you go back alone,

00:26:56.560 --> 00:26:57.720
does Ran agree?

00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:01.360
She...

00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:03.520
She should be okay with it.

00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:04.800
The main thing is, I'm here

00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:06.040
but I can't really do much.

00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:07.160
I just end up in the way.

00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:08.600
If I go to Canada,

00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:09.600
at least I can

00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:11.520
make some money.

00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:12.800
And if Zhang Ran

00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:14.080
runs into any problems,

00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:15.360
I can at least have her back.

00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:19.480
That makes sense,

00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:21.520
but you must

00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:22.640
talk it through with Ran.

00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:24.320
Think it over.

00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:25.520
For married couples,

00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:27.400
if you can avoid living apart,

00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:29.480
definitely don't do it!

00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:39.360
Zhang Jianbin!

00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:40.480
Get over here!

00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:44.640
Dad, I'll go.

00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:48.480
Anyone who goes is in trouble.

00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:00.920
What?

00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:01.960
What?

00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:04.080
Get out, I need to go in.

00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:05.000
I was here first!

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:06.280
Let me in.

00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:07.600
Hurry.

00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:09.480
You're...

00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:09.880
Hurry!

00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:10.400
I...

00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:15.320
Fu Yudong!

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:16.600
I'm here.

00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:30.960
Zhang Jianbin,

00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:33.800
I don't think you can stay there all day!

00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:36.440
About the video clip,

00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:37.920
let me explain.

00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:39.760
I heard everything.

00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:42.840
It's all for work.

00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:45.560
That day, actually,

00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:46.640
during my livestream,

00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:48.160
Yuan Yuan burst in.

00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:49.120
It's fine.

00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:52.680
I understand.

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:54.240
I didn't take it seriously.

00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:55.120
Actually, I wanted

00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:55.800
to discuss with you...

00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:56.760
I

00:28:58.120 --> 00:28:59.640
want to go back to Canada.

00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:01.640
The thing is, being here,

00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:02.600
I feel like right now

00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:03.760
I don't have much to do.

00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:06.560
If I go to Canada,

00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:08.200
at least I can make some money.

00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:14.280
Can you stay?

00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:16.200
What could I even do?

00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:25.760
Give it some more thought.

00:29:58.560 --> 00:29:59.120
By the way,

00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:00.520
why did you suddenly

00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:01.520
come to Lucheng?

00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:03.280
I remember

00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:04.560
you don't have business here.

00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:07.400
I don't.

00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:08.720
Can't I just come see you for dinner?

00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:14.400
When are you leaving?

00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:20.280
Do you remember the time

00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:23.360
in Norway,

00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:24.880
when we went fishing?

00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:26.680
I remember

00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:30.000
we had the captain catch the fish

00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:31.560
and cook it for you right away.

00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:34.600
I'm sure you remember

00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:36.240
how that fish tasted.

00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:41.520
I do.

00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:43.320
Of course I do.

00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:45.880
So if I get the chance,

00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:48.280
I plan to take my husband

00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:49.240
and child

00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:50.440
back to Norway.

00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:56.000
Do you remember

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:57.880
John Singer Sargent?

00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:00.800
He has an exhibition in Boston.

00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:02.120
Are you going to see it?

00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:08.360
Now most of my time

00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:10.320
is spent on my child.

00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:13.120
The paintings I see most

00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:14.960
are my son's.

00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:17.440
My life's

00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:19.840
changed.

00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:33.360
Are you happy now?

00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:35.240
Are you content?

00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:37.640
Is this what you've

00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:38.680
been chasing for?

00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:48.120
Do you think I'm unhappy?

00:31:49.680 --> 00:31:50.960
I'm very happy.

00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:53.200
This life

00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:54.640
is exactly what I've always

00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:55.800
wanted.

00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:19.600
Is it good?

00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:20.520
It is.

00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:22.280
These baby carrots are pretty sweet.

00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:25.760
Delicious.

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:37.640
By the way,

00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:39.040
do you need a ride home?

00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:40.560
After all, we all drank.

00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:43.640
We live pretty close.

00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:46.000
We can walk or take a cab.

00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:49.080
You're still the same.

00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:50.560
When you go out to eat and drink,

00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:51.680
you don't drive.

00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:54.600
Oh,

00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:56.120
your agent told me you helped him

00:32:57.120 --> 00:32:58.480
at his company,

00:32:58.480 --> 00:32:59.840
with real estate development.

00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:01.280
He said he gave you

00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:02.160
a great deal.

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:06.400
I didn't go through him to buy my house.

00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:08.400
I know.

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:15.760
You go ahead.

00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:17.680
We'll take some pictures.

00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:20.320
Nice to meet you.

00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:20.960
You too.

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:25.560
Take care.

00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:32.440
Let's take a photo.

00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:36.120
Let's take some photos.

00:33:36.520 --> 00:33:37.440
Photo, okay!

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:39.680
Here.

00:33:56.760 --> 00:33:57.440
Let's...

00:33:58.400 --> 00:33:59.320
Go home.

00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:16.679
Daoqi,

00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:18.400
how we are now

00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:19.320
is really great.

00:34:20.199 --> 00:34:21.239
We have food and drink,

00:34:21.679 --> 00:34:22.920
our life is secure.

00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:25.560
Nian's recent test scores

00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:26.639
have been improving.

00:34:26.639 --> 00:34:27.199
Really?

00:34:28.719 --> 00:34:30.280
Now we both have time

00:34:30.719 --> 00:34:31.920
to spend more with him at home.

00:34:32.199 --> 00:34:33.679
He'll definitely get better.

00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:38.600
Daoqi,

00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:41.280
I've always hoped for

00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:42.840
a home of my own.

00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:46.000
I'm glad I met you.

00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:48.040
Me too.

00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:50.040
Really.

00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:52.600
Me too.

00:34:55.040 --> 00:34:55.719
Don't worry.

00:34:56.719 --> 00:34:57.760
Things will get better.

00:34:59.160 --> 00:34:59.920
Trust me.

00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:01.800
Only better.

00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:13.760
What's with you today?

00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:14.680
You seem off.

00:35:15.560 --> 00:35:16.720
Nothing, I'm fine.

00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:19.720
Then why are you spacing out?

00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:24.800
Cheng Man and I

00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:26.960
had dinner with her ex.

00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:29.280
Who?

00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:30.920
Cheng Man's ex.

00:35:32.680 --> 00:35:34.960
Did you know about him before?

00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:37.120
I did, but I'd never met him.

00:35:37.960 --> 00:35:38.720
It's the first time.

00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:40.600
Not what I expected.

00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:42.400
I thought he'd be a nouveau riche.

00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:43.360
He's not.

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:44.800
He's polite.

00:35:45.560 --> 00:35:46.600
Gracious.

00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:49.080
Knows his limits.

00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:50.440
Refined.

00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:52.360
Charismatic.

00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:54.560
He seemed

00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:56.280
pretty comfortable to be around.

00:35:57.640 --> 00:35:58.760
Listening to them talk,

00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:01.560
for ages,

00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:03.520
I only caught half of it.

00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:06.040
At first it felt awkward,

00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:07.520
but then I just sat there

00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:08.640
listening to them chat.

00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:09.400
As I listened,

00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:10.440
I got drawn in.

00:36:11.320 --> 00:36:12.480
It felt like when I was a kid

00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:13.480
sitting in front of the TV,

00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:15.720
watching Hong Kong dramas.

00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:18.640
I just feel like Cheng Man and I

00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:22.760
aren't from the same world.

00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:26.000
Did you feel

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:27.000
a bit out of place?

00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:30.880
Maybe.

00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:34.160
Can't quite put my finger on it.

00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:36.640
Here's to the odd one out!

00:36:44.920 --> 00:36:45.760
I think

00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:48.640
the fact that Cheng Man brought you

00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:49.800
to meet her ex,

00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:51.440
at least shows she's

00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:52.480
being open with you.

00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:53.280
Yeah.

00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:54.640
So don't overthink it.

00:36:56.320 --> 00:36:56.760
Yeah.

00:36:57.480 --> 00:36:59.080
My wife is beyond reproach.

00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:01.800
You know what?

00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:03.840
Before Cheng Man married me,

00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:06.120
she used to love skiing,

00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:08.720
playing golf,

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:10.040
tennis,

00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:12.480
and traveling.

00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:14.640
Worldwide,

00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:16.440
she's probably

00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:18.600
been to half the countries.

00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:21.160
After marrying me, I haven't

00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:24.440
taken her abroad.

00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:25.360
Not even once.

00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:28.440
So tell me,

00:37:32.240 --> 00:37:34.160
what does she see in me?

00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:35.280
How did she end up

00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:36.840
with me?

00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:38.520
That's because,

00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:39.520
in her eyes,

00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:41.720
you have qualities

00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:43.280
that others don't.

00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:44.840
Like...

00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:47.400
Like what?

00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:58.160
Does it take this long?

00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:00.920
Your strength is

00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:03.400
you have no flaws.

00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:06.280
I'm being serious here!

00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:07.320
Really! In my eyes,

00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:08.400
you have no flaws.

00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:09.280
Otherwise,

00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:10.200
why would I only hang out with you

00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:11.200
and not anyone else?

00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:17.440
I have no flaws.

00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:20.520
If you put it that way...

00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:22.200
I've been thinking forever

00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:23.240
and I can't come up with that!

00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:25.400
But if you insist,

00:38:25.400 --> 00:38:26.560
I guess there's one.

00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:27.760
What?

00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:29.840
That you're all strengths.

00:38:32.840 --> 00:38:34.840
Yeah, really.

00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:35.520
Alright.

00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:37.000
Stop

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:37.880
consoling yourself.

00:38:37.880 --> 00:38:38.440
Let me tell you,

00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:40.600
everyone has flaws,

00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:43.320
and everyone has strengths.

00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:45.560
The people around you...

00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:47.640
It depends on whether they see your flaws

00:38:47.640 --> 00:38:48.760
or your strengths.

00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:50.240
But I think Cheng Man

00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:51.360
has always seen your strengths.

00:40:44.120 --> 00:40:45.560
Why are you calling me?

00:40:46.760 --> 00:40:47.760
Where's your beard?

00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:50.200
You're pretty handsome without it.

00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:52.320
I saw a plastic bag.

00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:54.960
The wind blew

00:40:55.520 --> 00:40:56.760
and it flew up into the sky.

00:40:58.160 --> 00:40:59.680
Left, then right,

00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:01.280
up, then down.

00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:04.840
I was thinking,

00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:07.720
does it know

00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:08.920
that it's flying

00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:11.000
because of the wind,

00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:14.120
or does it think

00:41:14.120 --> 00:41:15.240
it can fly on its own?

00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:18.960
When the wind stops,

00:41:20.560 --> 00:41:21.800
the bag falls to the ground

00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:25.120
and gets stepped on.

00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:29.200
Nobody cares about it,

00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:33.440
because it's just a trash bag.

00:41:36.520 --> 00:41:37.320
What's wrong?

00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:40.920
Many people and events

00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:43.480
just happen to cross paths.

00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:46.520
There's no such thing as destiny.

00:41:49.480 --> 00:41:51.040
Others rarely care.

00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:53.920
"Going with the flow"

00:41:53.920 --> 00:41:55.000
sounds nice,

00:41:56.440 --> 00:41:57.240
but actually

00:41:57.240 --> 00:41:58.760
it's just drifting along.

00:42:02.080 --> 00:42:03.080
I think

00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:05.040
the wind

00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:06.280
is out of the bag's control.

00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:08.080
The only thing it can control

00:42:08.080 --> 00:42:08.880
is that

00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:11.840
no matter how much it gets stepped on,

00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:13.760
it shouldn't see itself as a trash bag.

00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:16.120
That's the key.

00:42:16.360 --> 00:42:17.480
In others' eyes,

00:42:17.560 --> 00:42:18.720
it's just a trash bag.

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:19.920
It can hold anything.

00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:22.080
Sure.

00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:24.320
[But at least it should know]

00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:25.240
[it's still useful.]

00:42:28.760 --> 00:42:29.840
[Let me tell you something.]

00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:31.320
[When are you]

00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:32.360
[coming back to Canada?]

00:42:32.440 --> 00:42:33.680
[If you don't come back soon,]

00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:34.360
[when you're back]

00:42:34.360 --> 00:42:35.360
[you won't see me here.]

00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:36.440
What are you doing?

00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:38.480
[I've already decided.]

00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:41.120
[I'm done doing]

00:42:41.120 --> 00:42:42.240
[renovations in Canada.]

00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:43.760
It's meaningless to me.

00:42:44.360 --> 00:42:45.400
I'm going back to filmmaking,

00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:47.480
because it's

00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:49.800
the only thing in my life

00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:51.000
that truly makes me happy.

00:42:52.840 --> 00:42:54.240
[I don't care what they think of me.]

00:42:54.600 --> 00:42:55.240
[If they think]

00:42:55.240 --> 00:42:56.480
[I wasn't good before,]

00:42:57.160 --> 00:42:58.240
I can start over.

00:42:59.320 --> 00:43:00.800
Either way, I'm going to make

00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:01.840
a great film.

00:43:05.240 --> 00:43:06.400
[Congratulations, Zhihao.]

00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:09.200
You can be yourself again.

00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:10.200
You can go do

00:43:10.200 --> 00:43:11.440
what you love.

00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:13.160
Just do it!

00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:17.680
A while back,

00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:19.960
at a secondhand market,

00:43:20.160 --> 00:43:21.520
I saw a DVD player.

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:24.040
I thought about it,

00:43:25.120 --> 00:43:26.520
[but I ended up buying it.]

00:43:27.640 --> 00:43:28.880
[You know what I was thinking?]

00:43:29.520 --> 00:43:30.880
Back then,

00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:33.000
we had you, me, and the DVDs,

00:43:33.760 --> 00:43:35.000
but no DVD player.

00:43:36.040 --> 00:43:38.720
Now I have me, the DVDs,

00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:39.720
and a DVD player,

00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:41.920
but not you.

00:43:46.720 --> 00:43:47.280
It's okay.

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:49.360
When your film

00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:50.720
wins the biggest

00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:52.320
international award,

00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:53.800
invite me and I'll be there.

00:43:54.080 --> 00:43:55.800
I'll be at the premiere!

00:43:58.400 --> 00:44:00.400
It's a deal.

00:44:02.080 --> 00:44:03.080
Alright, Zhihao.

00:44:03.960 --> 00:44:04.760
I'll let you go.

00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:05.960
Work on your script.

00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:08.640
Zhihao,

00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:11.640
being able to call you

00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:13.640
makes me really happy.

00:44:14.560 --> 00:44:15.520
[Getting your call]

00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:16.400
[makes me really happy too.]

00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:18.880
You've got this.
