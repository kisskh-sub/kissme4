[Episode 20]

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:41.660
The restaurant's food

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.020
is no match for Ms. Wen's cooking.

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:45.770
It's so salty.

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:47.410
They broke up,

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:48.660
and we suffer.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.290
Do you really like Ms. Wen a lot?

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.980
Definitely.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.490
But can't show it to Dad.

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:08.780
The grown-ups' feelings
are unpredictable.

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.170
As she

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:14.780
didn't become your mom,

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:16.850
are you really disappointed?

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:18.380
Not really.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.890
Grandma,

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:21.410
Dad likes

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:22.500
what he likes.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.500
I like what I like.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.980
My dad's feelings come first.

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.500
Mine come after.

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:31.260
I'm easygoing.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.780
There's a package for you.

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:41.100
For me?

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:45.170
You haven't finished eating yet.

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.780
Grandma, I'm full.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:49.410
A figure.

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.500
Who sent this to me?

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:52.850
I didn't buy anything.

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.780
Strange.

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.780
I got it.

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.780
I'll do my homework in my room.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.660
I also think the gaming industry

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:10.290
is promising.

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:12.890
Hope we'll collaborate in the future.

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:14.780
Real estate should be viable.

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:16.260
Yes.

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.690
Let me properly introduce you now.

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:19.410
Zu

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.130
is the President
of Shengnuo Real Estate,

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:23.260
and I'm

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.890
the Project Manager
of the East District

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:26.780
Sports Industry Park project.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.410
Without any experience in real estate,

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.780
can you handle this big project

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.660
right off the bat?

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.130
Although she has no experience,

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:35.500
she has provided us

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:36.660
with very valuable advice.

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:38.730
And if she hadn't had the capability,

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:40.780
I wouldn't have made her
my project manager,

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:41.290
would I?

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.890
So your company got that land?

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:45.290
It's my friend's company.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.340
Your friend's company got the land

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.890
and let you develop it?

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:50.130
We're developing it jointly.

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:51.610
Developing the old district

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:52.780
involves a lot of things.

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:55.260
It'll take a long time to get approvals,

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.500
yet you've started planning already?

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:58.980
Seems you know quite a bit about it.

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:00.660
My friend's company has taken care

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.260
of these tedious procedures,

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:04.130
Shuhan can just get right to work.

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:07.980
Seems your business is doing very well.

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:11.380
Cut it out.

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:12.980
What's with all the questions?

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.820
Besides,

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:15.290
the project is not that big.

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:16.410
What makes you think I can't handle it?

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:18.900
After all, I was quite a big shot

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:20.610
in East District back in the day.

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.660
I can get it done

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.250
with just a few phone calls.

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:25.370
You're worrying over nothing.

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:26.900
Real estate isn't as easy

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:28.490
to make money in as it used to be.

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.100
But if it can improve

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.460
people's quality of life,

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:33.140
there will be business opportunities.

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:37.020
You really have great taste,

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:39.140
especially in choosing an amazing girl

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:40.100
to be your girlfriend.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.730
I wish my bestie

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:43.900
everlasting happiness.

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:45.900
But I must make one thing clear.

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.100
Don't bully her.

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:49.370
If you mistreat her,

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:51.290
we won't let you get away with it.

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:52.900
Of course.

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.410
Cheers!

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:00.140
Is he a decent guy?

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.140
Can't say it here?

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:03.100
Let's talk about it later.

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:16.290
Ms. Tan,

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:18.370
is the street dance figure from you?

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:21.370
Do you like it?

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:23.250
Yes.

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:24.660
Thank you.

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:35.780
Stop playing.

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:37.140
Go do your homework.

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:38.250
If I catch you playing,

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:39.780
I'll confiscate all of them.

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:41.850
Be self-disciplined.

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:08.050
Le,

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:10.100
hurry up.

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:15.980
Sweetheart,

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:17.700
wake up.

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:19.610
Did you hear me?

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:20.370
Come on.

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:20.980
Get up.

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:22.580
Quickly.

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:24.050
Come on.

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:26.250
Go.

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:48.100
Enough with this.

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:50.370
Now is not the time.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:52.980
It's okay.

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:53.850
It's a holiday today.

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:54.850
Besides,

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:57.580
he'll have less time with this
in middle school.

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:00.100
Who is spoiling him now?

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:03.980
You're good in every way,

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:06.340
except for your studies.

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:09.460
Your father was an excellent student.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.140
I never had to worry about him.

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:13.580
I wonder who you take after.

00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:16.580
Grades aren't everything.

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:20.460
I think he's doing well in all aspects.

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:22.220
My dad is the best.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.100
Have you done your homework?

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:27.250
Grandma,

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:30.020
please don't start the day with this.

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:32.460
It affects my mood.

00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:35.220
I finished it all last night.

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:36.490
You even checked it.

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:38.140
Nonsense!

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:40.250
When did I ever check it?

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:41.220
Dad,

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:43.610
didn't she check my homework yesterday?

00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:47.100
Alright.

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:49.220
I'll help you check it from now on.

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:01.730
Here.

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:04.140
Eat this piece too.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.340
Still one in my hand.

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:09.250
Eat this piece too.

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:11.700
I've never eaten two pieces.

00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:15.340
But today is a special case.

00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:20.850
Alright, Mr. Wang.

00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:21.340
That's all.

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:23.220
We'll be in touch when needed.

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:30.140
When did you come in?

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:31.490
You didn't make a sound.

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:32.700
What's happening?

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:33.340
You look so happy.

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:34.490
Guess

00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:36.060
how much funding our sports park project

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:36.770
has secured.

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:39.420
For this project,

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:42.700
the first round should be
at least 20 million.

00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:45.490
Fifty million?

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:46.650
Eighty million.

00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:49.850
Eighty million?

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:53.340
Eighty million in the first round?

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:54.890
Not enough.

00:08:55.510 --> 00:08:56.340
I've decided to take out

00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:58.130
some more loans from the bank.

00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:00.770
Sun just called me

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:01.490
and said the investors

00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:03.220
are optimistic
about this park's prospects.

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:06.700
Of course, the returns will be high.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.730
Or they wouldn't have invested readily.

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:11.130
Zu,

00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:13.250
I also think this project is quite good.

00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:14.420
Should we

00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:16.700
invest a bit ourselves?

00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:17.460
No.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:18.490
Remember,

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:19.850
unless it's necessary,

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.060
never touch your own available funds.

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:23.700
A company will be

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:24.980
in danger at a time like this

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.180
if it runs out of cash flow.

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:28.980
You're the business pro here.

00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:29.980
I'll listen to you.

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:36.610
So you'd like to order more

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:38.420
of our new Pinot Noir from this year?

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:39.940
How about ten cases?

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:40.850
Ten cases?

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:41.490
Alright.

00:09:41.510 --> 00:09:42.420
I can offer

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:44.180
a better price.

00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:45.100
Great.

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:45.700
That should be all.

00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:47.220
I'll have my colleague assist you.

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:47.890
Okay.

00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:48.700
Qi,

00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:50.490
please handle this.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:51.460
Sure thing.

00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:51.940
Okay.

00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:53.420
Just one moment, please.

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:54.100
Three bottles, right?

00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:54.490
Yes.

00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:54.890
Okay.

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:55.890
Sir,

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:57.940
let me double-check the order details

00:09:58.150 --> 00:09:58.940
with you.

00:09:58.960 --> 00:09:59.420
Hello.

00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:00.980
What are we having for lunch today?

00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:02.420
Sorry,

00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:03.490
I've got plans for lunch today.

00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:05.130
With who?

00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:06.700
Le.

00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:08.250
He texted me this morning,

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:09.700
saying he wants to grab lunch.

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:11.790
[Cygne]

00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:12.370
Le.

00:10:12.510 --> 00:10:12.940
What to eat?

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:14.370
I booked a table at the pizza place.

00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:15.420
Want to join?

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:19.460
I...

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:21.460
No,

00:10:21.790 --> 00:10:23.700
I'll leave you two to your lunch.

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:26.490
I get the feeling

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:28.980
that someone's stealing you
away from me,

00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:32.700
Come over to my place tonight.

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:34.220
Okay, see you tonight.

00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:36.460
Bye.

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:19.010
He's arrived.

00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:21.420
Ask Mr. Zhang to wait

00:11:21.630 --> 00:11:22.220
for a moment.

00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:23.850
I'll grab something from home.

00:11:24.910 --> 00:11:25.420
Fifteen minutes.

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:26.730
Okay.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:29.980
Alright. I'll be right back.

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:32.300
Le, why are you still at home?

00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:34.130
It's the weekend.

00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:35.010
Where should I be?

00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:37.650
I thought you were having lunch
with Ms. Tan today.

00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:38.770
No.

00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:40.420
When?

00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:43.010
But she called me and said

00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:44.420
you were going to eat pizza.

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:45.300
No.

00:11:45.910 --> 00:11:46.420
No?

00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:51.300
Congratulations.

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:54.700
Rui is back by your side.

00:11:55.670 --> 00:11:57.130
"Back" is the wrong word.

00:11:58.120 --> 00:11:59.370
He has always been by my side.

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:04.130
Please stay away from Le.

00:12:04.910 --> 00:12:06.060
As his grandma,

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:07.890
you're asking his mother

00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:09.530
to stay away from him.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.730
Have you fulfilled your duty
as a mother?

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:13.130
It's because of you.

00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:13.890
Enough.

00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:16.730
Stop playing the victim.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.370
We never forced you.

00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:20.460
Back then,

00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:21.980
you chose to go to Paris

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.340
for your own career.

00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:25.010
Le

00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:27.610
is at a crucial stage in his studies.

00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:29.700
Must you influence him at this time?

00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:30.730
When to tell him

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:32.220
is my right as his mother.

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:33.300
Don't worry about it.

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:35.610
What you should be worried about is

00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:36.650
what if Le finds out

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:38.420
that the grandma he loves most

00:12:38.750 --> 00:12:39.940
kept us apart for 12 years?

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:40.730
It doesn't matter.

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:42.130
Go ahead and tell him

00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:47.890
if you want to watch him suffer.

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:50.460
When you all forced me to leave,

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:52.100
why didn't you ever consider

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:53.940
that Le would suffer like this today?

00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:56.370
As long as I'm alive,

00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:58.180
I will always be his mother.

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:05.850
Tan Siting,

00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:09.460
don't think that, as you've won Rui,

00:13:09.630 --> 00:13:10.940
you can marry him.

00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:13.940
Let me tell you frankly,

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:15.610
I will never agree.

00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:16.700
The Gao family

00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:18.010
will never agree.

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:19.770
You're too confident.

00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:22.460
Marriage is a matter
between Feng Rui and me.

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:24.180
As for your Gao family...

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:25.850
Honestly,

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:27.890
do you think I'd want to marry

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:31.940
into the family of a rapist?

00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:39.060
Perfect.

00:13:40.630 --> 00:13:42.370
We don't want Rui to marry

00:13:43.150 --> 00:13:45.180
the daughter of a murderer.

00:13:59.240 --> 00:13:59.650
Mom.

00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:05.460
Just the right time.

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:07.220
You may

00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:09.220
stay away from her

00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:11.370
or from us.

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:13.460
You think I don't know

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:16.460
what you two did

00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:18.370
behind my back.

00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:38.010
It'll probably be harder

00:14:38.270 --> 00:14:39.420
for me to see Le.

00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:02.980
Hello, Ms. Hu.

00:15:03.390 --> 00:15:03.650
Hello.

00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:04.460
Something came up at home,

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:06.980
so I came to pick him up early.

00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:07.980
It's okay.

00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:10.730
Remember to turn in
your activity class homework tomorrow.

00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:12.300
Go back with your grandma.

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:13.130
Okay.

00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:15.370
Alright.

00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:15.940
Ms. Hu,

00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:16.610
we're leaving now.

00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:17.370
Goodbye, Ms. Hu.

00:15:17.390 --> 00:15:17.890
Bye-bye.

00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:18.460
Bye-bye.

00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:19.890
Take care.

00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:26.130
Grandma,

00:15:26.510 --> 00:15:28.610
why did you pick me up so early today?

00:15:32.390 --> 00:15:33.650
Your great-grandpa misses you

00:15:34.630 --> 00:15:35.700
and wants to eat with you.

00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:39.300
Your great-grandfather's
is too far away.

00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:40.940
Come home with me

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.370
tonight.

00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:45.650
What about my dad?

00:15:46.390 --> 00:15:47.460
He's been busy lately.

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:49.420
For these few days,

00:15:49.750 --> 00:15:50.610
you'll stay with me.

00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:55.850
What has Dad been doing recently?

00:15:57.120 --> 00:15:58.700
It's like he's vanished!

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:02.200
He was never like this when busy.

00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:05.640
Has something happened?

00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:07.160
No, that's not right.

00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:09.870
He just broke up with Ms. Wen

00:16:09.870 --> 00:16:11.950
and is already dating someone else.

00:16:12.630 --> 00:16:14.160
Isn't that a bit too fast?

00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:18.160
It can't be.

00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:24.460
Mr. Lu bought them for you.

00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:26.130
Thank you, Mr. Lu.

00:16:26.670 --> 00:16:27.700
You're welcome.

00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:31.980
Grandma,

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:35.730
are you giving me a break today?

00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:37.220
No more vocabulary drills?

00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:39.180
Rest helps studying.

00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:43.130
Might I play for a bit
at great-grandpa's place?

00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:44.370
Yes.

00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:45.490
Go all out.

00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:53.480
Goodbye.

00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:54.320
Goodbye, miss.

00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:55.470
Students in the first row,

00:16:55.470 --> 00:16:57.110
have you seen your parents?

00:16:57.320 --> 00:16:58.680
Yes.

00:16:58.710 --> 00:16:59.360
Go on.

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:00.760
Bye.

00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:01.920
Bye.

00:17:14.340 --> 00:17:15.940
Ms. Hu, have you seen Feng Lexuan?

00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:18.460
He left a while ago.

00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:20.180
His grandma picked him up early.

00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:21.180
I see.

00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:21.780
Thanks.

00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:31.780
What's wrong?

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:32.780
Where's Le?

00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:34.700
My mom picked him up.

00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:35.940
I called her, but she didn't answer.

00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:38.180
So what should we do?

00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:40.500
Let's go to my mom's place.

00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:48.260
Grandpa.

00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:48.980
Hello, Le.

00:17:50.140 --> 00:17:50.900
Let me get that for you. Here.

00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:56.420
Grandma said Great-grandpa missed me,

00:17:56.740 --> 00:17:57.940
and he wanted me to eat with him.

00:17:58.740 --> 00:17:59.220
Grandpa,

00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:00.500
did you miss me?

00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:01.300
Of course I did.

00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:03.220
It's been a while, little buddy.

00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:04.100
Go on inside.

00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:04.820
Great-grandpa's waiting for you.

00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:05.300
Okay!

00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:09.860
Haven't brought Le over
for dinner for ages.

00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:11.820
A friend happened to send some beef.

00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:13.180
Ask Ms. Ming to cook it up.

00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:13.820
Okay.

00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:17.820
Le, have some beef.

00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:18.780
Eat more beef.

00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:19.580
That's right.

00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:20.140
Beef helps you grow strong.

00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:21.060
Thank you, Great-grandpa.

00:18:21.620 --> 00:18:22.620
Broccoli.

00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:25.700
Here,

00:18:26.380 --> 00:18:26.980
eat this.

00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:28.660
Steamed chicken with chili oil.

00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:37.220
No one's at home.

00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:38.980
Where could they be?

00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:40.820
Let me think.

00:18:53.460 --> 00:18:54.100
Rui.

00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:54.860
Hello, Dad.

00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:56.940
Are Mom and Le with you?

00:18:57.660 --> 00:18:58.020
Yes.

00:18:58.420 --> 00:18:59.020
We're having dinner.

00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:00.460
I got it.

00:19:00.540 --> 00:19:00.820
Well.

00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:02.180
I'll head over now.

00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:07.300
My mom took Le to my grandpa's house.

00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:11.020
I should have guessed

00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:12.460
things wouldn't be that simple.

00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:14.060
I didn't expect

00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:15.460
my mom to act so quickly.

00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:18.780
Do you think

00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:20.380
we should tell Le the truth

00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:22.380
as soon as possible

00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:23.500
instead of delaying?

00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:24.780
It really is time.

00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:27.220
It's okay.

00:19:27.820 --> 00:19:28.820
I'll drive you to your meeting.

00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:30.460
Leave it to me.

00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:31.780
Here.

00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:42.300
Feng Rui will be here in a bit.

00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:45.180
Tell Ms. Ming to save some food for him.

00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:49.380
Here, Le, eat.

00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:52.300
Try some chicken.

00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:56.300
No more room on the plate.

00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:07.300
The viewership of Ms. Tan's documentary

00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:08.580
has exceeded three million.

00:20:08.620 --> 00:20:10.460
Plus Mr. Yu's recent interview with you,

00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:11.820
my phone

00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:13.500
is ringing off the hook right now.

00:20:13.780 --> 00:20:14.540
So many reporters

00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:15.380
want to know

00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:16.460
when they can schedule

00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:17.500
an exclusive interview with you.

00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:21.220
I feel like I'm not very good

00:20:22.540 --> 00:20:23.220
at interviews.

00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:25.220
The last one

00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:28.300
was to promote our school.

00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:29.580
So…

00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:31.500
Um,

00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:35.300
Ms. Tan doesn't like facing the media.

00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:36.100
Ms. Qin,

00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:37.980
turn down all the interview requests.

00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:41.580
I've been telling them so.

00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:43.980
But they want fairness.

00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:45.820
Coming off as unfair

00:20:45.820 --> 00:20:47.300
is hurting everyone's feelings.

00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:49.060
Ms. Tan,

00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:51.100
you could give them some guidelines

00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:52.220
and set conditions

00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:53.580
before the interviews.

00:20:53.780 --> 00:20:55.700
I'm sure they'll cooperate.

00:20:57.300 --> 00:20:59.020
As your documentary

00:20:59.060 --> 00:21:00.340
is so popular right now,

00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:01.700
ballet is receiving

00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:03.540
unprecedented public attention.

00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:05.020
If we can leverage

00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:06.340
media collaboration now,

00:21:06.860 --> 00:21:08.860
I'm sure it'll be immensely beneficial

00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:10.740
for our school's visibility

00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:12.940
and the promotion of ballet.

00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:17.460
Which media outlets are there now?

00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:20.020
There are

00:21:20.060 --> 00:21:21.060
Comic Weekly,

00:21:21.260 --> 00:21:22.060
the Grand Chronicle,

00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:22.980
Dancer,

00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:24.540
City of Dance,

00:21:24.980 --> 00:21:25.180
and

00:21:25.220 --> 00:21:25.820
A Date with Miracles.

00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:27.500
I think I've seen

00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:28.980
City of Dance before.

00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:31.020
Is it a talk show format?

00:21:31.380 --> 00:21:31.940
Yes.

00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:33.820
The program wants

00:21:33.820 --> 00:21:35.220
to help people learn more

00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:36.500
about various types of dance

00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:37.740
through interviews with professionals

00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:38.620
and rising stars

00:21:38.620 --> 00:21:40.860
in the dance world.

00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:43.820
Seems this program

00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:46.740
aligns well with our original intention.

00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:47.260
Yes.

00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:51.580
If this program lets

00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:53.460
more people understand ballet,

00:21:53.780 --> 00:21:54.740
get to know our school,

00:21:55.260 --> 00:21:56.340
and see so many talented children

00:21:56.340 --> 00:21:57.500
at our school,

00:21:57.740 --> 00:21:59.180
I'll join this program.

00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:00.940
Great!

00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:02.580
I'll contact them right away.

00:22:04.540 --> 00:22:05.620
Let's choose a role.

00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:06.740
Huang.

00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:09.980
Okay?

00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:10.980
Okay.

00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:12.380
Le,

00:22:13.060 --> 00:22:13.580
take a break

00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:15.060
and have some fruit.

00:22:15.780 --> 00:22:16.100
Alright?

00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:17.020
Here,

00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:17.500
have some fruit.

00:22:17.540 --> 00:22:18.300
Give me a sec.

00:22:18.380 --> 00:22:18.860
Stop playing.

00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:19.580
Rui.

00:22:19.780 --> 00:22:20.260
Is everyone here?

00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:20.860
Yes.

00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:23.300
I'm almost done.

00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:24.700
Go.

00:22:24.780 --> 00:22:25.300
Go.

00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:26.780
That's so high!

00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:30.860
Penalty kick!

00:22:32.540 --> 00:22:32.780
Dad.

00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:33.620
Rui.

00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:34.140
Grandpa.

00:22:34.940 --> 00:22:35.220
Dad.

00:22:35.540 --> 00:22:35.900
Le.

00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:36.580
Le,

00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:39.060
it's time to do your homework.

00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:41.100
Ms. Ming,

00:22:42.500 --> 00:22:44.380
take Le upstairs to do his homework.

00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:45.220
Okay.

00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:47.780
Le.

00:22:50.060 --> 00:22:50.540
Go on.

00:22:52.780 --> 00:22:53.060
Dad,

00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:55.460
my good times end when you arrive.

00:23:04.540 --> 00:23:04.780
Mom,

00:23:05.540 --> 00:23:06.220
I need to talk to you.

00:23:19.820 --> 00:23:20.100
Here,

00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:20.740
Le.

00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:21.500
Here.

00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:22.580
Have some water first.

00:23:23.780 --> 00:23:24.780
After Le finishes his homework,

00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:25.780
I'll take him home.

00:23:26.540 --> 00:23:27.060
Stop right there.

00:23:32.860 --> 00:23:34.100
Today, in the presence of your grandpa

00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:35.540
and your dad,

00:23:35.780 --> 00:23:37.020
let's get this straight.

00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:39.780
Dad,

00:23:40.220 --> 00:23:41.780
they're taking Le to France.

00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:47.300
I want the three of us to be together.

00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:48.860
To let Le have an environment

00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:50.060
where he can bond with his mother.

00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:51.420
We could go anywhere.

00:23:51.780 --> 00:23:52.940
Go wherever you want.

00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:54.020
I can't stop you,

00:23:54.060 --> 00:23:55.020
and I won't.

00:23:56.780 --> 00:23:58.100
But I raised Le,

00:23:58.540 --> 00:23:59.740
and he should stay with me.

00:24:00.060 --> 00:24:01.740
You're not taking him away

00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:03.500
unless I'm dead.

00:24:04.020 --> 00:24:05.220
Le needs a mother too.

00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:06.900
For 12 years, he's lived a life

00:24:07.060 --> 00:24:08.540
without a mother by his side.

00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:09.500
Isn't that enough?

00:24:09.740 --> 00:24:10.540
So,

00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:13.700
you want to separate me from him?

00:24:13.860 --> 00:24:15.300
Is this her idea?

00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:17.740
Who caused this situation?

00:24:17.980 --> 00:24:19.180
You know better than anyone.

00:24:24.020 --> 00:24:25.700
If you hadn't deceived us 12 years ago,

00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:26.980
we never would have separated.

00:24:28.060 --> 00:24:29.860
You knew Siting wasn't quite herself,

00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:31.500
yet you lied that the baby was gone.

00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:33.180
Do you know what you did

00:24:33.540 --> 00:24:34.340
was like killing her?

00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:35.540
And

00:24:37.780 --> 00:24:38.300
about Haotian's matter,

00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:39.700
I know you can't move on.

00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:42.860
Why do you have to implicate me?

00:24:43.140 --> 00:24:44.300
Just because he was my uncle?

00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:45.500
He was a rapist!

00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:00.700
Rui,

00:25:01.340 --> 00:25:02.980
you shouldn't have said that.

00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:15.020
Rui,

00:25:15.700 --> 00:25:16.620
it's not your mother's fault.

00:25:17.540 --> 00:25:18.700
Blame me.

00:25:19.260 --> 00:25:20.060
Your separation...

00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:28.380
was caused by me.

00:25:34.820 --> 00:25:35.460
Who are you?

00:25:36.540 --> 00:25:37.980
I'm Feng Rui's father.

00:25:39.540 --> 00:25:40.980
I'm about the same age as your father,

00:25:41.660 --> 00:25:42.780
so I'll call you Ting.

00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:45.860
You're a smart girl,

00:25:46.860 --> 00:25:48.020
I believe you know why I'm here.

00:25:49.460 --> 00:25:51.420
To talk me into breaking up
with Feng Rui?

00:25:54.420 --> 00:25:54.940
In that case,

00:25:54.940 --> 00:25:56.140
we have nothing to talk about.

00:25:57.420 --> 00:25:59.940
You've seen how his mother

00:26:00.860 --> 00:26:01.580
and grandpa feel.

00:26:03.940 --> 00:26:06.060
If you insist on being with him,

00:26:07.180 --> 00:26:08.100
what's your plan?

00:26:09.020 --> 00:26:09.820
When he comes back,

00:26:10.940 --> 00:26:12.100
we'll leave this place.

00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:14.540
Have you thought about where to go?

00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:16.700
France.

00:26:19.540 --> 00:26:20.780
That's a good idea.

00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:22.940
You can continue to dance ballet

00:26:23.460 --> 00:26:25.660
and pursue your dreams.

00:26:26.620 --> 00:26:27.820
To be with him,

00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:30.820
I believe a thoughtful girl like you

00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:32.660
must have considered many things.

00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:34.540
And you might have some heart knots.

00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:37.660
That's why I'm here today

00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:38.860
to share with you

00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:41.060
some of my experiences.

00:26:42.660 --> 00:26:44.060
When I was young,

00:26:44.500 --> 00:26:45.660
I also had to make choices.

00:26:46.340 --> 00:26:47.580
Before I met his mother,

00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:48.860
I had a girlfriend.

00:26:49.580 --> 00:26:50.940
We were together for five years,

00:26:52.020 --> 00:26:52.940
and our feelings ran very deep.

00:26:53.780 --> 00:26:55.100
We were about to get married.

00:26:55.460 --> 00:26:56.180
Suddenly,

00:26:57.420 --> 00:26:58.580
two choices

00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:01.100
were placed before me.

00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:03.900
One was

00:27:04.780 --> 00:27:05.940
to marry my girlfriend

00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:08.620
and struggle

00:27:10.060 --> 00:27:10.980
through a life of poverty.

00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:13.020
The other was to marry

00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:15.060
into the Gao family.

00:27:16.620 --> 00:27:17.460
At that time,

00:27:17.460 --> 00:27:19.340
his mother was the only daughter

00:27:19.340 --> 00:27:21.100
of the wealthiest family in the county.

00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:22.380
She was young

00:27:22.580 --> 00:27:23.580
and quite attractive.

00:27:23.980 --> 00:27:24.980
Many people liked her,

00:27:25.540 --> 00:27:27.500
but she took a fancy to me.

00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:29.980
Everyone around said

00:27:30.340 --> 00:27:32.260
I had hit the jackpot.

00:27:35.620 --> 00:27:37.540
But I couldn't bear
to leave my girlfriend.

00:27:38.020 --> 00:27:39.540
Before I was 25,

00:27:40.420 --> 00:27:41.980
I had never tasted coffee,

00:27:42.420 --> 00:27:43.500
eaten seafood,

00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:44.700
or flown on a plane.

00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:46.900
I hadn't even left my province.

00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:49.020
Got through college

00:27:49.020 --> 00:27:50.340
with scholarships and part-time jobs.

00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:53.100
After graduation,

00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:54.980
my monthly salary barely covered
family expenses,

00:27:56.060 --> 00:27:56.940
leaving almost nothing.

00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:00.700
Conversations with my family

00:28:00.700 --> 00:28:03.060
were mainly around money.

00:28:05.740 --> 00:28:07.100
I believe you can't imagine

00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:08.940
such financial hardship.

00:28:10.380 --> 00:28:11.700
During that time,

00:28:12.580 --> 00:28:14.060
my girlfriend's love for me

00:28:14.060 --> 00:28:16.780
was the only beautiful thing I had

00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:18.660
to be grateful for

00:28:19.860 --> 00:28:21.580
in my poor life.

00:28:21.940 --> 00:28:23.220
I refused the proposal

00:28:24.140 --> 00:28:26.060
from the President,
who was Feng Rui's grandpa.

00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:29.980
He acted very generously.

00:28:30.300 --> 00:28:31.300
He told me

00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:33.620
as long as I continued to work hard,

00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:36.180
I would be promoted fairly.

00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:38.580
By the end of that year,

00:28:39.020 --> 00:28:40.540
I did get a promotion

00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:42.900
and a raise,

00:28:43.860 --> 00:28:45.540
but I was still insignificant

00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:47.580
in the company.

00:28:48.020 --> 00:28:49.220
My salary barely managed

00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:51.380
to support my family.

00:28:54.420 --> 00:28:55.500
You can probably guess

00:28:57.380 --> 00:28:58.660
what happened next.

00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:01.580
So, you left your girlfriend,

00:29:03.100 --> 00:29:05.180
the one beautiful thing in your life.

00:29:06.540 --> 00:29:07.940
Actually, my girlfriend

00:29:09.460 --> 00:29:10.460
chose to let go.

00:29:11.820 --> 00:29:12.740
She told me

00:29:13.260 --> 00:29:14.620
she could accept living a life

00:29:14.620 --> 00:29:16.020
of poverty with me,

00:29:17.820 --> 00:29:19.100
but she couldn't bear

00:29:20.340 --> 00:29:21.140
that I would give up

00:29:21.740 --> 00:29:23.020
an opportunity

00:29:23.020 --> 00:29:24.060
to change my destiny for her.

00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:25.940
She didn't want to face

00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:28.100
my regret and resentment

00:29:29.700 --> 00:29:30.460
in the future.

00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:38.020
I'll be forever grateful

00:29:39.020 --> 00:29:39.820
for her decision.

00:29:42.380 --> 00:29:44.020
Love isn't meant

00:29:45.300 --> 00:29:46.700
to endure erosion.

00:29:47.580 --> 00:29:50.020
Especially once many external factors

00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:51.300
get involved,

00:29:52.020 --> 00:29:54.740
it becomes nearly impossible to

00:29:56.220 --> 00:29:57.140
stay the same.

00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:00.620
Someone has to let go first.

00:30:01.860 --> 00:30:03.300
Considering both of your futures,

00:30:04.820 --> 00:30:05.300
I hope

00:30:06.820 --> 00:30:09.220
you'll let go first.

00:30:48.140 --> 00:30:48.940
Ms. Tan, hello.

00:30:48.940 --> 00:30:49.980
I'm Zhai from the directing team.

00:30:50.420 --> 00:30:50.780
Hello, Zhai.

00:30:50.780 --> 00:30:51.340
This way, please.

00:30:51.340 --> 00:30:51.660
Okay.

00:30:53.860 --> 00:30:55.900
We'll go to the dressing room
for makeup.

00:30:55.900 --> 00:30:56.220
Alright.

00:30:56.220 --> 00:30:57.420
There are two outfits.

00:30:57.420 --> 00:30:58.100
You can try them on.

00:30:58.700 --> 00:31:00.020
I'll wear this one.

00:31:00.340 --> 00:31:00.580
That's fine.

00:31:01.540 --> 00:31:02.140
Hui,

00:31:03.220 --> 00:31:04.100
about this matter,

00:31:05.020 --> 00:31:06.900
Feng Ming has never let me tell you

00:31:08.020 --> 00:31:09.900
to avoid affecting your emotions.

00:31:11.900 --> 00:31:12.740
Over these years,

00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:15.860
he's been doing things silently for us.

00:31:16.980 --> 00:31:18.300
He knows what you want

00:31:18.580 --> 00:31:19.900
and what you don't want,

00:31:20.580 --> 00:31:21.860
always putting your needs first.

00:31:23.900 --> 00:31:25.620
Yet, you turn a blind eye.

00:31:27.900 --> 00:31:29.220
It's not easy for Rui either.

00:31:29.460 --> 00:31:30.300
After going

00:31:31.060 --> 00:31:32.060
through so much,

00:31:32.060 --> 00:31:33.220
they ended up being together again.

00:31:33.820 --> 00:31:36.620
That shows he truly loves this girl.

00:31:39.020 --> 00:31:40.620
I've been thinking these past two days,

00:31:42.180 --> 00:31:43.420
Haotian's matter

00:31:44.180 --> 00:31:46.460
has had a big impact on Rui and Le.

00:31:47.820 --> 00:31:49.740
Was it because we made

00:31:49.820 --> 00:31:50.820
a selfish decision?

00:31:51.380 --> 00:31:51.860
Dad,

00:31:55.020 --> 00:31:57.020
I can't stand her.

00:31:59.420 --> 00:32:00.580
Whenever I see her

00:32:01.700 --> 00:32:02.860
with Rui,

00:32:04.420 --> 00:32:06.740
I can't help but think of Haotian.

00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:10.580
I can't take it.

00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:13.740
Only I know

00:32:15.620 --> 00:32:17.220
how I feel about Haotian.

00:32:19.180 --> 00:32:20.300
No matter what he did,

00:32:22.300 --> 00:32:23.940
he was still my brother.

00:32:26.540 --> 00:32:27.100
Back then,

00:32:28.180 --> 00:32:29.220
my mom went through hell

00:32:29.820 --> 00:32:30.860
to give birth to him,

00:32:32.060 --> 00:32:34.020
and later handed him over to me.

00:32:34.820 --> 00:32:37.940
But I failed to take good care of him.

00:32:40.860 --> 00:32:41.740
So,

00:32:42.580 --> 00:32:43.940
no matter what others said,

00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:45.460
no matter what others did,

00:32:46.580 --> 00:32:48.660
I'd still believe in him.

00:32:52.740 --> 00:32:53.380
Hui,

00:32:54.300 --> 00:32:55.220
you're not young anymore.

00:32:55.740 --> 00:32:57.020
Whatever decision you make,

00:32:58.020 --> 00:32:59.020
I won't interfere.

00:32:59.460 --> 00:33:00.660
I only hope that you can

00:33:01.260 --> 00:33:02.780
be healthier and happier.

00:33:04.260 --> 00:33:05.500
At the end of the day,

00:33:06.500 --> 00:33:09.260
whether it's love or hatred
in this world,

00:33:10.820 --> 00:33:12.020
one must learn to detach

00:33:14.140 --> 00:33:15.260
and slowly let go.

00:33:18.980 --> 00:33:19.860
In this world,

00:33:20.980 --> 00:33:21.980
things forgettable

00:33:22.540 --> 00:33:23.580
have long been forgotten.

00:33:25.180 --> 00:33:26.140
But those unforgettable

00:33:26.980 --> 00:33:28.220
will never fade away.

00:33:39.980 --> 00:33:42.460
Take Le back in a couple of days.

00:33:51.140 --> 00:33:51.900
I always thought

00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:53.700
that in this family,

00:33:54.860 --> 00:33:56.180
you understood me best.

00:34:01.620 --> 00:34:02.580
Sorry, Rui.

00:34:05.900 --> 00:34:06.700
You know,

00:34:07.900 --> 00:34:09.620
things were complicated back then.

00:34:11.860 --> 00:34:12.940
Haotian's incident

00:34:13.940 --> 00:34:15.860
caused huge turmoil for the Gao family.

00:34:16.900 --> 00:34:19.140
To protect the Gao family's legacy,

00:34:19.460 --> 00:34:20.620
your mom tried every means

00:34:21.180 --> 00:34:22.180
and lobbied everywhere.

00:34:23.740 --> 00:34:25.420
She couldn't sleep at night.

00:34:25.620 --> 00:34:27.140
It was really hard for her

00:34:27.140 --> 00:34:28.980
to face what Haotian did.

00:34:29.900 --> 00:34:31.140
But in front of others,

00:34:32.500 --> 00:34:33.860
she had to appear very strong.

00:34:35.140 --> 00:34:36.380
This was her fate.

00:34:38.620 --> 00:34:39.740
Moreover,

00:34:40.900 --> 00:34:42.420
back then, Tan Siting's

00:34:43.500 --> 00:34:45.700
mental state was not optimistic.

00:34:46.420 --> 00:34:47.260
Your mom thought

00:34:47.380 --> 00:34:48.740
we couldn't entrust her

00:34:49.460 --> 00:34:51.620
with a baby that still needed
an incubator.

00:34:52.620 --> 00:34:54.740
You were so young back then
and didn't know

00:34:55.900 --> 00:34:57.740
how long or difficult the road ahead

00:34:58.940 --> 00:34:59.500
would be.

00:35:01.140 --> 00:35:01.740
So,

00:35:02.140 --> 00:35:02.780
separating

00:35:04.300 --> 00:35:05.740
might have been the best choice.

00:35:08.580 --> 00:35:10.900
I thought Ting had told you everything,

00:35:10.940 --> 00:35:12.100
but I never expected her to...

00:35:15.700 --> 00:35:16.700
Rui, I know

00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:18.820
you've suffered these years.

00:35:20.860 --> 00:35:21.500
Actually,

00:35:22.460 --> 00:35:23.300
I've blamed myself

00:35:24.540 --> 00:35:25.940
for as long as you've suffered.

00:35:29.580 --> 00:35:31.380
So now I've come to terms with it.

00:35:35.620 --> 00:35:36.580
As long as you're happy

00:35:37.100 --> 00:35:38.100
and Le is happy,

00:35:38.860 --> 00:35:40.700
you can marry Ting and go to France.

00:35:41.180 --> 00:35:42.460
I'll support you

00:35:43.580 --> 00:35:44.580
no matter what you choose.

00:35:46.540 --> 00:35:47.820
It's a way for me to make up

00:35:49.620 --> 00:35:51.100
for my mistake 12 years ago.

00:35:53.380 --> 00:35:53.940
I

00:35:57.380 --> 00:35:58.060
wish you well.

00:35:59.540 --> 00:36:00.380
May you be happy.

00:36:28.740 --> 00:36:29.460
It's getting late.

00:36:30.220 --> 00:36:31.020
Go back and rest.

00:36:36.620 --> 00:36:37.540
Thank you.

00:36:39.860 --> 00:36:40.780
For what?

00:36:41.380 --> 00:36:42.060
It's all in the past.

00:36:45.100 --> 00:36:47.180
Then about Rui…

00:36:48.620 --> 00:36:49.740
You don't need

00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:51.060
to interfere.

00:36:51.740 --> 00:36:52.540
But you want to meddle?

00:36:53.180 --> 00:36:55.460
Still going to make Rui suffer
in the middle?

00:36:56.380 --> 00:36:58.180
And keep Le living without a mother?

00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:05.860
Just stay out of it!

00:37:13.180 --> 00:37:13.940
Okay, no problem.

00:37:13.980 --> 00:37:14.860
Fill it out and take a look.

00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:16.620
Check the questions.

00:37:16.900 --> 00:37:17.180
Okay.

00:37:18.100 --> 00:37:18.980
All of these?

00:37:19.020 --> 00:37:19.980
Yes, including receiving.

00:37:20.380 --> 00:37:21.740
Bai, the camera position is ready.

00:37:21.740 --> 00:37:22.740
What kind of shots do you need?

00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:23.500
Just a moment, please.

00:37:23.620 --> 00:37:24.620
Ms. Tan, excuse me.

00:37:24.620 --> 00:37:25.100
Alright.

00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:33.700
Hello.

00:37:34.620 --> 00:37:35.140
Siting,

00:37:36.620 --> 00:37:37.180
are you

00:37:39.100 --> 00:37:39.900
doing okay over there?

00:37:41.540 --> 00:37:42.180
Everything's going smoothly.

00:37:44.180 --> 00:37:45.740
Le is fine, don't worry.

00:37:48.220 --> 00:37:49.540
When will the shooting finish?

00:37:50.900 --> 00:37:52.660
In about two or three hours.

00:37:54.740 --> 00:37:55.100
Okay.

00:37:55.980 --> 00:37:56.540
Do your best.

00:37:57.980 --> 00:37:58.380
Alright.

00:37:59.380 --> 00:37:59.660
Bye.

00:38:08.300 --> 00:38:09.620
Hello, dear audience.

00:38:09.620 --> 00:38:11.420
Welcome to City of Dance.

00:38:11.460 --> 00:38:12.900
I'm Yu, your host for today.

00:38:13.420 --> 00:38:14.980
Today, we're honored

00:38:15.020 --> 00:38:16.060
to have

00:38:16.100 --> 00:38:17.740
a truly remarkable guest

00:38:17.980 --> 00:38:20.420
joining us on set,

00:38:20.620 --> 00:38:21.180
Tan Siting,

00:38:21.300 --> 00:38:22.180
the world-renowned ballerina.

00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:23.100
Let's welcome Ms. Tan.

00:38:24.100 --> 00:38:25.420
Ms. Tan, please say hello
to our viewers.

00:38:25.900 --> 00:38:26.620
Hello everyone,

00:38:26.620 --> 00:38:27.540
I'm Tan Siting.

00:38:27.740 --> 00:38:30.220
Today, we collected a question.

00:38:30.460 --> 00:38:32.300
A viewer would very much like to ask.

00:38:32.540 --> 00:38:35.180
He said you started learning ballet
out of interest from a young age,

00:38:35.300 --> 00:38:36.860
and now it has become your career.

00:38:37.100 --> 00:38:39.500
This is a lifestyle
many people dream of.

00:38:39.740 --> 00:38:40.420
Regarding this,

00:38:40.460 --> 00:38:42.100
what's your advice?

00:38:43.380 --> 00:38:44.500
Many people might think

00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:46.540
when doing something
you're interested in,

00:38:47.420 --> 00:38:48.460
it's easier to immerse yourself,

00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:50.060
stay passionate,

00:38:50.100 --> 00:38:50.900
and succeed.

00:38:51.260 --> 00:38:53.140
But I hold a different view.

00:38:54.100 --> 00:38:55.220
When pursuing any endeavor,

00:38:55.220 --> 00:38:57.860
you'll face setbacks and difficulties.

00:38:58.220 --> 00:38:59.380
How you respond

00:38:59.700 --> 00:39:00.500
is what truly matters.

00:39:01.580 --> 00:39:02.620
Because we

00:39:02.860 --> 00:39:04.500
waver and struggle.

00:39:05.300 --> 00:39:06.860
Faced with adversity,

00:39:07.420 --> 00:39:09.300
you may retreat

00:39:09.900 --> 00:39:11.180
or even give up.

00:39:11.620 --> 00:39:13.100
But I believe this is normal.

00:39:13.980 --> 00:39:16.700
When facing setbacks and difficulties,

00:39:16.900 --> 00:39:18.500
how do you adjust

00:39:18.580 --> 00:39:19.860
your mindset?

00:39:21.900 --> 00:39:23.100
I believe success is never easy,

00:39:24.580 --> 00:39:25.660
and failure is common.

00:39:27.180 --> 00:39:28.500
At such times, better to try

00:39:28.540 --> 00:39:29.860
to relax, let go,

00:39:30.700 --> 00:39:31.860
and then start fresh.

00:39:32.620 --> 00:39:33.740
Work hard to overcome the challenge.

00:39:34.980 --> 00:39:36.220
When you do, you'll find

00:39:36.220 --> 00:39:38.220
you gain a deep sense of accomplishment,

00:39:38.860 --> 00:39:40.580
which will fuel you with greater drive

00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:42.700
to continue pursuing your dreams.

00:39:43.580 --> 00:39:44.060
[City of Dance]
Thank you

00:39:44.060 --> 00:39:45.900
[Dance with Passion]
for sharing with us

00:39:45.900 --> 00:39:46.860
truly valuable experience.

00:39:47.340 --> 00:39:48.220
I heard

00:39:48.460 --> 00:39:50.540
that after your last performance,

00:39:50.740 --> 00:39:52.140
you decided to retire.

00:39:52.420 --> 00:39:54.020
So I'd like to ask,

00:39:54.020 --> 00:39:55.460
any special reason behind this decision?

00:40:02.100 --> 00:40:03.020
Because I wanted to come back home.

00:40:03.740 --> 00:40:04.500
I wanted

00:40:06.140 --> 00:40:07.020
to come back here,

00:40:08.500 --> 00:40:11.020
especially to see my teacher,
whom I haven't seen for long,

00:40:12.020 --> 00:40:14.140
and to visit my hometown,
where I grew up and learned to dance.

00:40:14.900 --> 00:40:16.860
I also learned
that after returning to China,

00:40:16.980 --> 00:40:18.740
you became a guest instructor

00:40:18.740 --> 00:40:20.220
at a dance school.

00:40:20.380 --> 00:40:20.700
Yes.

00:40:21.020 --> 00:40:21.700
Why is that?

00:40:23.140 --> 00:40:25.700
Because Ms. Zhuang,
the founder of this school,

00:40:26.860 --> 00:40:29.220
was my first ballet teacher.

00:40:35.660 --> 00:40:36.260
Hui.

00:40:40.380 --> 00:40:40.980
Hui.

00:40:43.340 --> 00:40:44.540
You need to eat something.

00:40:45.140 --> 00:40:46.380
You haven't eaten in two whole days.

00:40:47.340 --> 00:40:49.500
Carrying on like this, you'll collapse.

00:40:52.260 --> 00:40:52.700
Ms. Yang,

00:40:53.540 --> 00:40:54.020
let me handle it.

00:40:55.500 --> 00:40:55.860
Okay.

00:41:06.060 --> 00:41:06.380
Mom,

00:41:10.020 --> 00:41:10.820
eat something,

00:41:12.060 --> 00:41:13.180
or you'll wear yourself out.

00:41:52.940 --> 00:41:53.420
Hao...

00:41:57.700 --> 00:41:58.460
Haotian.

00:42:13.780 --> 00:42:14.740
Haotian.

00:42:20.820 --> 00:42:22.540
I feel like he hasn't left.

00:42:23.860 --> 00:42:25.300
He's still here.

00:42:31.180 --> 00:42:33.260
He wouldn't do that.

00:42:38.340 --> 00:42:38.740
Mom.

00:42:40.380 --> 00:42:40.820
Mom,

00:42:43.220 --> 00:42:44.220
this is the police's conclusion.

00:42:46.420 --> 00:42:46.940
Maybe he had

00:42:49.300 --> 00:42:50.420
too much to drink that day.

00:43:06.460 --> 00:43:07.140
That

00:43:08.140 --> 00:43:08.780
Tan something.

00:43:10.740 --> 00:43:11.660
And that girl.

00:43:13.100 --> 00:43:14.180
Do you know them?

00:43:17.820 --> 00:43:19.260
He's Shi Wei's master.

00:43:20.380 --> 00:43:21.180
We've met

00:43:21.460 --> 00:43:22.740
in the break room a few times.

00:43:24.980 --> 00:43:26.380
He seems pretty humble.
