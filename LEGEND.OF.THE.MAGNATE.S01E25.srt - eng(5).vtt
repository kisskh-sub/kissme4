[Legend of the Magnate]

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:38.000
[Episode 25]

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.060
Please have a seat.

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:43.789
Let me.

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:50.789
Have a taste, Lord Gu.

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.229
This is what they usually drink.

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.560
It's similar to our tea.

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.120
How do you like it?

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.190
Similar?

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:11.570
Not at all.

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:14.590
The British don't drink tea?

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:15.320
They do.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.730
They just add milk to it.

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:20.329
Captain.

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.290
Greetings, sir.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.930
It's a pleasure to meet you.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:30.910
A handshake will do.

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.840
He said it's a pleasure to meet you.

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.970
How are you?

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.690
How are you?

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:36.150
I'm fine.

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:37.620
He's great.

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.400
[Tod, British Warship Captain]

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.310
The captain says

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:43.560
this warship belongs to

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.340
the British Empire's Indian Navy,

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.400
protecting the Indian Ocean routes.

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:50.400
He's

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.870
going back to India to report for duty.

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.480
This ship is not for sale.

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.560
Okay.

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:55.680
I was just about to ask

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:56.410
about India.

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:09.630
Thank you.

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:10.430
See you.

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:11.680
No problem.

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.200
Mr. Zhang from Lu'an Salt Shop.

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:19.120
I'm here.

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.840
Excuse me.

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:23.680
Our Master wants to see you.

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:33.240
Mr. Li.

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:34.750
You're here, bro.

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:35.800
Have a seat.

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:42.400
Mr. Li,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.540
I won't lie to your face.

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:45.840
I'll be frank.

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:48.660
This salt field

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.800
has been in my family for 3 generations.

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:51.660
I heard

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.710
you were buying salt fields in bulk,

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:55.370
so I rushed over with the deed.

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:57.430
It's just that...

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:58.800
if I just sell it

00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:59.910
like this,

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:03.250
I'd be betraying my ancestors.

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:07.190
Taking someone's ancestral property

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:08.430
is unforgivable.

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.240
This salt field deed
is not that important to me—

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:13.190
I can take it or leave it.

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:15.750
But if I don't buy it,

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:16.680
brother,

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:18.480
can you go back?

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.510
If I'm not mistaken,

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:21.600
that outfit

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:23.120
is what you just redeemed

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.180
from the pawnshop.

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:27.190
There are

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.390
more than 390 salt households in Jiangnan.

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:31.480
Since I'm getting into the salt business,

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:32.800
I must be careful.

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:35.940
Please forgive me if I offended you.

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:38.090
To be honest,

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:42.510
life is indeed a bit hard right now.

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:46.580
How about this?

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:48.680
I'll give you some money

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:49.680
to open a salt shop

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.120
so you can make a living.

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.360
In name, the shop

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:53.159
will be yours.

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:54.310
Once it turns a profit,

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:56.040
we'll split it eighty–twenty.

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.060
I'll supply the goods.

00:04:58.159 --> 00:04:59.040
Take

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:00.070
this deed back.

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.680
Mr. Li,

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:12.040
you're truly a living Bodhisattva.

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:13.480
You're helping me at a time like this

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:15.340
so that our whole family can live.

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:15.740
I...

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:18.410
I don't know what to say.

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:19.240
You...

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:23.640
Take him down

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:26.180
and hand over the money
and the salt license.

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:27.840
Let's go.

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:47.120
Father.

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.860
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:56.000
Just a few hours feels long to you?

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:57.650
It's not that I can't wait.

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:00.330
I've been waiting for more than 20 years.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.160
Are you upset?

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:05.040
Then tell me, what have you been waiting

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:06.170
for all these years?

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:10.160
I'm waiting for a chance.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.720
Waiting for your trust.

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:14.280
I've barely been here a few days,

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:15.750
my seat isn't even warm,

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:16.870
and here you are.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.420
When will that old fox Hu

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:19.720
surrender?

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:20.270
Soon.

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:22.030
I followed your arrangement

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:23.390
and gave him 3 days.

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:25.040
Three days?

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:27.110
How do you know it'll be soon?

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:28.360
He's at a dead end.

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:30.070
But I heard him tell the tea merchants

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:31.040
that if they can't hold out,

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:32.470
they can sell the tea to him

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:34.130
and he'll buy it back

00:06:34.159 --> 00:06:36.020
according to the previous price.

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:38.590
He was just dreaming.

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:40.720
He's afraid we'll split his power.

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:42.680
He's still reluctant to admit his failure.

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:43.690
This old man

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:45.430
has been in charge of tea in a province

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:46.480
for most of his life.

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:47.240
And you think he's scared?

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:48.600
You naive young man.

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:51.870
He's hoarding tea

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:54.600
to challenge us.

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:56.280
Challenge us with what?

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:58.430
At worst, we don't buy his goods

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:00.160
and let him cry

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:01.190
over that old tea.

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:03.010
Don't pile it here.

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:04.070
How can we get in?

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:09.490
[Tea]

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:14.160
Has Mr. Gu

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:15.180
brought any news?

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:16.140
No.

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:17.600
Is there no room in the warehouse?

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:17.950
Go.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:18.600
Mr. Hou Er,

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:19.940
the warehouse is full.

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:20.890
Full?

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:21.430
Yes.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:23.750
Old Master Hu.

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:25.350
Old Master Hu, Old Master Hu.

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:29.120
Waiting like this

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:30.290
isn't going to work.

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:31.430
The nearby tea merchants

00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:32.750
all know you have a way,

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:34.070
so they keep

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:35.360
sending tea here.

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:37.040
The money in our counter

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:38.170
flows out like water

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:39.390
and never comes back.

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:41.360
The tea gets older every day.

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:43.640
Spring tea has a daily price.

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:44.920
What do we do if we don't wait?

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:45.390
Well...

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:46.800
Right now, the whole market

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:47.560
follows the same price—

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:48.630
that's set by Li Wantang.

00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:50.240
You tell me, do I accept it or not?

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:51.040
Well, why does Li Million

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:52.070
hold a grudge against us?

00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:53.800
Don't you know that?

00:07:54.159 --> 00:07:55.680
Isn't it because

00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:56.720
that Mr. Gu

00:07:56.750 --> 00:07:57.720
ruined his plan?

00:07:58.270 --> 00:07:59.270
If you ask me,

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:01.360
you should just compromise a little

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:03.160
and beg Li Wantang for some leniency.

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:04.390
The lives
of all the tea merchants in Anhui

00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:06.120
are in your hands.

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:08.000
Wait, you...

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.130
Old Master Hu, you have an invitation.

00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:11.560
Invitation?

00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:12.160
I'm busy.

00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:13.510
It's a guest from the capital.

00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:14.360
From the capital?

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:14.950
Come on.

00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:18.270
[Yours Humbly, Li Wantang.]

00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:19.070
Old Master Hu.

00:08:19.950 --> 00:08:21.950
Li Wantang invited you personally.

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:23.350
This is a way out.

00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:24.680
At least it gives you face.

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:25.920
It would be inappropriate

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:27.190
if you don't go.

00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:29.040
If I go,

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:30.040
it's for the Tea Merchants' Association.

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:30.720
Of course.

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:35.440
You never said anything

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:36.630
about buying a ship.

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:38.760
See you again, my friend.

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:41.200
When did I ever say

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:42.240
I wanted to buy a ship?

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:43.390
Are you even here to handle

00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:44.440
the tea business or not?

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:45.480
Isn't that exactly

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:46.540
what I'm doing now?

00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:48.080
Come on, Pingyuan,
focus on the proper work,

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:48.870
will you?

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:51.240
You came here
and just drank some black bitter water.

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:52.300
You didn't like it?

00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:54.080
I found it interesting.

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:56.200
I like it.

00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:57.600
I like it.

00:08:58.550 --> 00:08:59.600
Go back now.

00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:01.150
Why?

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:02.870
You didn't get it done,

00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:03.510
Pingyuan.

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:05.250
That British guy said

00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:06.200
the imperial court

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:07.360
has given the authority to purchase tea

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:08.270
to the Li family.

00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:09.360
If they don't buy it from us,

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:10.120
many people in Anhui

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:11.960
will hang themselves
or jump into rivers this year.

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:13.690
How is that considered "done?"

00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:16.550
Your logic is getting

00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:17.750
clearer and clearer.

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:18.300
Not bad.

00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:18.790
Pingyuan,

00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:20.270
stop teasing me.

00:09:20.270 --> 00:09:20.910
Just tell me—

00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:22.790
do we have a solution or not?

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:26.080
Here's what we do.

00:09:26.510 --> 00:09:28.170
Rent a fast boat immediately.

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:29.360
You must go back

00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:30.650
before dawn tomorrow.

00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:33.280
Impossible.

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:35.080
Even if I could do magic,
I couldn't make it.

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:35.790
Didn't you hear

00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:36.960
that foreigner just now?

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:37.600
Li Million has to deliver

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:38.860
within 3 days.

00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:40.750
He's not in Beijing right now.

00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:41.830
My only worry is

00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:42.630
Old Master Hu

00:09:42.670 --> 00:09:43.440
getting soft

00:09:43.510 --> 00:09:44.530
and selling the tea.

00:09:44.530 --> 00:09:45.790
If that happens,

00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:46.910
there will be no place for us

00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:48.030
in Anhui.

00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:48.960
When you get back,

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:50.090
tell Old Master Hu

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:51.360
to give me one more day and night.

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:52.000
I will definitely

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.200
get this done for him.

00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:55.200
One day...

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:56.150
and one night?

00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:57.750
Tell him exactly what I said.

00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:01.480
Well... so where are you going?

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:02.970
I have my things to do.

00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:05.390
Those foreigners can scheme against us,

00:10:05.390 --> 00:10:07.150
and we can scheme against them too.

00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:08.750
Before, our disadvantage

00:10:08.770 --> 00:10:09.960
was that we knew too little

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:10.620
about them.

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:12.240
Just wait and see.

00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:14.200
Once this is over,

00:10:14.270 --> 00:10:16.470
we'll have plenty of big business to do.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:18.600
Pingyuan,

00:10:19.270 --> 00:10:21.090
can you just give me a hint?

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:22.030
No.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.200
It's not the time yet.

00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:26.760
Don't worry.

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:29.290
You'll understand when it's done.

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:30.480
So what if Li Million

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:31.240
is strong?

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:32.080
Since he wants to

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:33.410
drive me into a dead end,

00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:35.750
he can't blame me.

00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:37.790
I told you to keep an eye

00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:39.120
on that Gu.

00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:41.050
Where is he now?

00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:44.840
I-I don't know.

00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:45.870
I'm not sure.

00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:51.120
Master,

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:52.940
he left it to us.

00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:53.790
So soon?

00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:55.720
He agreed to leave the deed here

00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:56.360
[Official Certificate]

00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:57.220
as collateral.

00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:58.030
This family

00:10:58.120 --> 00:10:59.150
smokes opium every day.

00:10:59.150 --> 00:11:01.080
I don't think the deed
will last more than 3 days.

00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:02.530
They're suffering
but still want to save face—

00:11:02.530 --> 00:11:02.740
what's the point?

00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:04.240
[Official Certificate]

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:05.120
Do I

00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:06.440
have a dinner with Old Master Hu

00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:07.320
tonight?

00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:10.840
Yes, Master.

00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:13.080
Go tell the people outside

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.050
to head home

00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:16.410
and come back tomorrow.

00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:18.510
Wait!

00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:20.390
Father,

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:21.840
you promised

00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:23.460
to let me handle things here.

00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:24.840
I just came here today, and you're now

00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:26.300
stirring things up again.

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:27.870
If you go to this dinner tonight,

00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:29.200
I'll go back to the capital!

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:31.200
I'll just leave everything behind!

00:11:36.390 --> 00:11:36.920
Leave us.

00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:55.030
Are you angry?

00:12:16.270 --> 00:12:18.840
Was it you who suggested Gu Pingyuan

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:21.020
go to Shanghai?

00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:22.110
Was it?

00:12:25.270 --> 00:12:26.360
He doesn't understand

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:27.240
how the Qing Empire's customs work

00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:28.000
at all. What's going on?

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.550
He's just a small-time tea farmer,

00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:31.500
a prisoner who escaped from exile.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.360
I don't understand,

00:12:33.510 --> 00:12:34.870
why do you have to be friends

00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:36.030
with him?

00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:38.440
You'd rather
ruin your own family's business

00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:39.690
to help an outsider!

00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:47.360
Father,

00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:51.130
you had people eavesdrop on me.

00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:56.840
Whether this tea deal

00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:58.030
makes or loses money—

00:12:58.030 --> 00:12:59.670
I don't care at all.

00:12:59.750 --> 00:13:02.280
There are
plenty of business opportunities.

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:04.240
But I have

00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:06.550
only one son.

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:10.390
Tell me,

00:13:11.550 --> 00:13:12.870
why did you do that?

00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:15.270
Why?

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:19.200
I just thought

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:24.530
we couldn't do business like that.

00:13:25.390 --> 00:13:27.120
Then how should we do business?

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:31.080
It doesn't have to be a fight
to the death.

00:13:32.630 --> 00:13:35.830
The roads of the world
should be open for everyone to walk.

00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:38.090
Why do you have to

00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:40.180
force others into a corner like that?

00:13:55.790 --> 00:13:57.480
I regret it.

00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:00.000
I should've let you

00:14:00.030 --> 00:14:01.390
keep studying.

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:04.480
You're not cut out for business.

00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:11.240
As long as you don't smoke opium
or gamble,

00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:12.960
our family fortune

00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:14.890
will last you several lifetimes.

00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:18.720
Fine.

00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:21.010
Go back to the capital.

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:23.730
I'll hire an old Hanlin scholar

00:14:23.870 --> 00:14:25.930
to help you pick up your studies again

00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:27.840
and teach you

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:30.870
the classics.

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:32.860
That would be good too.

00:14:34.390 --> 00:14:34.910
Father,

00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:38.630
you want me

00:14:38.630 --> 00:14:40.760
to withdraw from the family business?

00:14:41.510 --> 00:14:42.080
Yes.

00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:46.450
You're not made for business.

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:49.770
And you don't understand the Qing Empire.

00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:50.840
I don't!

00:14:52.270 --> 00:14:53.080
You do!

00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:54.790
You are always right!

00:14:56.910 --> 00:14:58.720
I'm the one who suggested Gu Pingyuan

00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:00.120
go to Shanghai.

00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:01.360
I didn't even

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:03.560
want to come to Anhui in the first place.

00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:06.600
You want to buy the goods
from those tea merchants

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:08.170
at 20 percent of its value—

00:15:08.910 --> 00:15:10.550
that's bullying!

00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:11.790
That's pushing them

00:15:11.790 --> 00:15:13.480
to the brink!

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:17.020
What kind of business is this?

00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:20.250
If you had troops,

00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:23.000
you might as well send soldiers
to rob them!

00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:24.720
Wouldn't that be easier?

00:15:24.870 --> 00:15:26.120
Kid, kid,

00:15:27.750 --> 00:15:31.810
a kind man can't command troops,
and a righteous man can't manage wealth.

00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:34.790
Whose path is really easy?

00:15:39.870 --> 00:15:40.800
So you're saying

00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:43.750
I can't do business

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:46.720
because I can't be a bad guy?

00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:07.200
We're exploiting Anhui this time

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:09.130
because His Highness wanted us to.

00:16:09.750 --> 00:16:11.320
He was furious that the Anhui people

00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:13.440
ruined his plan
at the Grand Tea Competition.

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:15.660
You think I can afford to show mercy,

00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:16.510
let them go,

00:16:16.510 --> 00:16:17.910
and offend His Highness?

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:21.440
I can't.

00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:26.300
If His Highness fails,
I'll be dragged down.

00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:27.800
I can only be Li Million

00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:29.720
if he doesn't fail.

00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:38.050

I'm late.

00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:14.200
I'm terribly sorry.

00:17:14.829 --> 00:17:15.680
Our master

00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:17.349
told me to give you a message.

00:17:17.349 --> 00:17:17.880
He

00:17:18.109 --> 00:17:19.369
won't be coming today.

00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:24.790
He's Li Million, after all.

00:17:24.790 --> 00:17:26.190
Of course he's very busy.

00:17:26.589 --> 00:17:29.350
Please ask Mr. Li

00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:31.000
when he'll be free.

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:32.310
I'll visit him then.

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:34.080
I brought some gifts.

I don't know...

00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:37.090
Our master wouldn't dare accept them.

00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:39.000
One shouldn't take rewards
without earning them.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.160
Our young master

00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:41.510
didn't handle the tea matter well.

00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:42.720
The foreigners pressed the price

too low.

Yes.

00:17:45.030 --> 00:17:46.430
Our master said the quota

00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:48.880
for this year's spring tea
is already enough.

00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:50.480
There's no need to offend our peers.

00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:51.440
That's right.

00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:53.120
Keep it for yourself.

00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:54.570

Sir,

00:18:05.110 --> 00:18:06.710

[Baixiang Restaurant]

00:18:09.310 --> 00:18:12.110

He can't force us to death, can he?

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:18.590
How about this?

00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:19.920
Please

00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:21.160
help us ask Mr. Li.

00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:22.770
As long as he gives us

00:18:23.070 --> 00:18:24.830
at least a little for our hard work,

00:18:24.830 --> 00:18:25.960
we'll treat the rest

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:28.830
as doing it for free.

00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:31.310

Of course.

00:18:36.590 --> 00:18:37.240
It's settled then.

00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:37.720
Okay.

Tomorrow morning,

than keep them.

Master,

00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:05.830
your not showing up scared him badly.

00:19:05.830 --> 00:19:07.030
He kept begging for leniency.

00:19:07.030 --> 00:19:07.790
In the end, he said

00:19:07.790 --> 00:19:09.650
Young Master's price was too low,

00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:10.750

He said they just didn't want
their hard work to go to waste.

00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:14.270

in his head?

He thinks I don't know how to do business.

to secure the exclusive rights

from His Highness.

00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:02.110
The Grand Tea Competition
was just an event

to give His Highness face.

00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:05.070
"Top Tea Under Heaven" was supposed

00:21:05.070 --> 00:21:06.160
to be granted to the Li family,

00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:06.920
and then it would be natural

00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:08.200
for the Master to gain the right

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:09.240
to trade with foreigners.

00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:10.110

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:11.490
would ruin everything?

So you were sent ahead to shake them up.

never planned to attend.

his hopes high,

then threw him straight into despair.

Has Master

00:24:13.550 --> 00:24:15.270
ever miscalculated in business?

Indeed.

How long are we supposed to wait?

00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:32.960
I told you from the start—

00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:34.640
Orchid Snow tea is a monster

00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:36.030
and shouldn't have been brought
to the capital.

00:24:36.030 --> 00:24:36.590
And what happened?

00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:39.770
and stirred everything up.

What kind of nonsense is that?

00:24:47.110 --> 00:24:48.720
Sun Wukong was very capable,

00:24:48.750 --> 00:24:50.030
but when he ruined the Peach Banquet,

00:24:56.310 --> 00:24:57.270
That's right.

00:24:57.350 --> 00:24:58.670
What kind of situation is this?

00:24:58.670 --> 00:25:01.680
Then why don't you come up with an idea?

00:25:02.310 --> 00:25:04.670
What good is all this useless talk?

00:25:04.790 --> 00:25:05.310
When he won the title

00:25:05.310 --> 00:25:06.590
of "Top Tea Under Heaven,"

00:25:06.590 --> 00:25:07.550
you all rushed

00:25:07.550 --> 00:25:09.400
to ask for his recipe and tea seeds.

00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:11.840
Why are you all just talking now?

00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:16.110
Mr. Hu,

00:25:16.550 --> 00:25:18.220
spring tea waits for no one.

00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:19.680
Let's not talk about

00:25:19.790 --> 00:25:20.880
what Gu is like for now.

00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:22.430
We need to get through

00:25:22.550 --> 00:25:23.610
this crisis first.

00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:24.900
Otherwise,

00:25:25.030 --> 00:25:27.030
everyone will be doomed.

00:25:27.110 --> 00:25:27.830
That's right.

00:25:27.830 --> 00:25:28.750
Everyone will be doomed.

00:25:28.750 --> 00:25:29.680
All of us.

00:25:31.030 --> 00:25:32.830
If any of you think

00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:33.750
you're capable

00:25:33.750 --> 00:25:35.240
of getting us through this crisis,

00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:37.370
I'll kneel and step down immediately.

00:25:37.830 --> 00:25:39.960
If you have no ideas, then just shut up.

00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:41.070
What?

00:25:41.270 --> 00:25:43.110
Li Wantang is using official power
to pressure us.

00:25:43.110 --> 00:25:44.580
Even if we hand over

00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:45.480
Mr. Gu's head,

00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:46.900
will he stop?

00:25:47.030 --> 00:25:48.110
Who got us the plaque

00:25:48.110 --> 00:25:49.510
of "Top Tea Under Heaven?"

00:25:49.510 --> 00:25:51.910
Who works their butt off
every day outside?

00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:54.530
I'm honestly embarrassed for you all.

00:25:54.550 --> 00:25:55.400
Shame on you.

00:25:55.550 --> 00:25:56.890
You seriously think

00:25:57.200 --> 00:25:58.700
Master will lose?

00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:01.000
When I first arrived,

00:26:01.030 --> 00:26:01.810
I said

00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:03.480
the tea business in Anhui

00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:04.920
shouldn't be handled this way.

00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:05.960
If we want to run
the "Top Tea Under Heaven" brand,

00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:07.640
we could negotiate with them.

00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:09.680
Why bully them

00:26:09.750 --> 00:26:10.830
so arrogantly?

00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:13.240
Who does business like that?

00:26:15.270 --> 00:26:16.580
At first, I thought

00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:18.270
Master was just venting his anger.

00:26:18.270 --> 00:26:19.640
Now that I think about it,

00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:21.200
what he said makes sense.

00:26:22.310 --> 00:26:23.370
As the saying goes,

00:26:23.590 --> 00:26:25.270
"No merchant is without cunning."

00:26:25.270 --> 00:26:26.680
It's a bit harsh,

00:26:27.030 --> 00:26:28.400
but it's right.

00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:51.580
You're Pingwen?

00:26:51.790 --> 00:26:53.050
Where is your brother?

00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:56.500
Did he leave a message?

00:26:58.720 --> 00:26:59.680
What did he say?

00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:00.820
What did he say?

00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:07.240
Servants!

00:27:07.790 --> 00:27:08.880
Take him inside.

00:27:09.550 --> 00:27:11.150
Make them some hot porridge.

00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:18.200
Old Master Hu,

00:27:18.310 --> 00:27:19.150
let's go.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:21.960
Even if you want to die,
wait a little longer.

00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:23.290
What are we waiting for?

00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:24.270
Look at him—

00:27:24.310 --> 00:27:25.070
what can he even say?

00:27:25.070 --> 00:27:25.930
I remember now.

00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:29.780
My brother said...

00:27:30.550 --> 00:27:31.680
What did he say?

00:27:32.790 --> 00:27:35.450
He said to wait for him
for one more day and night.

00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:36.680
Is there ever an end?

00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:37.540
Get him inside!

00:28:29.830 --> 00:28:31.070
He really dares?

00:28:33.070 --> 00:28:34.310
He really dares.

00:28:37.350 --> 00:28:38.010
Is it funny?

00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:38.880
No.

00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:44.130
Have you sent people to ask around?

00:28:44.550 --> 00:28:45.720
Is he afraid to come,

00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:46.900
or

00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:49.500
is someone among them against it?

00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:51.810
No one's against it.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:53.520
It's just that old guy Hu

00:28:53.550 --> 00:28:54.790
holding out on his own.

00:28:54.790 --> 00:28:56.000
Master, please don't be angry.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:57.590
I don't think he can hold out much longer.

00:28:57.590 --> 00:28:58.350
It's not like

00:28:58.350 --> 00:28:59.810
he can turn things around.

00:29:00.070 --> 00:29:01.350
I can't believe it.

00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:03.290
By logic,

00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:05.310
he should've been cornered.

00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:06.960
So how did he stand his ground

00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:08.160
after just one night?

00:29:09.110 --> 00:29:10.110
Something's off.

00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:12.480
Something's off.

00:29:13.510 --> 00:29:14.580
Nothing's off.

00:29:14.750 --> 00:29:16.110
If he wants to drag it out, let him.

00:29:16.110 --> 00:29:17.570
We can outlast him anyway.

00:29:22.830 --> 00:29:23.880
It must be

00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:25.750
that brat Gu causing trouble.

00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:34.200
Send some men to Shanghai

00:29:34.270 --> 00:29:35.510
to dig around

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:38.260
and see what he's up to.

00:29:38.550 --> 00:29:39.110
Okay.

00:29:43.590 --> 00:29:44.110
Father,

00:29:44.350 --> 00:29:45.680
I'm going back to sleep.

00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:47.720
Our business is not going well.

00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:49.110
How dare you go to sleep?

00:29:51.270 --> 00:29:52.110
It's your business,

00:29:52.110 --> 00:29:53.240
not mine.

00:29:59.510 --> 00:30:00.320
Go back.

00:30:00.350 --> 00:30:01.590
So many people are waiting for you.

00:30:01.590 --> 00:30:02.240
Yes.

00:30:06.830 --> 00:30:07.680
Go back.

00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:10.520
Old Master Hu, there's a letter!

00:30:12.790 --> 00:30:13.590
Old Master Hu.

[so that I may offer my apologies
in person.]

00:30:34.310 --> 00:30:35.240
It's Li Million.

00:30:36.590 --> 00:30:37.300
Li Million?

00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:37.980
He said that

00:30:39.270 --> 00:30:41.130
because he stood me up yesterday,

00:30:41.350 --> 00:30:42.810
he wanted to make it up to me

00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:44.660
by inviting me to a banquet

00:30:45.070 --> 00:30:47.890
at Baixiang Restaurant at noon today.

00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:49.830
Go. You should go.

00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:50.680
Old Master Hu,

00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:53.290
we must accept the face he's giving us.

00:30:54.440 --> 00:30:55.100
I should go?

00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:56.170
Yes.

00:30:56.400 --> 00:30:56.960
You should go.

00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:57.750
Hey,

00:30:58.440 --> 00:30:59.770
where is the messenger?

00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:00.750
Old Master Hu,

00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:03.180
he's waiting for your reply downstairs.

00:31:03.590 --> 00:31:04.160
Well,

00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:05.570
tell him this...

00:31:07.590 --> 00:31:08.640
Why did you...

00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:09.880
Why did you tear it up?

00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:10.720
Why did you tear it up?

00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:11.550
Yes.

00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:14.440
Yesterday,

00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:18.060
if that Li Million

00:31:18.510 --> 00:31:21.180
hadn't acted so overbearing,

00:31:22.350 --> 00:31:23.530
I would have sold him

00:31:23.750 --> 00:31:25.670
all the tea in the province

00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:27.350
for cheap.

00:31:28.310 --> 00:31:29.270
That was close.

00:31:32.150 --> 00:31:33.280
Where are you going?

00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:34.110
I

00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:35.900
didn't sleep well last night.

00:31:36.070 --> 00:31:37.070
I have a headache.

00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:39.550
If anyone comes looking for me,

00:31:39.550 --> 00:31:41.450
just say I'm unwell
and won't see visitors.

[Top Tea Under Heaven]

00:31:43.350 --> 00:31:44.350
After you go back,

00:31:45.510 --> 00:31:47.200
tell all your clerks

00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:48.480
not to sell

00:31:49.270 --> 00:31:51.960
a single ounce of tea today.

00:32:08.110 --> 00:32:08.750
Master.

00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:11.640
That Hu

00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:12.970
is still that stubborn?

00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:15.070
Yes.

00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:17.640
He hid away
under the pretext of recuperating,

00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:18.720
saying he had a headache

00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:20.450
and wouldn't see anyone today.

00:32:21.510 --> 00:32:23.300
I made a wrong move.

00:32:26.270 --> 00:32:27.720
I thought Hu

00:32:27.750 --> 00:32:29.480
was just arrogant and foolish,

00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:31.480
and I wanted to knock him down a notch

00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:32.960
to push the price lower.

00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:38.170
If I'd gone

00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:39.660
to that dinner last night,

00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:42.940
things would probably be settled by now.

00:32:43.300 --> 00:32:44.470
Let's wait

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:45.880
and see what miracle

00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:47.200
he can pull off.

00:32:53.070 --> 00:32:54.400
I've been thinking.

00:32:56.160 --> 00:32:58.290
I thought about it the whole afternoon

00:33:00.310 --> 00:33:02.170
and still couldn't figure it out.

taken care of the foreigners.

And everyone at the imperial court
is on our side.

00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:09.690
He has no room to make a move.

00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:11.240

Where is Qin?

00:33:39.030 --> 00:33:40.000
He's in his room.

I'm already this old,

00:33:45.350 --> 00:33:47.880
and I'm still competing with my own son.

00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:51.480
Let it be.

00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:55.210
I'm curious about the outcome.

00:33:56.250 --> 00:33:56.510
[Jinyang Villa, Shanxi]

00:33:56.510 --> 00:33:57.960
How did he make himself like this?

00:33:57.960 --> 00:33:59.090
Go get a doctor.

00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:00.370
Get the master here.

00:34:00.390 --> 00:34:00.920
Also,

00:34:01.510 --> 00:34:02.680
get Mr. Li here.

00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:03.400
Hurry.

00:34:27.590 --> 00:34:28.190
Mr. Gu.

00:34:29.030 --> 00:34:30.000
M-Mr. Li.

00:34:31.070 --> 00:34:32.280
You didn't have to
put yourself through this

00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:33.550
just to drink this wine.

00:34:33.550 --> 00:34:34.630
I finally made it.

00:34:35.230 --> 00:34:36.120
You're lucky.

00:34:36.510 --> 00:34:37.280
In one day

00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:38.230
I'll be on my way to Inner Mongolia.

00:34:38.230 --> 00:34:39.960
We almost missed each other.

00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:42.980
Master Jin,

00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:43.679
Madam Jin.

00:34:43.710 --> 00:34:44.670
I knew it.

00:34:44.760 --> 00:34:45.670
Don't you think

00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:46.730
our luck

00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:47.920
is getting better and better?

00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:48.800
Indeed.

00:34:49.150 --> 00:34:49.760
Yes.

00:34:51.110 --> 00:34:52.239
Please, take a seat.

00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:53.420
Alright, alright.

00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:54.480
Wencai told us to take our seats.

00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:55.480
This way, please.

00:34:55.510 --> 00:34:56.239
Come, Mr. Gu.

00:34:56.280 --> 00:34:57.280
This way, please.

00:34:57.710 --> 00:34:58.150
Okay.

00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:06.440
Mr. Li.

00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:11.500
What are you doing?

00:35:11.630 --> 00:35:12.230
I've never handled

00:35:12.230 --> 00:35:13.630
such a large deal before.

00:35:13.630 --> 00:35:15.440
Now the fate
of all the tea merchants in Anhui

00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:16.960
rests on me alone.

00:35:17.710 --> 00:35:18.440
So, Mr. Li,

00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:21.340
I really need your help this time.

00:35:25.450 --> 00:35:26.480
Come, sit down.

00:35:27.590 --> 00:35:28.260
I

00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:29.840
was just about to ask you.

00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:30.670
That thing of yours,

00:35:30.670 --> 00:35:31.920
the "Top Tea Under Heaven"—

00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:32.980
what exactly is it?

00:35:33.980 --> 00:35:35.670
I'm in the tea business myself,

00:35:35.670 --> 00:35:38.270
yet I didn't even know
what Orchid Snow tea was.

00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:39.720
Only after asking around

00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:41.160
did I find out it's yours.

00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:43.300
As long as you want it,

00:35:43.480 --> 00:35:44.360
I can supply as much as you need.

00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:44.920
Okay.

00:35:45.230 --> 00:35:46.160
It's a deal then.

00:35:46.710 --> 00:35:47.400
Now,

00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:49.160
let's talk business.

00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:50.380
What was it you said

00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:52.110
about Anhui tea?

00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:53.440
Here's the thing.

00:35:53.710 --> 00:35:55.320
Li Wantang got the exclusive rights

00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:57.110
to the tea trade between
the imperial court and the foreigners.

00:35:57.110 --> 00:35:58.880
He holds a grudge
because I ruined his plan

00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:00.150
at the Grand Tea Competition,

00:36:00.150 --> 00:36:01.150
and now he's determined

00:36:01.150 --> 00:36:02.670
to crush Anhui's tea business.

00:36:02.670 --> 00:36:04.230
I can't just sit and wait to die.

00:36:04.230 --> 00:36:04.710
I've decided

00:36:04.710 --> 00:36:05.840
to fight him.

00:36:08.570 --> 00:36:10.030
Li Million in the capital?

00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:22.070
He's not so impressive.

00:36:25.030 --> 00:36:26.450
Wencai means

00:36:26.550 --> 00:36:28.550
Li Million isn't anything special.

00:36:29.110 --> 00:36:30.690
That may be,

00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:32.360
but this time he got the exclusive rights

00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:33.590
to the tea trade

00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:35.440
between the imperial court
and the foreigners.

00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:36.230
This

00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:39.280
can't be solved with just money now.

00:36:40.710 --> 00:36:41.480
Mr. Li,

00:36:42.550 --> 00:36:44.950
for the sake
of all the tea farmers in Anhui,

00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:46.150
please help me.

00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:54.960
Okay.

00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:55.960
Bro,

00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:58.530
I'll take all of Anhui's tea this year.

00:36:59.030 --> 00:37:00.070
Worst case, I'll make

00:37:00.070 --> 00:37:01.230
a few more trips to Inner Mongolia.

00:37:01.230 --> 00:37:02.760
It will be sold eventually.

00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:03.360
Right?

00:37:04.230 --> 00:37:04.670
Mr. Gu,

00:37:04.710 --> 00:37:06.040
I still have to say this—

00:37:06.070 --> 00:37:07.440
for something this minor,

00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:08.800
you could've sent someone

00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:09.400
to tell us.

00:37:09.590 --> 00:37:11.330
Or you could've sent us a letter

00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:12.760
through any of our shops.

00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:15.030
Why did you have to come all the way
in person?

00:37:15.030 --> 00:37:16.550
Your health is more important.

00:37:16.550 --> 00:37:17.360
Don't end up

00:37:17.440 --> 00:37:18.550
getting sick all over,

00:37:18.550 --> 00:37:19.710
just like my husband.

00:37:19.710 --> 00:37:20.630
Then we really wouldn't be able

00:37:20.630 --> 00:37:21.890
to forgive ourselves.

00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:22.630
Yes.

00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:24.290
I know

00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:25.650
you truly care about me.

00:37:26.030 --> 00:37:26.770
But I can't

00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:27.590
dump every burden on your shoulders

00:37:27.590 --> 00:37:28.470
whenever

00:37:28.670 --> 00:37:30.190
I encounter something.

00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:33.860
As for this matter,

00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:35.030
I do have a few ideas

00:37:35.150 --> 00:37:36.510
we can discuss together.

00:37:36.510 --> 00:37:37.030
Okay.

00:37:37.710 --> 00:37:39.910
Although I only spent a day in Shanghai,

00:37:40.070 --> 00:37:41.190
I've come to believe

00:37:41.190 --> 00:37:42.630
that this so‑called
exclusive tea‑trade right

00:37:42.630 --> 00:37:43.920
isn't such a big deal.

00:37:44.710 --> 00:37:46.320
The imperial court has no real control

00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:48.050
over the foreigners nowadays.

00:37:48.110 --> 00:37:48.920
So I was thinking—

00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:50.050
could you support me

00:37:50.440 --> 00:37:52.500
in making a deal with the foreigners?

00:37:53.030 --> 00:37:53.630
Go ahead.

00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:55.840
According to my sources,

00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:57.480
the British East India Company

00:37:57.480 --> 00:37:58.510
is based in India.

00:37:59.000 --> 00:37:59.630
If we leave

00:37:59.630 --> 00:38:01.300
from Shiliupu Pier,

00:38:01.630 --> 00:38:03.630
pass through the Strait of Malacca,

00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:05.360
and then travel by sea
for another 2 days and nights,

00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:06.510
we can reach India.

00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:08.000
Tea sells

00:38:08.070 --> 00:38:09.380
extremely well there,

00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:11.320
and the price they pay is far higher

00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:12.840
than what the foreigners pay here

00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:13.880
in our country.

00:38:14.710 --> 00:38:15.970
So I've been thinking,

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:17.320
instead of relying on Xianghe Trade House

00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:18.920
to deal with the foreigners,

00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:20.290
why don't we sell our tea

00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:21.440
directly to India?

00:38:26.740 --> 00:38:28.510
I'm not dreaming.

00:38:29.030 --> 00:38:31.360
I've actually found
a few possible channels.

00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:32.360
We're listening.

00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:34.840
Before I say it,

00:38:35.930 --> 00:38:36.800
could you help me

00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:37.710
with one thing?

00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:41.010
Anhui tea can't wait even one more day.

00:38:41.230 --> 00:38:43.590
Li Wantang has gone mad with greed.

00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:45.480
He wants to swallow it in one bite.

00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:47.290
Could we find someone

00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:49.440
who can take over
all of Anhui's tea at once

00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:50.770
and ship it to Shanghai?

00:38:51.510 --> 00:38:53.190
Then I'll go to Shanghai with you,

00:38:53.190 --> 00:38:53.880
and from there

00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:56.340
we can make a trip to India.
What do you think?

00:38:59.150 --> 00:38:59.880
Mr. Li,

00:39:00.190 --> 00:39:01.360
your draft bank in Hefei

00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:02.820
hasn't opened yet, has it?

00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:04.250
Are you short

00:39:04.280 --> 00:39:05.190
on ready cash?

00:39:05.550 --> 00:39:06.350
How about

00:39:06.510 --> 00:39:07.510
I invest?

00:39:08.110 --> 00:39:09.110
You invest?

00:39:09.710 --> 00:39:11.110
There's no need for that.

00:39:11.710 --> 00:39:12.960
What I'm thinking is that

00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:13.760
we need someone

00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:15.020
with enough influence

00:39:15.190 --> 00:39:16.360
to take over all the Anhui tea—

00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:18.070
someone who can suppress Li Wantang
so thoroughly

00:39:18.070 --> 00:39:19.550
that he can only tuck his tail
between his legs

00:39:19.550 --> 00:39:21.210
and slink back to the capital.

00:39:22.150 --> 00:39:23.670
Only then will our Association Head's face

00:39:23.670 --> 00:39:24.400
stay intact.

00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:25.880
At a time like this,

00:39:25.880 --> 00:39:27.440
saving face doesn't even matter.

00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:28.040
No, no, no.

00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:29.800
Please wait for a moment.

00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:32.650
I'll arrange for someone
to deliver the message.

00:39:34.550 --> 00:39:35.110
Mr. Gu,

00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:38.070
how about I show you the garden?

00:39:38.630 --> 00:39:40.030
Let's go.

00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:41.840
He's doing that again—

00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:43.700
conducting business in silence.

00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:44.840
When you buy your coffin,

00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:45.960
let me invest.

00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:47.070
Fine.

00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:49.760
Mr. Gu,

00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:51.640
the water in this lake

00:39:51.670 --> 00:39:52.870
is from the Jin River.

00:39:53.150 --> 00:39:54.680
A feng shui master once said

00:39:55.280 --> 00:39:56.630
that it leads straight
to the Dragon Palace.

00:39:56.630 --> 00:39:57.400
Businessmen

00:39:57.800 --> 00:39:58.630
like auspicious symbols,

00:39:58.630 --> 00:39:59.390
so I named

00:39:59.510 --> 00:40:00.280
this place

00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:02.150
"Seven Treasures Garden."

00:40:03.510 --> 00:40:04.590
"Mountain spirits burn the alchemy stove,"

00:40:04.590 --> 00:40:05.880
"the Dragon King offers a treasure boat."

00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:07.810
This is a sign of world domination.

00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:13.650
Gu, you don't mean it sincerely.

00:40:16.070 --> 00:40:17.470
In such an elegant place,

00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:18.710
it would be a pity

00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:20.480
to talk business.

00:40:21.070 --> 00:40:21.880
But now,

00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:24.010
the Anhui Tea Merchants' Association

00:40:24.030 --> 00:40:25.710
is really at a critical point.

00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:28.110
If you could lend a hand

00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:29.820
and save us from disaster,

00:40:30.030 --> 00:40:31.360
wouldn't that kindness

00:40:31.550 --> 00:40:32.470
outweigh

00:40:32.470 --> 00:40:33.670
even the beauty before us?

00:40:33.670 --> 00:40:34.800
I never help anyone.

00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:36.550
Never.

00:40:37.590 --> 00:40:39.320
You can't show kindness.

00:40:40.190 --> 00:40:41.110
When a beggar

00:40:41.630 --> 00:40:42.690
calls out "Master,

00:40:42.710 --> 00:40:43.510
Madam"

00:40:43.710 --> 00:40:45.440
and receives a bowl of leftovers,

00:40:45.440 --> 00:40:46.550
it's only because of

00:40:46.550 --> 00:40:47.840
those two words.

00:40:50.070 --> 00:40:51.200
That's how business

00:40:51.630 --> 00:40:52.670
works.

00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:54.510
Mr. Gu,

00:40:54.920 --> 00:40:55.920
do you understand

00:40:56.280 --> 00:40:57.280
what I mean?

00:40:59.030 --> 00:40:59.760
Yes.

00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:02.590
Nothing in this world comes for free.

00:41:02.590 --> 00:41:04.190
If you beg with your face raised,

00:41:04.190 --> 00:41:05.360
you'll get nothing.

00:41:06.190 --> 00:41:06.880
Yes.

00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:10.150
This time,
Li Million got an imperial edict

00:41:10.150 --> 00:41:11.680
from a noble in the capital.

00:41:11.910 --> 00:41:13.480
With the authority of the imperial court,

00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:14.630
he wants to dominate

00:41:14.760 --> 00:41:17.070
the tea and medicine market
in the Southeast.

00:41:17.070 --> 00:41:18.320
If I act rashly

00:41:18.670 --> 00:41:19.800
on my own,

00:41:21.110 --> 00:41:22.240
would there be risk?

00:41:23.110 --> 00:41:23.760
Besides,

00:41:24.150 --> 00:41:25.280
overseas matters

00:41:25.550 --> 00:41:26.590
are uncertain.

00:41:27.150 --> 00:41:27.880
If I

00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:29.710
board an ocean liner

00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:30.770
and go out there,

00:41:31.030 --> 00:41:33.230
it would be like a human
stepping into a beast's den—

00:41:33.230 --> 00:41:34.560
how could I do business?

00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:36.480
Of course, for a friend,

00:41:36.840 --> 00:41:38.000
it's okay to take a risk,

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:40.060
but it can't be a long-term strategy.

00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:43.030
I'm a businessman.

00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:45.520
I have no reason to go against

00:41:45.710 --> 00:41:47.640
the imperial court and Li Million.

00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:49.490
As for which path should I take,

00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:52.060
I defer to your advice.

00:41:54.590 --> 00:41:56.320
You specialize in the tea trade

00:41:56.550 --> 00:41:58.110
and dominate the market in the Northwest.

00:41:58.110 --> 00:41:59.510
But if Li Wantang

00:41:59.590 --> 00:42:01.160
grabs the entire

00:42:01.190 --> 00:42:02.320
Southeast tea monopoly

00:42:02.320 --> 00:42:03.740
for himself,

00:42:03.880 --> 00:42:05.920
he will inevitably
become a great rival of yours.

00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:06.840
That's the first reason

00:42:06.840 --> 00:42:07.900
you should help me.

00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:10.030
This is a political talk.

00:42:11.710 --> 00:42:13.200
Nowadays, business

00:42:13.320 --> 00:42:14.710
is no longer like in the past,

00:42:14.710 --> 00:42:16.230
when merchants stayed in their lane

00:42:16.230 --> 00:42:16.960
and the imperial court

00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:18.490
could control everything.

00:42:19.230 --> 00:42:20.910
With the rebellion in Jiangnan,

00:42:20.910 --> 00:42:22.550
the regime's hold on local affairs

00:42:22.550 --> 00:42:23.510
is weakening.

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:25.400
This is a situation unseen

00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:26.760
in 300 years.

00:42:28.210 --> 00:42:29.740
Yet Li Wantang still thinks

00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:31.940
he can use the imperial court's power

00:42:32.070 --> 00:42:33.440
to suppress the provinces,

00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:35.640
imagining he can dominate everything.

00:42:36.070 --> 00:42:37.670
That thinking is outdated.

00:42:38.670 --> 00:42:40.070
Since we are in merchants' associations,

00:42:40.070 --> 00:42:41.430
we should join hands

00:42:41.480 --> 00:42:42.550
and make money together.

00:42:42.550 --> 00:42:43.750
If you are willing,

00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:45.270
I can offer Anhui tea

00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:46.610
at the lowest price

00:42:46.670 --> 00:42:48.870
and guarantee you a fixed yearly quota.

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:49.950
We can

00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:51.820
expand outward together—

00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:54.890
that's the real way to win.

00:42:55.150 --> 00:42:57.280
Why bother fighting among ourselves?

00:42:57.710 --> 00:42:58.510
Cooperation?

00:42:59.330 --> 00:43:00.250
That's good.

00:43:00.550 --> 00:43:01.400
Let's join forces

00:43:01.400 --> 00:43:02.440
and make money
from the foreigners together—

00:43:02.440 --> 00:43:03.070
wouldn't that be better?
