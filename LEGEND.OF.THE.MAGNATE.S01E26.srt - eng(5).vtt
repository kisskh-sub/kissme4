[Legend of the Magnate]

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:38.000
[Episode 26]

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:39.520
We should expand

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:41.900
our business outwards together—

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:44.680
only this is the way to success.

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.240
Why waste our efforts
in fighting each other?

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:48.150
Cooperation?

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:49.729
Sounds good.

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:50.870
Let's join forces

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:52.039
to make money from foreigners.

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.610
Isn't it nice?

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.229
The East India Company has monopolized

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:55.710
the tea trade and pharmaceutical industry

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:56.440
in East Asia.

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:58.150
It's a business colossus.

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.310
What do you think are my odds

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.110
of winning if I go confront them?

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:02.950
I'll probably

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:04.760
be chewed up and spit out.

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:06.790
How is it a business colossus,

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:08.789
since it's essentially a reseller?

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.560
If I were as capable as you are, Mr. Li,

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.240
I would definitely

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:12.370
fight them head-on.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.520
Or is it...

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:26.680
that you're losing courage

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:28.710
as you're getting older?

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.960
I have an idea—

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.730
to incite the tiger to eat the wolf.

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.360
That is,
to pit the foreigners against each other.

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.000
Old Master Hu should be awake now,
after sleeping

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.530
for a day and a night, right?

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.630
It no longer matters if he's awake or not.

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:51.630
The majority of the tea merchants

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:52.910
are now waiting outside

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:54.510
for a conversation with you.

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.520
Bypassing the tea merchants' association

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.400
to purchase tea leaves
from sellers one by one

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.730
is by no means possible.

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.200
Now that Old Master Hu is sick,

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:04.690
we should go visit him.

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:06.470
Son!

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.930
Let's go.

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:16.750
Good morning, Old Master Li.

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.440
Mr. Li is going to visit

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:24.730
the sick Old Master Hu.

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:26.090
Let's all join him.

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.030
Let's go.

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.320
Don't forget what we agreed on.

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:33.190
We must not tolerate it If Old Master Hu

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:34.800
still stubbornly sticks to his opinion.

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:35.930
This issue concerns

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:36.710
your lives and wealth.

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:37.240
Got it.

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:38.060
Smarten up.

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:39.120
Sure, sure.

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.280
I'll make proper arrangements now.

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.000
[Detachment]

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:47.630
Sir...

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:49.110
Send a message upstairs.

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:51.310
Just say Master Li Wantang
from the capital

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.000
is here to visit Old Master Hu.

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:54.310
Everyone,

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:55.370
let's go in.

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:56.990
Hold on, please!

00:03:57.079 --> 00:03:59.079
Allow me to notify the master first.

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:01.030
Come here, you.

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:02.630
What are you doing?

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:04.120
Cut this crap out!

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:05.630
Let's invite Mr. Li in.

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:06.560
Come on.

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:09.280
Master.

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:23.040
Keep up.

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:24.330
This is

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:25.360
all thanks to you.

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:26.360
Don't mention it.

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.190
Master Li, your presence here

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:31.100
is truly...

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:32.240
The visitor should call on the host first.

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:33.320
That's the rule.

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:34.630
Old Master Hu, upon hearing

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:35.630
about your ailments,

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:37.159
I decided to pay you a visit.

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:39.330
Shall we sit down and talk?

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.930
Let me introduce you to a new friend...

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.490
No need, Old Master Hu.

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.030
You must be Li Million from the capital.

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:47.360
I've heard much about you.

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:48.600
My surname is Wu.

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:49.780
I'm from Hangzhou.

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:54.090
Wu Caishen, the God of Wealth!

[Top Tea Under Heaven]

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:56.530
Please don't call me that.

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:57.100
I'm only running a small bank.

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:59.040
[A businessman from Zhejiang, Wu Caishen]

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.000
My friends gave me

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.240
that nickname as a compliment.

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:02.770
I dare not answer to it.

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:03.510
Come on.

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:04.810
Take a seat.

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.570
What?

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:07.600
Mr. Wu, do you plan to venture

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:08.740
into tea business?

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:10.500
I don't have what it takes.

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:12.870
I'm a silk merchant.

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:14.920
This time, I'm just helping a friend

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:16.190
to transport tea leaves.

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:16.790
That's why

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:18.360
I'm here asking Old Master Hu

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.190
for a favor.

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:20.560
Well, I'm so flattered.

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:21.690
What kind of favor?

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:24.040
Who has so big an appetite

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:25.650
to take all the tea leaves

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.380
of the entire Anhui province?

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:31.200
Mr. Wu, may I ask

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:33.040
who is this friend of yours?

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:35.270
How is he qualified to fight Mr. Li

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:36.630
over Anhui tea leaves?

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:39.680
To be honest,

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:40.750
I've never met

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:42.560
this man in person.

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:44.830
Despite all that, he and I have been

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:46.290
in contact for a long time.

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:48.560
I've heard positive comments about him

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:49.920
from many of my friends.

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:51.270
So, this time,

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:52.540
I'm happy to be of help

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:53.710
to him.

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:55.040
As for his name...

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:58.870
I have such a bad memory.

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:00.430
A carrier pigeon
brought me a note yesterday.

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:02.040
I recorded the content on my fan.

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:03.100
Let me check it out.

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:09.910
By order of Mr. Gu Pingyuan,

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:11.950
head
of Shanxi Merchants' Association,

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:13.240
silver bullion is needed

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:15.310
for the purchase of all the spring tea
that can be offered

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:16.830
by Anhui Tea Merchants' Association,

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:18.480
which shall be sent by sea

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:20.550
to Huating Shiliupu Pier.

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:23.240
Dear friend,
please help with it in your capacity.

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.190
I will thank you in person.

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:28.830
This good friend of mine

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:30.720
is the most influential tea merchant
in Shanxi.

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:31.510
I wonder...

00:06:32.409 --> 00:06:34.670
if he's qualified to make this purchase.

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:39.240
He's from the Eight Families.

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:40.700
A prominent figure as he is

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:43.000
even sells tea leaves
to as far as Mongolia.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.200
He's certainly qualified for the deal.

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:46.350
Mr. Wu, have you

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:48.740
already transported the tea leaves?

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:52.070
I wouldn't dare to postpone it, would I?

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:53.560
Of course it has been done.

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:56.510
Alright.

00:06:57.310 --> 00:06:58.120
Go on with your talk.

00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:59.510
I'm heading to Shiliupu Pier

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:00.560
to check things out.

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:01.240
Wait.

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:01.950
Stay for...

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:04.950
Something seems off.

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:07.090
Why must the tea leaves

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:08.890
be delivered to Shiliupu Pier?

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:11.490
For a business deal with foreigners?

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:13.920
Isn't it a blatant violation of the law

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:15.280
of the Qing government?

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:17.190
Master,

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:18.360
let's inform

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:19.920
the Shanghai authorities.

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:22.190
Such disrespect to the law

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:23.240
of the imperial court

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:24.160
is outrageous!

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:33.760
Thank you for saving me.

00:07:34.159 --> 00:07:35.250
I feel so honored.

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:36.290
I hope one day

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:37.380
I can go to India

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:38.830
with you, Captain.

00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:40.480
It's a real honor to have your support
this time.

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:41.510
And... they would like

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:42.480
to go to India

00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:43.560
with you together.

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:44.390
Come to India?

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:46.180
What a wonderful idea.

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:47.040
Sir,

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:49.270
I understand
that you believe this transaction...

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:49.950
The captain is saying

00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:52.350
that your visit to India
is warmly welcome,

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:54.430
and that he appreciates the generous

00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:55.340
shipping payment

00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:56.830
you've offered.

00:07:58.040 --> 00:07:59.390
He hopes to repay your kindness

00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:00.050
someday.

00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:01.110
Tell him this:

00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:02.920
as an old Chinese saying goes,

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:04.920
"reciprocity is always expected."

00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:05.920
If possible,

00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:08.490
we would very much like to do business

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:10.900
in the UK and other countries.

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:12.810
We hope that one day,

00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:14.770
we can afford a large ship

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:15.800
and bring him over

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:17.000
with it for a fun trip,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.000
after he retires.

00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:20.770
Chinese people say,

00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:22.660
"it's impolite not to return..."

00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:23.660
This black liquid

00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:24.830
tastes weird.

00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:26.610
Pretend to have got used to it.

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:28.430
This is killing me.

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:30.550
Don't they have tea here?

00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:32.960
British people drink tea

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:33.840
with milk.

00:08:33.909 --> 00:08:35.770
That'll make you feel even worse.

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:39.200
Captain!

00:08:39.559 --> 00:08:40.289
If I may...

00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:41.320
I must interrupt

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:43.720
your conversation
with these two Chinese gentlemen.

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:44.000
Sir,

00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:45.700
you come here for?

00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:46.840
Who is that?

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:50.200
Mr. Hart, from the customs office.

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:51.060
He's saying...

00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:52.360
that you, Mr. Gu, are

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:53.550
doing business with foreign merchants

00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:55.000
against the imperial court's orders.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:55.960
The customs office

00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:56.910
will not let this ship

00:08:56.910 --> 00:08:57.740
set sail.

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:01.400
This foreigner must be anxious,

00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:02.960
for trying to halt our ship.

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:03.960
This is a warship.

00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:06.210
How is he able to stop it from sailing?

00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:07.750
If I may...

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:10.270
Mr. Gu,

00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:12.600
you truly excel in

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:13.660
devising schemes.

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:15.960
You've even tricked the customs office

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:17.020
of the Qing Empire.

00:09:18.670 --> 00:09:19.360
I can't believe

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:21.200
this foreigner is so fluent in Mandarin!

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:22.870
You smell of vinegar.

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:24.170
There's no doubt

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:26.640
that you're a rustic Shanxi man.

00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:28.640
I-I...

00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:30.750
He's probably a better debater than you.

00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:31.680
Gu Pingyuan,

00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:33.320
Do you admit your guilt?

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:33.970
Sir,

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:35.780
what am I guilty of?

00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:38.050
Come with me. I'll tell you.

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:43.330
Gu Pingyuan.

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:45.840
I'm an official of the Qing Empire.

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:46.700
Do you admit it?

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:49.150
Of course I do.

00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:52.470
Greetings, Mr. Hart.

00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:56.510
Sir,

00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:57.750
did you drag me here

00:09:57.750 --> 00:09:59.390
just to assert your authority?

00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:00.850
This is your last warning.

00:10:00.890 --> 00:10:03.080
A family has its rules,
and so does a country.

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:05.680
You've offended the law
of the imperial court.

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:06.500
What?

00:10:06.910 --> 00:10:09.510
Are you done doing business
in the Qing Empire?

00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:11.510
Sir,

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:12.870
I don't get it.

00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:14.750
Please enlighten me.

00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:16.930
All the tea leaves,

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:18.550
medicine, porcelain, and silk

00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:20.610
exported by the Qing customs office

00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:22.550
are procured and sold
by the imperial court.

00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:23.630
This practice began

00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:24.550
in the Ming Dynasty.

00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:27.080
It has lasted for hundreds of years,
and still persists in the Qing Empire.

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:28.120
The trade used to be handled

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:30.120
by the Guangzhou 13 Trading Houses.

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:31.840
But due to the chaos in Jiangnan,

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:32.550
the imperial court

00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:34.480
has allowed designated personnel

00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:36.720
to make transactions
with foreign merchants in Shanghai.

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:37.880
I've never heard of

00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:39.080
an individual businessman making deals

00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:40.080
with foreigners.

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:41.770
If you insist on doing this,

00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:43.210
the customs office

00:10:43.390 --> 00:10:44.240
will arrest you,

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:45.320
beat you in the butt,

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:46.500
and behead you.

00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:48.030
Sir, a man of limited talent though I am,

00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:49.030
I've read a bit about

00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:51.030
the Elements of International Law.

00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:52.360
Imagine this scenario:

00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:54.170
Mr. Hart, suppose you bought

00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:55.510
a piece of porcelain

00:10:55.790 --> 00:10:57.670
from a Chinese merchant in private

00:10:57.670 --> 00:10:59.550
before returning to your homeland,

00:10:59.550 --> 00:11:01.030
would this Chinese merchant

00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:02.270
who made a transaction

00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:03.600
with you be prosecuted?

00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:05.590
No. That was a private purchase.

00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:07.320
Even if it were 1,000 or 10,000 pieces
of porcelain,

00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:08.150
the deal was still fine.

00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:09.510
That solves the problem here, right?

00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:10.630
The tea leaves in this ship

00:11:10.630 --> 00:11:11.450
were bought

00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:13.340
by the captain from us in private.

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:14.000
Here.

00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:14.960
Take a look.

00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:17.370
We even signed a contract.

00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:20.710
Everything's clearly stated in it.

00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:21.720
[Tea Business Operative Trade Contract]

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:23.250
So, this deal falls outside

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:25.510
the purview of the customs office.

00:11:25.510 --> 00:11:26.390
As for whom the captain

00:11:26.390 --> 00:11:28.120
would like to invite for a trip,

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:29.790
it's even further beyond your authority.

00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:30.520
Gu Pingyuan,

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.830
you're playing games with me.

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:34.660
It's only a clever turn of phrase.

00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:35.720
This barely means anything.

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:36.720
Why does a captain

00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:38.280
need these many tea leaves?

00:11:38.390 --> 00:11:38.910
No.

00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:39.810
Sir, you see,

00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:41.000
these tea leaves

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:41.210
have been through
customs clearance and tax payment.

00:11:41.210 --> 00:11:42.960
[Tea Business Operative Trade Contract]

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:44.420
As for the trading volume—

00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:45.930
it's not specified

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:47.720
in the law of the imperial court.

00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:48.790
You're taking advantage

00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:50.420
of legal loopholes.

00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:51.790
If others follow suit and sell

00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:52.670
tea leaves like you do,

00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:54.200
how should I deal with that?

00:11:54.950 --> 00:11:55.550
Sir,

00:11:55.870 --> 00:11:57.330
why not take a closer look?

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:02.700
Read this part.

00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:04.320
The selling of this batch

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:06.050
of tea leaves was made in Anhui.

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:07.980
What does it have to do with us?

00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:08.910
I also know a bit

00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:10.010
about British law.

00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:11.720
Free trade is allowed there.

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:13.470
The captain can do

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:15.200
whatever business he wants.

00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:16.470
Have I got the message

00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:18.200
across to you, sir?

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:21.620
This contract can't be valid.

00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:23.790
He'd sign it if you offered him 10 pounds.

00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:25.150
I-I'm going to sue him!

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:25.720
Okay!

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.000
Take him to court!

00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:30.820
My dear friend,

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:32.740
let's talk this out.

00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:35.680
Can you just cancel

00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:36.790
this deal?

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:40.060
"Dear friend"?

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:41.890
A friend of mine,

00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:43.600
who you met at my place previously,

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:44.630
is the procurement agent of tea leaves

00:12:44.630 --> 00:12:45.870
for the East India Company.

00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:46.870
He deeply regrets

00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:48.360
saying

00:12:48.390 --> 00:12:50.250
something disrespectful to you.

00:12:50.390 --> 00:12:51.000
What

00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:52.120
disrespectful things?

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:53.320
He took money from Li Million.

00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:54.450
The latter told him

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:56.270
that they could rake in more profits

00:12:56.270 --> 00:12:57.030
from Anhui tea

00:12:57.030 --> 00:12:58.510
if they ganged up on you tea merchants.

00:12:58.510 --> 00:12:59.720
But little did everyone

00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:01.030
expect that you could find a way

00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:01.910
to sell the tea leaves

00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:02.970
directly to India.

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:03.630
If...

00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:05.120
If the tea leaves truly arrive in India,

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:06.910
won't it be a giant slap
in the agent's face?

00:13:06.910 --> 00:13:07.600
He spent

00:13:07.630 --> 00:13:09.360
spent most of his life climbing

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:10.840
to his current position.

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:12.570
He can assure you

00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:13.720
that from now on,

00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:15.080
he'll purchase Anhui tea leaves

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:16.610
at the best price possible.

00:13:17.270 --> 00:13:19.170
You must not set a precedent.

00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:20.320
This batch of tea leaves

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:20.870
is no big deal.

00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:23.580
But shipping it
will destroy his reputation

00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:24.750
and career.

00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:26.080
But I'm only

00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:27.250
a tiny tea merchant.

00:13:27.790 --> 00:13:28.910
I don't represent the court,

00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:29.480
nor do I lead

00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:30.720
some tea merchants' association.

00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:32.430
Can my words make any difference?

00:13:32.430 --> 00:13:33.390
My dear friend,

00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:36.080
don't make things hard for me.

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:36.870
Take it as a win.

00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:38.550
Don't push me any further.

00:13:39.270 --> 00:13:40.330
As the saying goes,

00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:42.630

00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:44.470
and I scratch yours.

00:13:44.510 --> 00:13:45.240
Right?

00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:47.820
Sir, I...

00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:49.510
I admire how articulate you are

00:13:49.510 --> 00:13:50.510
even in Mandarin.

00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:51.700
How about this?

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:54.500
Tell your good friend

00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:56.720
that I'd include him in this deal.

00:13:57.030 --> 00:13:58.030
He can go to India

00:13:58.030 --> 00:13:58.960
with this shipment.

00:13:58.960 --> 00:13:59.520
However,

00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:01.750

00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:02.440
When we have

our own ship

00:14:03.790 --> 00:14:04.450
and expand

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:05.910
our tea business worldwide,

00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:06.640
maybe we will

00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:08.440
let him join us as a partner.

00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:11.420
What a satisfying answer.

00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:12.860
Good.

00:14:13.270 --> 00:14:13.870
Later on,

00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:15.750
sign a contract with him.

00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:17.240
My friend,

00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:19.690
if you were a British merchant,

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:20.910
I would really quit

and work as your partner.

We would be rolling in money.

Why can't that come true
when I'm a Chinese merchant?

00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:30.270
In the face of such powerful cannons,

00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:31.840
the oriental cleverness

00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:33.030
is useless.

I'm grateful for your help.

00:15:17.390 --> 00:15:18.920

Where is your friend?

00:15:21.550 --> 00:15:22.960
He said
he'd like to explore exotic lands,

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:25.160
so he'll stay on the ship and go to India.

00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:27.670
I'd better go say hello to him now.

00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:28.470
You guys talk.

All the credit goes to you, Mr. Gu.

We're like family.

These are bills of sales.

Well...

00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:48.750
Several twists in a day.

00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:50.410
If I were older,

00:15:50.630 --> 00:15:52.360
I'd be overwhelmed by you guys.

Look at his face.

This pleases me better than spring tea.

00:16:08.790 --> 00:16:10.840
Looks like he's about to
eat someone alive.

00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:12.640
As if he had the stomach for that.

00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:26.480
There will be a day

00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:28.650
when I buy a large ship

00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:31.650
and extend our tea business

00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:33.410
to the whole wide world.

Are you Gu Pingyuan?

Come with us!

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:17.589
How is it?

00:17:17.589 --> 00:17:18.790
Not as good as coffee.

00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:32.210
What happened?

00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:33.480
The Shanghai Bureau of Foreign Affairs

00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:36.280
has notified the customs office
to halt this ship.

00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:56.510
Captain.

00:17:59.510 --> 00:18:01.190
As this is a trade dispute,

00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:03.160
I will not interfere
or get involved in any way.

00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:03.710
This is

00:18:03.790 --> 00:18:05.270
defined as a trade dispute.

00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:06.470
The captain is saying

00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:08.440
that in principal, he won't intervene,

00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:10.310
so as to avoid any impacts on his job

00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:10.970
and career.

00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:11.880
Well...

00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:13.590
What does it mean?

00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:15.940
It means we're in a tricky situation.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:17.530
The only way to resolve this

00:18:17.590 --> 00:18:19.590
is to have it all dumped into the sea.

00:18:19.790 --> 00:18:20.830
What did he say now?

00:18:20.830 --> 00:18:21.630
He ordered...

00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:22.960
to have all these troublesome tea leaves

00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:24.090
thrown into the sea.

00:18:24.550 --> 00:18:25.270

00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:32.020

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:33.640
Tell them

00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:35.160
to stop now. Right now!

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:37.160
Say it!

00:18:38.110 --> 00:18:39.350
Are you even Chinese?

Tell them

I'll bear all the consequences.

00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:46.400
Next one!

00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:47.970
Stop it!

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:48.480
Stop!

00:18:48.510 --> 00:18:49.160
Stop it!

00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:50.000
Here.

00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:51.160
Stop it!

00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:52.070
Stop! Stop!

00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:52.720
Stop it!

00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:53.790
Stop!

00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:55.920
He said

00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:58.290
he would take all the responsibility.

00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:02.550
I don't see any man here
who can take all this responsibility.

00:19:02.550 --> 00:19:04.160
If you throw all the tea leaves
into the sea,

00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:05.590
you will be in bigger trouble!

00:19:05.590 --> 00:19:07.250
You will have bigger trouble.

00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:11.270
He's saying

00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:14.320
that if any disputes arise
in the customs office,

00:19:16.010 --> 00:19:17.590
without government orders,

00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:19.100
he won't intervene

00:19:19.210 --> 00:19:20.140
or get involved.

00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:21.920
This is only a dispute.

00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:23.880
There hasn't been a conclusion yet, right?

00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:26.310
Negotiation is needed
for every business deal.

00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:27.110
If it turns out

00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:28.350
there is no legal impropriety,

00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:30.550
you'll be held accountable
for your actions.

00:19:30.550 --> 00:19:32.510
You'll probably have to bid farewell

00:19:32.510 --> 00:19:34.200
to your ship for discarding all the goods!

00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:35.000
On top of that,

00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:36.700
you won't make a penny!

00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:38.240
You will get no money

00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:40.200
and won't see your boat anymore,

00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:42.240
due to discarding the tea.

00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:44.650
I dare say

00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:46.610
no one can guarantee me anything.

00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:49.660
He said no one could give him a guarantee.

00:19:49.790 --> 00:19:50.590
Guarantee?

00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:53.930

from doing anything.

00:20:03.690 --> 00:20:05.040

00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:09.550
than any other tea merchant in China.

00:20:09.550 --> 00:20:10.720
My assets...

00:20:11.070 --> 00:20:11.790
are sufficient

00:20:11.790 --> 00:20:12.760
enough to pay for

He wishes you not to be a coward.

00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:26.170
You think I'm a big coward, huh?

00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:29.160
Seems like our friends here

00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:30.310

00:20:32.470 --> 00:20:33.400

00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:48.440
As for the others, do not speak

00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:49.400
-unless you're called upon.
-Mr. Wu,

00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:50.530
you are an official?

00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:51.890
I just bought

00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:53.250
a random official post.

00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:54.850
My life's at stake now.

00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:57.240
Tell me what the Bureau
of Foreign Affairs has done—

00:21:57.240 --> 00:21:58.640
only the important part.

00:21:59.350 --> 00:22:00.550
This humble servant, Li Wantang,

00:22:00.550 --> 00:22:02.720
pays his respects to you, Intendant Liu.

00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:03.980
I have an official seal

00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:06.000
bestowed by the imperial court,

00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:07.330
which grants me the right

00:22:07.330 --> 00:22:07.480
[Approved by the Ministry of Revenue]

00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:09.410
to solely manage the export of tea.

00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:10.800
Li Wantang,

00:22:11.270 --> 00:22:12.160
you're being too modest.

00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:13.610
This young man

00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:15.780
has conspired with Shanxi merchants

00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:16.920
and secretly

00:22:17.110 --> 00:22:19.380
gone in glove with the captain

00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:21.280
of a British warship to ship

00:22:21.350 --> 00:22:22.950
tea leaves to India for sale.

00:22:23.350 --> 00:22:24.750
Isn't it against the law?

00:22:25.110 --> 00:22:26.040
Won't it turn

00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:28.400
the exclusive operating rights agreement
on tea trade

00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:29.960
between me and foreigners
into a dead letter?

00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:31.180
Intendant Liu,

00:22:31.790 --> 00:22:32.990
I beg you for justice.

00:22:35.110 --> 00:22:35.970
Intendant Liu,

00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:38.480
Mr. Hart and I just had a discussion,

00:22:38.590 --> 00:22:40.190
and he reviewed my contract.

00:22:40.750 --> 00:22:41.440
This foreigner

00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:44.070
I'm dealing with
only wants to buy some tea leaves

00:22:44.070 --> 00:22:45.200
and bring them home.

00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:46.440
Is it not allowed?

00:22:47.030 --> 00:22:48.270
Did anyone ask you to speak?

00:22:48.270 --> 00:22:49.640
Get him out and flog him!

00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:51.270
Why do you have to

00:22:51.270 --> 00:22:52.730
irritate him at this time?

00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:54.300
Intendant Liu,

00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:57.450
this young man you just lashed out at
doesn't hold

00:22:57.680 --> 00:22:58.920
an official position,

00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:00.030
but he is in fact

00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:01.600
somewhat an officer.

00:23:02.070 --> 00:23:03.660
The Empress Dowager

00:23:03.790 --> 00:23:06.130
personally appointed him to be

00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:07.960
the Pacification Commissioner of Hefei.

00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:09.710
He's no ordinary commoner.

00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:11.060
Intendant Liu,

00:23:11.310 --> 00:23:12.440
please reconsider.

00:23:16.340 --> 00:23:17.240
Keeping silent at this time

00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:18.680
is an admission of guilt, isn't it?

00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:19.880
You've been bringing

00:23:20.030 --> 00:23:21.480
trouble to the Bureau of Foreign Affairs.

00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:22.680
What is it do you want?

00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:24.920
This matter should be handled

00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:26.980
by the customs office in your charge.

00:23:27.070 --> 00:23:30.070
Indeed, the customs office
should take the lead on it.

00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:31.000
However,

00:23:31.510 --> 00:23:32.720
this young man's

00:23:32.750 --> 00:23:34.030
tea leaves

00:23:34.070 --> 00:23:36.240
were brought onto the ship in the name

00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:37.240
of a personal purchase

00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:39.280
upon completing legal procedures.

00:23:39.590 --> 00:23:41.250
I don't see any problems in it.

00:23:41.310 --> 00:23:42.810
It's just that Li Million

00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:43.940
disagrees with it.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:45.000
In this case,

00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:46.680
we need you to be the judge

00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:47.640
on this matter.

00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:49.050
A personal purchase

00:23:49.750 --> 00:23:51.680
of an entire province's tea leaves

00:23:51.790 --> 00:23:53.390
that can fill up a large ship?

00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:56.000
They're more than
the buyer can consume in a lifetime!

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:57.640
You guys mean to fool us.

00:23:57.680 --> 00:23:59.480
I don't believe any of that crap!

00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:02.480
Is it how the customs office works—

00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:03.410
through tricks?

00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:04.750
I supervise the customs affairs

00:24:04.750 --> 00:24:06.280
under the imperial decree.

00:24:06.550 --> 00:24:08.160
I'm coping with Li Million

00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:10.440
and Wu Caishen at the same time.

00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:11.480
You think I can

00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:13.280
afford to offend either of them?

00:24:13.830 --> 00:24:14.550
Besides,

00:24:14.790 --> 00:24:17.830
I can't find a single mistake
in Mr. Gu's business contract

00:24:17.830 --> 00:24:19.960
signed in compliance with
the court's regulations.

00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:21.640
That's why I'm handing over this matter
to the Bureau of Foreign Affairs

00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:22.970
for you to preside over.

00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:25.390
You hold a high position.

00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:26.720
Of course you can see farther

00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:27.680
than I can.

00:24:28.270 --> 00:24:28.930
You weasel.

00:24:30.270 --> 00:24:31.310
You old weasel.

00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:35.130
Mr. Li and Mr. Gu.

00:24:35.270 --> 00:24:35.930
Gentlemen?

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:43.800
Mr. Li, Mr. Gu,

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:45.920
you've really put me on the spot.

00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:47.680
You see,

00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:49.550
I'm fairly new to this position.

00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:51.590
I haven't learned much about trade.

00:24:52.750 --> 00:24:53.480
Can you two

00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:55.350
both make a concession?

00:24:57.110 --> 00:24:57.970
Intendant Liu,

00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:02.880
this is a valid golden seal
issued by the Ministry of Revenue.

00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:04.720
You cannot allow
such practice to take hold.

00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:06.380
If you let them pass this time,

00:25:06.510 --> 00:25:08.240
then everyone else will follow suit

00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:09.720
and trade with foreigners directly.

00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:11.640
What will become of the country
if nobody respects the exclusive rights

00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:13.070
granted by the imperial court?

00:25:13.070 --> 00:25:14.750
Making a fair judgement on this

00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:17.010
is easing the imperial court's worries.

00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:18.300
Intendant Liu,

00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:19.790
this batch of tea leaves

00:25:19.790 --> 00:25:21.520
is indeed a personal purchase.

00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:22.920
If you don't believe it,

00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:24.200
then put the captain of that gunboat

00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:25.000
on trial

00:25:25.270 --> 00:25:26.480
in the court of law.

00:25:26.750 --> 00:25:28.420
Should he dare to lie,

00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:29.750
have him taken down

00:25:30.030 --> 00:25:30.760
and flogged.

00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:31.880
What right do I have

00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:32.680
to punish him?

00:25:33.590 --> 00:25:34.920
If another war is triggered by it,

00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:36.790
won't I be dismissed from my position?

00:25:36.790 --> 00:25:37.830
That's a point.

00:25:39.070 --> 00:25:39.640
Intendant Liu,

00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:41.720
please examine into this matter carefully.

00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:43.790
There are loopholes
in the law of the imperial court.

00:25:43.790 --> 00:25:44.830
You can't let these people

00:25:44.830 --> 00:25:46.160
take advantage of them.

00:25:46.550 --> 00:25:47.870
The position you're in requires you

00:25:47.870 --> 00:25:48.930
to uphold justice,

00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:51.020
so as to reassure the imperial court.

00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:52.680
How cunning.

00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:55.890
Can't you both take a step back,

00:25:56.350 --> 00:25:57.700
or negotiate again?

00:25:57.790 --> 00:25:58.400
Okay!

00:25:59.200 --> 00:25:59.830
Okay.

00:26:04.790 --> 00:26:05.320
Alright.

00:26:05.330 --> 00:26:07.010
It's time to stop the fuss.

00:26:07.270 --> 00:26:08.310
Why should I stop?

00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:11.560
Young man,

00:26:11.790 --> 00:26:13.450
can't you be good and grow tea?

00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:15.720
Haven't you suffered

00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:16.850
enough in Ningguta?

00:26:17.550 --> 00:26:19.210
Alright. Stop the kerfuffle.

00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:21.040
I've been pushed this far by you.

00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:23.070
It'll destroy the lives
of many Anhui tea merchants

00:26:23.070 --> 00:26:24.440
if their spring tea doesn't sell.

00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:26.040
I'll back off if you back off.

00:26:34.750 --> 00:26:35.350
Hu.

00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:37.240
Hu!

00:26:37.750 --> 00:26:38.590
Come here.

00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:43.310
Mr. Li.

00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:44.850
No need for this.

00:26:45.350 --> 00:26:47.080
Any word that is given here today

00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:48.030
must be kept.

00:26:48.750 --> 00:26:50.080
Get the tea leaves back.

00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:51.580
All Anhui spring tea

00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:53.430
will be paid at the usual price.

00:26:53.590 --> 00:26:54.200
Is it okay?

00:26:54.590 --> 00:26:55.400
About that...

00:26:56.130 --> 00:26:57.520
Mr. Gu has the final say.

00:27:01.450 --> 00:27:02.980
I'll raise the price by 10%,

00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:04.780
if you withdraw the shipment.

00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:12.720
It's too late.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:14.110
If I withdraw it now,

00:27:14.110 --> 00:27:16.590
I'll be condemned
as a dishonest businessman.

00:27:16.590 --> 00:27:18.290
All tea merchants in Anhui

00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:20.220
follow Mr. Gu's lead.

00:27:20.350 --> 00:27:21.270
Do you even hear

00:27:21.310 --> 00:27:22.520
what you're saying?

00:27:22.750 --> 00:27:23.480
Do you?

00:27:25.030 --> 00:27:26.480
He's just a young man,

00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:29.440
while you're head
of the Tea Merchant's Association.

00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:30.640
Which matters more, he alone

00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:32.150
or the lives of all Anhui tea merchants?

00:27:32.150 --> 00:27:33.950
Are you getting old and foolish?

00:27:34.830 --> 00:27:35.440
Mr. Li,

00:27:36.110 --> 00:27:37.380
I prioritize trust

00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:39.270
in everything I do.

00:27:39.830 --> 00:27:40.680
Let me be clear—

00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:42.200
even if Mr. Gu told

00:27:42.270 --> 00:27:43.810
all Anhui tea merchants

00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:46.030
to jump into a pit of fire now,

00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:47.200
I'd do it.

00:27:52.510 --> 00:27:53.070
Fine.

00:27:54.590 --> 00:27:56.160
Very fine.

00:27:58.200 --> 00:27:59.270
The tea can't be withdrawn now, right?

00:27:59.270 --> 00:28:00.200
If I had agreed to it,

00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:01.790
I would've fallen into his trap.

00:28:01.790 --> 00:28:02.400
Report!

00:28:14.550 --> 00:28:15.170
Are you

00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:16.460
trying to get me fired?

00:28:48.070 --> 00:28:49.590
An anti-smuggling ship
of the customs office

00:28:49.590 --> 00:28:51.160
has intercepted that warship.

00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:52.510
But the people on the warship

00:28:52.510 --> 00:28:54.160
reject any customs inspection.

00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:55.270
With the cover lifted,

00:28:55.270 --> 00:28:56.680
their cannon is ready to shoot.

00:28:56.680 --> 00:28:57.440
Now,

00:28:57.720 --> 00:28:59.300
I think we've hit the point

00:28:59.510 --> 00:29:00.550
of no return.

00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:02.180
It's all set.

00:29:02.310 --> 00:29:03.310
They'll open fire

00:29:04.030 --> 00:29:04.760
in two hours.

00:29:06.350 --> 00:29:07.000
Have you

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:08.480
reached a conclusion yet?

00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:16.120
Intendant Liu, Mr. Hart,

00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:18.240
if you let them pass today,

00:29:18.350 --> 00:29:19.450
I will take this

00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:21.820
to the prince and the Ministry of Revenue

00:29:22.270 --> 00:29:23.400
and ask for a ruling.

00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:24.280
Fine.

00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:26.180
Ask them for a ruling then.

00:29:27.070 --> 00:29:28.320
A ruling?

00:29:28.890 --> 00:29:30.240
Once the gunboat opens fire,

00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:31.750
everyone on the anti-smuggling ship

00:29:31.750 --> 00:29:32.590
will die.

00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:33.970
This is

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:35.640
a serious moment.

00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:37.200
Any exchange of fire will unleash hell,

00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:40.240
since they're still within the borders
of the Qing Empire.

00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:40.920
Li Million,

00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:43.170
will you take a step back or not?

00:29:57.590 --> 00:29:59.240
You seem to be more audacious
than Zhao Zilong,

00:29:59.240 --> 00:30:00.030
an ancient warrior

00:30:00.030 --> 00:30:01.360
renowned for his valor!

00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:03.160
The Bureau of Foreign Affairs
is a government office.

00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:05.270
Let's respect the golden seal
issued by the imperial court.

00:30:05.270 --> 00:30:06.090
Li Million,

00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:07.550
if you insist on halting the warship,

00:30:07.550 --> 00:30:08.720
then go ahead.

00:30:08.830 --> 00:30:09.830
Should there be serious consequences,

00:30:09.830 --> 00:30:11.200
you will answer to the Ministry of Revenue

00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:13.260
and the prince with that golden seal!

00:30:39.550 --> 00:30:42.030
Those enemy trading ships have withdrawn!

00:30:42.060 --> 00:30:43.000
Cease fire!

00:30:43.310 --> 00:30:44.510
Cease fire!

00:30:44.670 --> 00:30:45.610
Prepare to sail!

00:30:45.750 --> 00:30:46.880
Prepare to sail!

00:30:51.270 --> 00:30:52.130
What did he say?

00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:54.570
The opposing forces' ships have quit.

00:30:54.590 --> 00:30:55.200
Really?

00:30:55.350 --> 00:30:56.610
I'm coming down to you!

00:31:07.790 --> 00:31:09.480
This is a historic first!

00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:13.230
Congratulations in advance, Mr. Li.

00:31:13.230 --> 00:31:13.880
On what?

00:31:14.310 --> 00:31:15.240
These tea leaves

00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:16.910
will be sold at amazing prices in India.

00:31:16.910 --> 00:31:17.910
This transaction

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:19.600
has enraged some Chinese...

00:31:19.940 --> 00:31:21.200
and also some British.

00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:24.000
Isn't it a historic first?

00:31:33.310 --> 00:31:35.410
Gu Pingyuan is truly smart.

00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:37.350
If I had known,

00:31:37.350 --> 00:31:38.770
I would've made him stay

00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:40.510
in Ningguta forever.

00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:42.440
Master,

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:44.880
what's done can't be undone.

00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:48.270
I've raised a viper

00:31:48.270 --> 00:31:49.500
to harm myself.

00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:52.000
Every time it escapes death,

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:53.800
its venomous fangs grow longer.

00:31:55.030 --> 00:31:57.270
It happens because of your sense of mercy.

00:31:57.270 --> 00:31:58.200
It's the first time

00:31:58.200 --> 00:32:00.060
I've been complimented that way.

00:32:00.070 --> 00:32:00.930
Think about it.

00:32:01.350 --> 00:32:02.160
Today,

00:32:02.270 --> 00:32:03.350
you could've adamantly

00:32:03.350 --> 00:32:05.200
ordered to intercept the tea leaves—

00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:07.030
all hung on a single thought of yours.

00:32:07.030 --> 00:32:08.510
If that resulted in a disaster,

00:32:08.510 --> 00:32:09.880
we could survive it,

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:10.610
but

00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:12.510
that young man would be crushed, right?

00:32:12.510 --> 00:32:14.020
So, he's still alive now

00:32:14.070 --> 00:32:15.750
exactly because of your sense of mercy.

00:32:15.750 --> 00:32:16.770
What is mercy?

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:18.000
What does it mean?

00:32:19.510 --> 00:32:20.960
-Madam Jin.
-Get me my jade bowls!

00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:22.920
This must be the wine

00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:24.020
you treasure most.

00:32:24.550 --> 00:32:26.880
Its aroma is seeping
out of the sealed jar.

00:32:30.170 --> 00:32:30.790
Smell it.

00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:33.880
What a lovely scent.

00:32:36.950 --> 00:32:37.950
Thank you, Madam.

00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:45.680
As the Association Head,

00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:47.010
you should drink first.

00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:48.870
Everyone,

00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:50.830
I never

00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:51.810
play by the book.

00:32:51.950 --> 00:32:52.990
I've come this far

00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:54.920
thanks to your support.

00:32:55.170 --> 00:32:56.400
Your kindness will forever

00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:57.530
engraved in my mind.

00:32:57.640 --> 00:32:58.110
Cheers.

00:32:58.400 --> 00:32:58.920
Cheers.

00:32:59.110 --> 00:32:59.680
Cheers.

00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:10.350
I've tasted

00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:11.910
many kinds of fruit wine.

00:33:12.110 --> 00:33:13.570
But what I'm drinking now—

00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:14.750
so fruity and not sour at all—

00:33:14.750 --> 00:33:15.610
is rarely seen.

00:33:16.110 --> 00:33:17.710
It's a pity that we can't wait

00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:19.440
till Mr. Li comes back to enjoy

00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:20.620
such good wine together.

00:33:20.620 --> 00:33:21.860
Silly you.

00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:23.630
This wine

00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:25.380
belongs to Mr. Li.

00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:26.830
He got it as a gift

00:33:26.830 --> 00:33:27.960
from some French merchants

00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:28.590
during a delivery

00:33:28.590 --> 00:33:30.050
of tea leaves to Xinjiang.

00:33:30.110 --> 00:33:31.730
The merchants
planned to buy a piece of land

00:33:31.730 --> 00:33:33.910
in Turpan to grow grapes and make wine.

00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:36.240
These few jars are samples.

00:33:36.310 --> 00:33:37.710
Drink as much as you like.

00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:38.680
Mr. Gu,

00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:40.070
do you know

00:33:40.070 --> 00:33:42.200
why we invited you over from Shanghai?

00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:44.240
Why?

00:33:44.790 --> 00:33:46.750
We provided some assistance
with the matter

00:33:46.750 --> 00:33:48.350
concerning Anhui tea merchants.

00:33:48.350 --> 00:33:49.200
In return,

00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:51.270
you helped us make a fortune.

00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:52.790
That said,

00:33:53.110 --> 00:33:54.510
as the Association Head,

00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:56.790
you're responsible to help us

00:33:57.510 --> 00:33:59.550
earn something else than money, right?

00:33:59.550 --> 00:34:00.110
Right.

00:34:00.590 --> 00:34:01.990
We're not short of money.

00:34:05.390 --> 00:34:07.070
It's not that easy
to be the Association Head.

00:34:07.070 --> 00:34:08.070
You have to be a role model

00:34:08.070 --> 00:34:09.800
in both character and conduct.

00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:10.540
Mr. Gu,

00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:12.270
you did one thing

00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:14.060
that I find admirable.

00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:17.960
What is it, Madam?

00:34:18.550 --> 00:34:20.280
I heard a marriage was arranged

00:34:20.550 --> 00:34:22.510
for you in Anhui when you were little.

00:34:22.510 --> 00:34:23.710
Then it was canceled.

00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:24.840
Later on, you met

00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:26.670
a girl from Shanxi, our hometown.

00:34:26.670 --> 00:34:28.070
Because of you, she has decided

00:34:28.070 --> 00:34:30.719
to remain single all her life
to take care of her father.

00:34:30.719 --> 00:34:31.960
This is not quite fair to her,

00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:33.530
a Shanxi fellow of ours?

00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:34.360
No.

00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:35.020
No...

00:34:35.110 --> 00:34:35.920
Is it true?

00:34:39.630 --> 00:34:40.679
Mr. Gu is young.

00:34:40.710 --> 00:34:41.670
He'd like to exude his charm elsewhere.

00:34:41.670 --> 00:34:43.400
This is not entirely his fault.

00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:44.230
Shut up.

00:34:45.550 --> 00:34:46.150
Do you think

00:34:46.150 --> 00:34:46.960
Mr. Gu is like you?

00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:48.190
You can't even keep count of

00:34:48.190 --> 00:34:48.670
your wives,

00:34:48.670 --> 00:34:49.590
children, and money!

00:34:49.590 --> 00:34:50.550
If he was like you,

00:34:50.550 --> 00:34:51.630
I would just ignore him.

00:34:51.630 --> 00:34:52.360
Mr. Gu,

00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:53.380
be a good man,

00:34:53.630 --> 00:34:54.920
and don't learn from him.

00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:55.840
Why are we suddenly

00:34:55.840 --> 00:34:57.000
talking about me now?

00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:57.630
I'll drink.

00:34:57.630 --> 00:34:59.150
You continue talking to him.

00:34:59.150 --> 00:34:59.800
Madam,

00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:01.980
the girl you're talking about

00:35:02.150 --> 00:35:03.550
is Chang Yu'er, right?

00:35:04.710 --> 00:35:05.430
She knows

00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:06.960
I was once engaged

00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:08.090
back in my hometown.

00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:10.740
But wasn't it canceled in the end?

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:12.800
Why are you bringing it up again?

00:35:15.070 --> 00:35:16.680
It's perfectly normal

00:35:17.150 --> 00:35:21.480
for a man to take several wives
and concubines, right?

00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:26.600
Say it again. I'd like to hear it.

00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:27.440
My love,

00:35:27.510 --> 00:35:28.550
I'm a bit drunk

00:35:28.590 --> 00:35:29.450
from that wine.

00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:31.070
It has got in my head.

00:35:31.090 --> 00:35:31.800
Dizzy.

00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:34.070
I heard this Shanxi girl

00:35:34.090 --> 00:35:35.810
came from afar to save you.

00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:37.550
She's deeply in love with you.

00:35:37.550 --> 00:35:39.350
What exactly are you going to do?

00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:44.660
Say something.

00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:47.860
What do you think you are,
a piece of ginseng?

00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:49.420
I will treat her...

00:35:50.630 --> 00:35:51.510
with proper etiquette.

00:35:51.510 --> 00:35:52.000
Bah!

00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:53.510
What proper etiquette?

00:35:53.510 --> 00:35:54.840
Don't you feel guilty at all?

00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:55.550
Why did you voluntarily

00:35:55.550 --> 00:35:56.070
risk your life

00:35:56.070 --> 00:35:57.270
to save her father's?

00:35:57.360 --> 00:35:58.890
Her father is my lifesaver.

00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:00.510
Do you think you're keeping accounts

00:36:00.510 --> 00:36:01.550
here as a businessman,

00:36:01.550 --> 00:36:03.010
noting each transaction clearly?

00:36:03.010 --> 00:36:03.840
My silly friend,

00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:04.480
things

00:36:04.550 --> 00:36:07.590
between men and women
are inextricable tangles in nature.

00:36:07.590 --> 00:36:09.130
How can they be sorted out?

00:36:10.230 --> 00:36:11.360
What's on your mind?

00:36:11.510 --> 00:36:12.850
Do you have a plan?

00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:16.000
It's been a long enough time.

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:18.130
How much longer do you want to stall it?

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:26.600
I'm running out of patience.

00:36:27.190 --> 00:36:28.760
Look at my friend Mr. Gu here.

00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:31.110
He survived the attacks of people

00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:33.740
and wolves in Ningguta.

00:36:35.030 --> 00:36:37.110
Yet when it comes to his marriage...

00:36:38.150 --> 00:36:39.480
Are you unable to speak now?

00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:40.030
No.

00:36:40.510 --> 00:36:41.440
I'm afraid that she doesn't

00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:42.550
think I'm good enough.

00:36:42.550 --> 00:36:44.280
You're indeed not good enough.

00:36:46.710 --> 00:36:47.540
Madam,

00:36:48.070 --> 00:36:49.470
when I parted with Yu'er,

00:36:49.550 --> 00:36:51.610
she knew I was going back to Anhui

00:36:51.690 --> 00:36:52.890
to marry the girl

00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:54.880
I was engaged to at that time.

00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:55.590
But that girl

00:36:55.590 --> 00:36:57.070
married someone else in the end.

00:36:57.070 --> 00:36:58.070
If, at this moment,

00:36:58.070 --> 00:36:59.790
I go back to Yu'er,

00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:01.050
what will she think?

00:37:01.070 --> 00:37:01.760
Won't she think

00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:03.010
I don't cherish her enough?

00:37:03.010 --> 00:37:04.000
What right did I have

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:05.330
to make her wait so long?

00:37:05.670 --> 00:37:06.310
Besides,

00:37:06.510 --> 00:37:07.280
if one day

00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:08.190
I'm forced to revert

00:37:08.190 --> 00:37:09.440
to my old life of harship,

00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:10.840
how will that leave her?

00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:15.490
However,

00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:17.870
you can't keep

00:37:17.960 --> 00:37:20.280
Miss Chang waiting

00:37:20.630 --> 00:37:22.360
forever for you.

00:37:23.590 --> 00:37:24.670
That's right.

00:37:26.070 --> 00:37:27.640
Shouldn't we

00:37:27.710 --> 00:37:29.640
find a good husband

00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:32.390
for her?

00:37:33.630 --> 00:37:36.000
How sensible my husband is.

00:37:37.010 --> 00:37:38.540
The purpose of this meeting

00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:40.740
is getting a confirmation from you.

00:37:43.030 --> 00:37:44.030
I have actually found

00:37:44.030 --> 00:37:45.540
an eligible bachelor for Miss Chang.

00:37:45.540 --> 00:37:47.480
He can propose marriage to her tomorrow.

00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:48.040
Mr. Gu,

00:37:48.070 --> 00:37:49.030
just say a word,

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:52.140
and we'll be there to help you.

00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:54.960
This long-standing problem
has been solved now.

00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:55.920
To Mr. Gu!

00:37:56.400 --> 00:37:57.800
This is what we should do.

00:37:58.030 --> 00:37:58.960
Hold on.

00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:01.070
Well, I...

00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:03.460
I don't think it's a good idea.

00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:05.810
How is it not a good idea?

00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:08.110
You've decided to treat her
with proper etiquette.

00:38:08.110 --> 00:38:08.920
You can't stop her

00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:10.150
from marrying someone else, can you?

00:38:10.150 --> 00:38:11.810
Aren't you being too selfish?

00:38:15.550 --> 00:38:17.280
What is it do you want?

00:38:26.070 --> 00:38:26.710
Alright.

00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:29.810
Today, we're gathered with good friends.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:30.760
Fine wine is on the table.

00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:31.550
Come on.

00:38:31.590 --> 00:38:32.510
Let's raise our glasses.

00:38:32.510 --> 00:38:33.000
Come on!

00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:34.450
Cheers to

00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:36.110
solving a big problem for Mr. Gu.

00:38:36.110 --> 00:38:36.570
Come on.

00:38:36.630 --> 00:38:37.480
Smell the wine.

00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:38.590
Drink up.

00:38:38.630 --> 00:38:39.690
-Come on.
-Come on.

00:38:39.710 --> 00:38:40.110
No, no, no!

00:38:40.110 --> 00:38:41.050
Wait a moment.

00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:43.060
Put this matter aside for now.

00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:45.850
I'll go meet her right away.

00:38:46.190 --> 00:38:47.320
I need to make things

00:38:47.590 --> 00:38:49.250
clear with her face-to-face.

00:38:50.150 --> 00:38:51.360
Such good wine.

00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:52.560
It really is.

00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:53.550
Come on.

00:38:53.550 --> 00:38:54.700
Would you like more?

00:38:54.920 --> 00:38:55.960
Come on.

00:38:56.590 --> 00:38:57.710
What do you think of the smell?

00:38:57.710 --> 00:38:58.640
Terrific.

00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:02.550
Madam,

00:39:04.030 --> 00:39:05.800
you've found a bachelor for her already?

00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:06.440
Is it true?

00:39:09.630 --> 00:39:10.710
He really needs

00:39:10.710 --> 00:39:11.510
a little push.

00:39:13.110 --> 00:39:14.370
His care for Miss Chang

00:39:14.550 --> 00:39:16.480
just threw him into a panic, right?

00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:18.030
We had no other choice

00:39:18.030 --> 00:39:19.210
but to push you.

00:39:19.630 --> 00:39:21.240
What else could we do?

00:39:21.320 --> 00:39:22.190
We're unable to trick you.

00:39:22.190 --> 00:39:22.720
Alright.

00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:23.560
It's settled.

00:39:23.590 --> 00:39:24.550
Sit down and drink.

00:39:24.550 --> 00:39:25.440
Let's go on with our talk.

00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:26.550
How is it a good time for drinks now?

00:39:26.550 --> 00:39:27.030
I...

00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:29.590
I'd better propose marriage to her now.

00:39:29.590 --> 00:39:31.390
But before that, I need to go back

00:39:31.550 --> 00:39:33.670
to Anhui and discuss it with my mother.

00:39:33.670 --> 00:39:35.070
I must get well prepared.

00:39:35.070 --> 00:39:36.760
I should get going right away.

00:39:37.230 --> 00:39:37.880
Great!

00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:39.820
This entire night,

00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:42.260
you've finally said one thing right.

00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:44.320
A horse carriage
has been prepared for you.

00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:46.030
Just set off when the city gate opens

00:39:46.030 --> 00:39:47.840
tomorrow morning,
and you'll be home within one day.

00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:48.760
When you get home,

00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:49.840
you'll have to

00:39:49.880 --> 00:39:51.010
depend on yourself.

00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:53.160
We've done what friends should.

00:39:53.400 --> 00:39:54.840
You're no longer a scholar.

00:39:54.840 --> 00:39:56.590
So free yourself of those

00:39:56.760 --> 00:39:58.280
silly dorks' principles,

00:39:58.320 --> 00:39:59.150
will you?

00:40:03.030 --> 00:40:03.670
Madam,

00:40:07.030 --> 00:40:08.590
thank you for the kind reminder.

00:40:08.590 --> 00:40:11.250
Or Yu'er and I would've
missed out on each other.

00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:18.960
Pingyuan,

00:40:19.190 --> 00:40:19.880
bad news!

00:40:20.230 --> 00:40:21.560
Mother wants to see you.

00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:31.960
Mother.

00:40:32.840 --> 00:40:33.570
You're back.

00:40:34.550 --> 00:40:36.630
I heard you hurriedly rush in.

00:40:37.320 --> 00:40:38.840
Pingwen told me there was bad news.

00:40:38.840 --> 00:40:40.100
That really scared me.

00:40:40.710 --> 00:40:41.730
Where is Ms. Bai?

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:42.900
What Ms. Bai?

00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:43.920
Mother,

00:40:44.230 --> 00:40:44.960
I mean Yimei.

00:40:50.650 --> 00:40:52.010
She woke up and left.

00:40:53.800 --> 00:40:55.600
I couldn't persuade her to stay.

00:40:56.480 --> 00:40:57.440
She told us

00:40:59.230 --> 00:41:01.070
not to mention her name anymore,

00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:04.400
or our family might get in trouble.

00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:07.800
Ms. Bai no longer exists in the world.

00:41:11.150 --> 00:41:12.230
How could we let her

00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:13.760
leave alone?

00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:15.950
That was what she wanted.

00:41:16.110 --> 00:41:18.100
We can't make her stay.

00:41:18.150 --> 00:41:19.320
Just leave her be.

00:41:20.190 --> 00:41:21.450
I want to keep her here.

00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:22.960
It's not

00:41:22.980 --> 00:41:24.110
because I fancy her,

00:41:24.630 --> 00:41:26.290
but because I promised Mr. Bai

00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:28.490
to protect her all her life.

00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:31.240
Just like that, she left.

00:41:31.590 --> 00:41:32.400
In this vast world,

00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:33.530
where can I find her?

00:41:37.510 --> 00:41:38.400
She left

00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:41.690
because she doesn't want to see you again.

00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:44.820
She'll absolutely object

00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:46.340
to getting married again,

00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:49.510
and even more to being a freeloader here,

00:41:49.510 --> 00:41:51.400
idling her time away and getting old.

00:41:51.400 --> 00:41:53.030
Don't you think?

00:41:54.030 --> 00:41:55.230
Just leave her be.

00:41:57.280 --> 00:41:59.070
It's time you learned to let go.

00:42:00.030 --> 00:42:02.550
All good things must come to an end.

00:42:06.840 --> 00:42:08.500
Let's go visit Mr. Bai's tomb.

00:42:13.550 --> 00:42:14.190
Mother,

00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:15.800
what did Yimei say

00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:16.840
when she left?

00:42:22.630 --> 00:42:24.570
She said
she refused to live under anyone's roof,

00:42:24.570 --> 00:42:25.880
[Mr. Bai Shi'an's Tomb]

00:42:25.880 --> 00:42:28.080
and that she would lead a life of her own.

00:42:39.840 --> 00:42:41.300
A weak woman though she is,

00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:43.860
she has more grit than I do.

00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:46.960
[Mr. Bai Shi'an's Tomb]

00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:47.590
Mr. Bai,

00:42:48.190 --> 00:42:49.320
you heard it, right?

00:42:50.510 --> 00:42:51.360
Don't worry.

00:42:52.550 --> 00:42:53.590
Yimei is a blessed girl.

00:42:53.590 --> 00:42:54.520
She will be fine.

00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:57.600
Mother and I are leaving now.

00:42:58.920 --> 00:43:00.650
When I get any news about Yimei,

00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:02.800
I'll visit your tomb again.
