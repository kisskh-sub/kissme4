(The Palace
Imperial Study)

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.079
I, Gan Sheng, request an audience
with Your Majesty.

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.090
There is an urgent matter
that requires discussion.

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.040
His Majesty is unwell
and has already retired.

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.000
General Gan, please return another day.

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:02.799
If His Majesty is ill,

00:02:02.879 --> 00:02:04.959
then I should all the more pay a visit.

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.160
His Majesty has barely fallen sick,

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:12.800
yet you rush into the palace so hastily

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.800
that I cannot even keep up appearances.

00:02:14.919 --> 00:02:16.159
If I allow you inside,

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.080
the civil officials
will use it against us.

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.319
Whatever the matter is,
can you not discuss it with me first?

00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:33.080
I came today to ask something.

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:36.039
The tribute from Nanjiang
has already arrived.

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.000
How does His Majesty find it?

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.400
What does the general think?

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.360
In my opinion,

00:02:45.719 --> 00:02:47.199
the tribute is fine enough,

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.199
but

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.319
the treasures of Nanjiang

00:02:50.919 --> 00:02:52.560
are far more than these items.

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.439
Exotic beasts
and rare curios are only trifles.

00:02:58.759 --> 00:03:00.479
Nanjiang's greatest treasure

00:03:00.919 --> 00:03:02.919
is its vast fertile land.

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:04.080
Your Highness,

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:06.039
what is your view?

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.639
That depends on your abilities, General.

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:14.800
If you can present such land to me,

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.900
then it would naturally be most welcome.

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:28.439
Your Highness,

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:31.000
I understand that you harbor resentment.

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.560
But what General Gan said earlier

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.100
was clearly a call to attack Nanjiang.

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:35.639
Once war begins,

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:37.199
there is no turning back.

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:38.919
For Your Highness,

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:41.479
what benefit does that bring?

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:42.719
Understand?

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:44.890
Li Yuanze, you think
you deserve to say that?

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:47.319
I want everyone to taste

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:49.159
the suffering I endured five years ago.

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:53.639
Besides,

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.120
if I can make Official Li uncomfortable,

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.520
why would I not do it?

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:09.599
(This scent...)

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:34.439
Official Li,

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:36.680
what is wrong?

00:04:39.959 --> 00:04:40.800
Your Highness,

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:42.839
I am fine.

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:50.839
Since His Majesty has already retired,

00:04:51.959 --> 00:04:53.199
I will take my leave for now.

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:21.439
Pingning,

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.439
why did you speak to him
like that just now?

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:27.360
You clearly did not mean it,

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:29.290
yet you insisted on
hurting him with your words.

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:31.439
Matters of adults

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:33.040
are not for children to meddle in.

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:35.439
Pingning,

00:05:35.759 --> 00:05:37.240
I am not a child anymore.

00:05:39.279 --> 00:05:40.319
If that is the case,

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:41.560
let me ask you.

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.160
Did you hear the deeper meaning
behind Gan Sheng's words?

00:05:44.399 --> 00:05:45.319
That is simple.

00:05:45.839 --> 00:05:47.279
Gan Sheng is ambitious and ruthless.

00:05:47.519 --> 00:05:50.079
He wants to invade Nanjiang
and expand our borders.

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:51.480
Once the two nations go to war,

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:52.879
military spending will rise.

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:53.920
His prestige

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:55.480
will naturally rise with it.

00:05:56.399 --> 00:05:57.319
By that time,

00:05:57.639 --> 00:05:59.279
he will reap all the benefits.

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:01.199
Gan Sheng is selfish and greedy.

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.920
But there is one thing
he was not wrong about.

00:06:03.959 --> 00:06:04.759
What is it?

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:08.790
A thousand miles of fertile land
and endless rivers and mountains.

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:10.199
Treasures like these

00:06:10.279 --> 00:06:12.480
would Your Majesty truly feel nothing?

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.519
How can a ruler be without ambition?

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:28.240
But I have no wish
to be another Emperor Wu of Han.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.190
I only wish to follow the ways
of Emperors Wen and Jing.

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:32.360
Why?

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:38.000
If war breaks out,

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:39.560
(Jing)
may indeed expand its borders.

00:06:39.639 --> 00:06:41.000
A great legacy may be achieved.

00:06:41.279 --> 00:06:42.000
But

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:43.680
the people will suffer for it.

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:44.879
It brings them no benefit.

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:46.759
A ruler's legacy

00:06:47.279 --> 00:06:49.639
lies not only in distant glories
but also in what is near.

00:06:49.839 --> 00:06:51.399
A brilliant line in the history books

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:53.480
cannot compare
to households filled with light.

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:02.860
(Princess Royal Yong'an's Residence)

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:10.920
If I can make Official Li uncomfortable,

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:14.160
why would I not do so?

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:27.370
This is a secret coagulation balm
from the Princess Royal's Residence.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.400
It uses sappanwood as medicine
and carries a unique scent.

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:32.759
Within the capital,

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.560
no one else knows the formula.

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:38.800
I used it only once,
on Mr. Qingya that day.

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:46.000
Why would he have any on him?

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:54.060
(Qingya and White Deer)

00:07:57.079 --> 00:07:59.439
(If you truly are him...)

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:12.480
General, a young servant in the residence
has been acting suspiciously.

00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:13.600
He left without permission.

00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:15.090
Should we bring him
back for questioning?

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:15.800
No need.

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:18.399
Let him go.

00:08:18.959 --> 00:08:19.879
Let us see

00:08:21.399 --> 00:08:23.120
which household this burrowing rat

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:27.560
belongs to.

00:08:28.519 --> 00:08:28.879
Yes.

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:38.039
(Could it be)

00:08:38.799 --> 00:08:40.360
(that she was testing my wound?)

00:08:43.679 --> 00:08:47.879
Sir, you seem rather unsettled today.

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:52.279
You see clearly, Master.

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:55.000
The Princess may already be suspicious.

00:08:55.679 --> 00:08:56.840
If one day

00:08:57.399 --> 00:09:00.240
she discovers
the identity of Mr. Qingya,

00:09:01.919 --> 00:09:03.759
I hope you will lend your aid.

00:09:04.519 --> 00:09:06.360
I have long said

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:09.200
that I am willing
to be of service to you.

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:19.480
Sir,

00:09:20.159 --> 00:09:22.320
do you recognize this?

00:09:28.879 --> 00:09:29.679
This is...

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:32.000
Open it and see.

00:09:36.399 --> 00:09:37.519
Windvine?

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:44.240
It grows in the Eastern Sea.

00:09:44.590 --> 00:09:45.879
When my mentor was still alive,

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:47.320
every so often

00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:49.330
he would ask traveling merchants
to search for it.

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:51.840
Zhao had asthma since childhood

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:54.519
and needed Windvine for her medicine,

00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:55.960
keeping it with her at all times.

00:09:58.840 --> 00:09:59.639
But now

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:02.639
she has no use for it anymore.

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:06.559
Some days ago,

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:08.519
Lotus Pavilion

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:10.960
received a large donation.

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:15.080
The only condition was that I

00:10:15.279 --> 00:10:16.559
find this

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:18.679
Windvine.

00:10:19.639 --> 00:10:20.440
Who was it?

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:24.639
The Princess Royal,

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:26.600
Xiao Pingning.

00:10:27.759 --> 00:10:29.000
Xiao Pingning?
