We are two sparrows,
adrift in life's dust.

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:07.220
At the orphanage, you stood up for me

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:09.620
and crashed right into my heart.

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.020

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.540

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.620
- then I searched for you for seven.

If someone must end this,

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.020
let it be me.

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.180
But before I die,

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.740
let me be your wife.

[To My Wife]

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:14.220
Qingyi,

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:16.260
my love,

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:17.740
I write this to you.

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:19.780
In this life,

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.540
we were fated to meet,

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.420
but not to be together.

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:24.980
More partings than meetings.

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.900
Take care.

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:29.420
I'm sorry.

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:33.820
Don't know how you felt

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:35.980
waiting for me.

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.540
I won't let you live with my ghost.

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.620
I made two promises to you in this life,

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:47.540
yet I broke them both.

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:49.820
If there's a next life,

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.580
I will make it up to you.

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:55.540
Though our names

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.180
are not engraved in the record,

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:59.380
not officially wed,

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:02.660
please forgive me

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:05.340
for calling you

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:08.380
my wife.

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.860
Qingyi.

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.220
Come on! We've been waiting for you.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:16.180
Such a fine young man!

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.460
Let me introduce! He's Chen Wenbin,

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:19.740
my son.

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:21.780
He will succeed me

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:23.220
in guarding Song City.

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:33.580
I cannot walk this path.

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:36.420
Not now,

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.020
not ever.

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:44.780
You killed my real father

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.780
right before me.

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:49.820
Tell me,

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:51.940
how should I face you

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:53.660
or myself?

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:59.220
Turn yourself in!

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:08.540
Wenbin,

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:12.220
never look at me like that.

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:16.260
I raised you.

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:20.140
I will always be your father.

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:30.420
Chen Shangfu is the source

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:32.620
of the opium evil!

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:34.380
Here is the proof!

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.300
Was it the Marshal?

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:40.940
He claimed to be

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:42.780
Song City's protector,

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:43.780
but he poisoned its people

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:46.020
with opium!

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:48.620
I'm here

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:50.940
to expose his crimes!

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:05.620
Wenbin.

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:12.260
You can't pull that trigger.

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:14.740
A father

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:17.180
knows his son.

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:30.180
Your blood doesn't run in my veins!

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:05.620
Now.

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:08.820
It does.

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:15.340
Take my life also

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:18.340
as your atonement.

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:23.540
Dad.

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:25.940
In this life

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:28.860
and the next,

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:32.420
let us not meet again.

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:25.420
Qingyi,

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:29.060
breaking my promise about marrying you

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:31.380
doesn't mean I don't love you.

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:35.300
My father, Chen Shangfu,

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:38.340
hurt too many.

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:41.860
This debt...

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:45.340
I must face it alone.

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:50.340
After this,

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:53.020
we will not meet again.

00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:57.020
May you

00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:00.420
release me from your heart

00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:04.180
and find true happiness.

00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:07.660
Be happy, safe, and free

00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:12.420
for the rest of your life.

00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:21.380
We fight side by side today.

00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:22.660
That makes us family.

00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:25.220
This tiger-head lock is our pledge.

00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:27.260
I will always protect you.

[To Sunlight, the Mute Golden Giver]

00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:57.660
Let's thank

00:08:57.780 --> 00:08:59.700
the anonymous donor, Sparrow.

00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:02.420
She donated this city block

00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:04.180
to the orphanage.

00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:06.580
From now on, this block

00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:08.660
will be the orphanage's property,

used to train
children's real-life skills.

00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:12.860
Now the children of Song City

00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:14.620
will have a true home here,
