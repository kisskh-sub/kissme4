00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:56.180
for a long time.

00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:00.060
He said Old Sir has been here
for a long time.

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:02.730
They treat him as one of their own
and live together.

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:04.490
Qu Zhen

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:07.340
learned ballet
because Old Sir told her about it.

00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:11.530
She said Qu Zhen learned ballet
because of Old Sir.

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:13.060
Well,

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:14.370
how old

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:16.530
is this Old Sir?

00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:19.220
How old is Old Sir?

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:21.340
Around sixty.

00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:24.700
Duoji.

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:28.060
Is this it?

00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:30.530
That's him.

00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:32.130
Yes.

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:33.100
Old Sir.

00:10:49.630 --> 00:10:51.530
Old Sir has been protecting

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:54.060
our Tibetan antelopes here.

00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:56.940
So he often goes into the mountains.

00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:59.010
He's gone for months at a time.

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:01.340
Since he's a volunteer,

00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:02.820
sometimes he runs short

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.180
on food and drink.

00:11:04.750 --> 00:11:06.220
Fortunately, when the weather is good,

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:07.890
the villagers will bring him

00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:09.650
some necessities.

00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:13.250
They are heroes in our eyes.

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:38.100
Ms. Tan, let's go.

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:39.650
Up ahead?

00:11:40.270 --> 00:11:40.730
Right over there.

00:11:49.270 --> 00:11:50.010
These fences

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:52.530
were all put up by Old Sir
and the others.

00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:53.490
It's really remote here.

00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:56.180
Sir.

00:12:00.270 --> 00:12:00.850
Sir.

00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:02.300
Are you home?

00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:04.850
Yes.

00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:06.580
Sir.

00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:28.530
Dad.

00:13:09.270 --> 00:13:09.460
Here.

00:13:10.390 --> 00:13:10.820
Have some apples.

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:14.130
Apples are rare

00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:15.770
around here.

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:17.250
These are

00:13:18.510 --> 00:13:19.370
what people usually

00:13:20.270 --> 00:13:21.010
bring for me.

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:23.730
Try some.

00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:25.300
Butter tea.

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:30.850
Here.

00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:32.300
Thank you, sir.

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:39.220
You can't have dairy.

00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:42.420
Have a sip of this.

00:13:43.150 --> 00:13:43.940
Plain tea is fine.

00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:46.940
Here.

00:13:54.390 --> 00:13:54.890
Careful, it's hot.

00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:02.180
Mr. Feng,

00:14:02.670 --> 00:14:03.850
I never expected

00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:05.580
we'd meet here.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:09.610
If

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:11.890
you hadn't come to help at our vineyard,

00:14:12.630 --> 00:14:14.220
Siting wouldn't have found you
so quickly.

00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:17.100
Yes.

00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:18.980
It's quite a coincidence.

00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:20.890
I was staying at a friend's place

00:14:20.910 --> 00:14:22.770
in the county town back then.

00:14:23.630 --> 00:14:25.490
I heard there was a mudslide
in your area

00:14:25.510 --> 00:14:26.530
and they needed volunteers,

00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:27.850
so I went over.

00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:29.730
It was fate.

00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:32.420
Have some tea.

00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:39.420
Are you alright?

00:14:50.630 --> 00:14:51.530
I'll have this.

00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:53.380
Okay.

00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:00.380
Alright.

00:16:00.580 --> 00:16:01.220
The utensils...

00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:02.340
The utensils are inside.

00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:02.900
I'll get them.

00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:03.980
Utensils.

00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:05.100
Okay.

00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:06.900
Anything else I can help with?

00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:07.740
No, no.

00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:08.500
Not needed.

00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:09.380
Don't bother.

00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:13.260
Today, Mr. Tan and his daughter
are reunited.

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:15.540
To welcome our guests from afar,

00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:18.860
and to thank Mr. Tan for his help,

00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:21.020
let's all have a toast.

00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:21.860
Come on.

00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:22.580
Thank you.

00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:24.980
Tashi Delek.

00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:25.820
Tashi Delek.

00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:34.700
Beef intestines.

00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:36.180
Thanks.

00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:38.860
This is a local specialty.

00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:39.420
Yes.

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:41.060
Sir, you have some too.

00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:42.300
Beef intestines.

00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:47.900
Thanks for the help
these past couple of days.

00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:48.700
Not at all.

00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:50.660
Sir.

00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:52.180
Stop drinking.

00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:52.620
Good work.

00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:52.900
Thank you.

00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:53.180
Just have a little.

00:16:53.780 --> 00:16:55.420
Drinking liquor on the plateau...

00:16:56.380 --> 00:16:57.180
Just a little, Dad.

00:16:57.580 --> 00:16:58.340
Then you should drink less.

00:16:58.700 --> 00:16:59.220
Easy on the drinks.

00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:00.940
Okay.

00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:10.220
Ting.

00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:12.380
Dad.

00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:16.620
Thank you.

00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:18.660
Are you cold?

00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:19.980
No, I'm not.

00:17:25.620 --> 00:17:26.620
The air here is so fresh.

00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:28.420
Yes.

00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:29.460
The air is good.

00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:31.660
Just a bit less oxygen.

00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:35.620
Most newcomers aren't used to it.

00:17:36.620 --> 00:17:37.140
Are you okay?

00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:38.500
I'm fine for now.

00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:43.140
You've changed a lot.

00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:45.260
Have I?

00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:48.660
You haven't changed.

00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:52.500
I've gotten old.

00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:53.540
I must have changed.

00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:56.620
Ting.

00:17:58.100 --> 00:17:59.100
You still haven't told me

00:17:59.340 --> 00:17:59.980
how you've been

00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:02.220
all these years.

00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:07.780
Dad,

00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:09.740
do you know

00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:12.340
why I never asked you that question?

00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:18.580
A person with no attachments,

00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:19.900
alone in a strange city,

00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:22.500
isolated

00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:24.260
and helpless.

00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:26.860
Aren't we

00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:28.820
the same?

00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:32.580
Ting,

00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:36.140
I'm sorry.

00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:37.900
Dad,

00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:39.220
don't say that.

00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:41.420
I understand.

00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:45.940
You can't understand.

00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:50.020
No one could understand
how I felt back then.

00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:53.180
And no one could help me.

00:18:55.820 --> 00:18:57.140
I was terrified.

00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:00.700
But I never expected

00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:01.540
Wei

00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:04.180
would end up like that.

00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:13.020
Dad.

00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:17.860
I didn't expect him to die.

00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:19.740
I didn't want him to die!

00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:20.900
I just wanted him to...

00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:23.100
I just wanted him
to face legal punishment.

00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:24.020
I...

00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:25.820
He fell by himself.

00:19:26.620 --> 00:19:27.540
Dad, don't say that.

00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:30.140
It had nothing to do with you.

00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:32.540
Gao Haotian's death
was what he deserved.

00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:35.860
Has Wei called back?

00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:37.340
No.

00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:40.980
Officer,

00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:42.340
I didn't push him!

00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:43.740
He fell by himself!

00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:44.860
Alright, tell me

00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:47.300
why you were at the scene that day.

00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:48.340
My master

00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:50.460
and I were working overtime.

00:19:51.820 --> 00:19:53.260
Then Gao Haotian showed up.

00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:54.820
He asked me
to deliver the documents to him.

00:19:55.900 --> 00:19:57.020
So I went to find him.

00:19:58.620 --> 00:20:00.620
Later, my master went too.

00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:02.340
As soon as

00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:04.180
I arrived at the parking lot,

00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:05.780
I saw Gao Haotian...

00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:10.420
Gao Haotian was chasing Tan Jun?

00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:12.500
Why?

00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:15.740
I don't know.

00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:17.180
What were you doing

00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:17.780
when Tan Jun came to find you?

00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:19.700
I was delivering documents to him.

00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:20.780
Delivering documents?

00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:22.460
Doing that

00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:23.500
took 20 minutes?

00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:26.020
Gao Haotian

00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:29.020
might be a bit unclear
about the documents.

00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:31.020
He asked me to explain.

00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:32.220
So I...

00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:35.940
If he didn't understand the documents
and needed an explanation,

00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:36.980
why didn't you explain it at the office

00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:38.020
instead of the parking lot?

00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:46.460
I don't know.

00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:48.700
I failed to consider her feelings.

00:20:49.620 --> 00:20:50.140
I don't know.

00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:51.660
I couldn't help her in time.

00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:53.300
So when I saw her die

00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:54.940
right in front of me,

00:20:55.820 --> 00:20:57.700
I was filled with guilt and pain.

00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:01.340
If I had thought things through
more carefully,

00:21:01.340 --> 00:21:03.940
Wei would have had a wonderful life.

00:21:03.980 --> 00:21:05.620
[In Memory
of My Beloved Daughter Shi Wei]

00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:08.340
Later, the situation escalated.

00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:11.060
Public opinion was all blaming me.

00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:11.580
It even

00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:13.900
started to involve you.

00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:15.340
[News Headlines]

00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:16.300
I

00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:18.700
was terrified.

00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:21.140
I felt like I was

00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:23.860
on the verge of a breakdown.

00:21:27.260 --> 00:21:28.220
To protect you,

00:21:29.740 --> 00:21:31.420
I had to make the decision

00:21:32.300 --> 00:21:32.820
to

00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:35.340
leave temporarily.

00:21:41.660 --> 00:21:43.820
But for a long time after that,

00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:47.340
I couldn't shake that fear.

00:21:49.580 --> 00:21:51.700
I woke up from nightmares
countless times.

00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:54.580
In those years,

00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:57.780
I could only sleep

00:21:58.660 --> 00:21:59.500
with sleeping pills.

00:22:09.860 --> 00:22:12.500
Later, I came here.

00:22:14.060 --> 00:22:15.380
I suddenly realized

00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:18.180
that this simple life

00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:19.460
was what I truly wanted.

00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:22.060
When I finally found the courage
to face you

00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:23.500
and this matter,

00:22:24.540 --> 00:22:25.580
I went back to look for you

00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:27.740
and asked everywhere about you.

00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:31.620
But you had already gone to France,

00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:33.460
without leaving any contact information.

00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:37.340
I regretted it so much.

00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:38.660
I regretted

00:22:38.660 --> 00:22:40.780
not going back to find you sooner.

Dad,

00:22:46.860 --> 00:22:47.620
don't say that.

00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:48.900
I knew

00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:51.060
we would meet again someday.

00:22:51.540 --> 00:22:52.740
I would definitely find you.

Yes.

00:25:11.740 --> 00:25:12.460
I've made my peace with it.

00:25:12.540 --> 00:25:13.140
I've made my peace.

00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:15.220

00:25:22.740 --> 00:25:23.620
Yes.

00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:25.260
Qu Zhen and I...

00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:25.660
Have one.

00:25:25.660 --> 00:25:26.420
...have a real connection.

00:25:27.780 --> 00:25:28.380
I remember

00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:30.060
when she was still little.

00:25:30.980 --> 00:25:32.460
She was herding cattle on the grassland.

00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:34.580
I was just wandering aimlessly

00:25:35.060 --> 00:25:35.940
across...

00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:39.460
the prairie.

00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:22.500
Where's my dad?

00:26:23.580 --> 00:26:23.980
You're up.

00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:24.580
He

00:26:25.060 --> 00:26:26.700
went out with Duoji to buy some things.

00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:27.460
He'll be back soon.

00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:29.860
Did you sleep well?

00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:33.700
I haven't slept as soundly
as I did last night

00:26:34.060 --> 00:26:35.020
in a very long time.

00:26:50.060 --> 00:26:50.740
What are you thinking about?

00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:53.460
I'm thinking

00:26:54.820 --> 00:26:56.620
about how much courage it takes
for someone

00:26:59.140 --> 00:27:00.780
to come to a completely new environment

00:27:01.820 --> 00:27:02.860
and start a whole new life.

00:27:08.740 --> 00:27:09.740
I'm talking about my dad.

00:27:12.860 --> 00:27:13.820
He came here alone.

00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:16.100
He needed time

00:27:17.540 --> 00:27:18.540
to adjust to this environment.

00:27:20.260 --> 00:27:21.780
It's really not easy to persevere.

00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:26.860
If

00:27:28.540 --> 00:27:30.220
he had discussed it with someone,

00:27:30.540 --> 00:27:31.740
the outcome might have been different.

00:27:56.140 --> 00:27:57.740
Are you getting used to the food here?

00:27:59.260 --> 00:28:00.060
It's not like in the city.

00:28:00.740 --> 00:28:02.100
There are no veggies

00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:03.020
and rice here.

00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:05.740
We have butter tea

00:28:06.340 --> 00:28:07.060
and beef jerky every day.

00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:09.860
And of course,
the most important thing is this.

00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:11.500
Tsampa.

00:28:12.460 --> 00:28:13.340
Do you know how to make it?

00:28:14.020 --> 00:28:15.060
Let me show you.

00:28:15.940 --> 00:28:16.700
After mixing it,

00:28:16.900 --> 00:28:17.660
just do it slowly,

00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:19.380
like kneading dough.

00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:21.900
Do you have

00:28:22.660 --> 00:28:23.380
these ingredients?

00:28:23.660 --> 00:28:24.620
That's called...

00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:25.220
That...

00:28:25.220 --> 00:28:26.020
Quark.

00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:26.580
Yes.

00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:26.820
Right.

00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:27.580
Butter.

00:28:27.620 --> 00:28:28.780
That's really chewy.

00:28:28.780 --> 00:28:31.140
If you like it sweet,
you can add a little sugar.

00:28:32.300 --> 00:28:32.900
Mr. Tan.

00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:34.900
If you don't speak now...

00:28:35.460 --> 00:28:37.500
I feel like communicating with him
in Tibetan.

00:28:38.540 --> 00:28:40.380
You really can't tell he's actually Han.

00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:40.860
Really.

00:28:42.100 --> 00:28:42.780
This is

00:28:43.420 --> 00:28:44.460
what they call environment
shaping a person.

00:28:45.340 --> 00:28:46.900
I've been here for so many years.

00:28:47.340 --> 00:28:48.740
I've long since adapted
to the local customs.

00:28:52.620 --> 00:28:53.620
No matter how good Tibetan food is,

00:28:54.460 --> 00:28:56.100
what I miss the most is...

00:28:56.540 --> 00:28:56.780
Dad,

00:28:58.980 --> 00:29:00.860
the fish head and tofu soup
you used to make for me.

00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:04.660
People here

00:29:04.780 --> 00:29:05.500
don't eat fish.

00:29:06.940 --> 00:29:08.140
Next time you visit,

00:29:09.700 --> 00:29:11.340
I'll prepare it for you in advance.

00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:16.220
Eat up.

00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:16.940
Have some more.

00:29:17.260 --> 00:29:17.620
Duoji,

00:29:17.900 --> 00:29:18.540
get them some tea.

00:29:18.980 --> 00:29:19.380
Alright.

00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:22.660
Here you go, sir.

00:29:23.540 --> 00:29:24.020

Ms. Gao.

Ms. Gao.

00:29:39.220 --> 00:29:40.100
Brew me some coffee

00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:40.860
and bring it to the meeting room.

00:29:42.660 --> 00:29:43.020
Ms. Gao.

Ms. Gao.

00:29:46.860 --> 00:29:48.060
The board meeting at 2 PM.

00:29:49.100 --> 00:29:50.020
You notified me.

00:29:50.980 --> 00:29:51.460
Ms. Gao,

00:29:51.980 --> 00:29:53.820
the board meeting was last Thursday.

00:29:54.140 --> 00:29:55.140
You chaired it yourself.

00:29:58.420 --> 00:29:59.860
Ms. Gao, you've been too busy lately.

00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:03.420
Then bring me

00:30:03.740 --> 00:30:04.740
last month's reports.

00:30:05.460 --> 00:30:06.100
Yes, Ms. Gao.

00:30:06.580 --> 00:30:07.140
I'll still

00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:08.540
bring you the coffee then.

00:30:11.580 --> 00:30:12.340
Over the summer,

00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:14.260
Mr. Chen's violin class is pretty full.

00:30:14.820 --> 00:30:16.060
So we're considering

00:30:16.060 --> 00:30:17.820
opening one more class.

00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:19.260
I think that's fine.

00:30:19.660 --> 00:30:21.140
Mr. Chen, we appreciate your hard work.

00:30:21.540 --> 00:30:21.900
It's what I should do.

00:30:22.300 --> 00:30:23.500
Summer is the peak season.

00:30:23.740 --> 00:30:24.620
We must not slack off.

00:30:25.020 --> 00:30:25.860
Thank you all for your hard work.

00:30:26.900 --> 00:30:27.940
Get back to work now.

00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:28.340
Okay.

00:30:28.540 --> 00:30:29.060
We'll leave you to it.

00:30:29.180 --> 00:30:29.460
Madam.

00:30:30.540 --> 00:30:31.140
Ms. Wen.

00:30:31.660 --> 00:30:32.700
Are you feeling better?

00:30:32.940 --> 00:30:33.540
Much better.

00:30:35.060 --> 00:30:36.780
I heard you've been
working overtime a lot lately.

00:30:37.220 --> 00:30:38.140
Working hard is good.

00:30:38.580 --> 00:30:39.900
But you must take care of your health.

00:30:41.100 --> 00:30:41.700
Thank you.

00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:44.860
I came to ask

00:30:44.860 --> 00:30:46.100
if we could

00:30:46.820 --> 00:30:47.700
postpone

00:30:48.420 --> 00:30:49.300
the concert.

00:30:50.020 --> 00:30:52.060
But weren't you well prepared?

00:30:53.140 --> 00:30:54.940
Maybe there's just been
too much going on lately.

00:30:55.620 --> 00:30:57.020
I feel a bit run down.

00:30:58.580 --> 00:30:59.980
Are you pregnant?

00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:02.700
No.

00:31:03.940 --> 00:31:05.180
Is it because of the wedding plans?

00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:09.060
It's due to some personal reasons.

00:31:10.340 --> 00:31:11.740
It's fine if you don't want to
talk about it.

00:31:12.020 --> 00:31:13.020
I'll talk to them about it.

00:31:14.180 --> 00:31:14.540
Alright?

00:31:15.020 --> 00:31:15.780
Thank you.

00:31:16.580 --> 00:31:17.540
I'm really sorry.

00:31:19.020 --> 00:31:19.380
It's fine.

00:31:19.820 --> 00:31:20.580
Don't worry about it.

00:31:28.460 --> 00:31:28.980
Thank you.

00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:32.460
Mr. Feng,

00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:34.860
I should be the one thanking you.

00:31:35.820 --> 00:31:37.460
You brought Ting all the way here,

00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:39.380
so we could finally meet.

00:31:40.340 --> 00:31:41.900
Just call me Rui.

00:31:42.940 --> 00:31:43.500
Rui.

00:31:46.100 --> 00:31:47.700
Actually, I saw you

00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:48.620
at the vineyard before.

00:31:49.820 --> 00:31:51.140
I just didn't say hello.

00:31:53.940 --> 00:31:54.340
I understand.

00:31:56.100 --> 00:31:57.500
That situation

00:31:58.180 --> 00:31:58.700
must still be

00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:00.980
a painful memory for you.

00:32:03.660 --> 00:32:04.700
Thanks for your understanding.

00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:10.220
Sir,

00:32:11.260 --> 00:32:13.340
what are your plans now?

00:32:16.620 --> 00:32:18.980
I think I'll stay here.

00:32:20.380 --> 00:32:21.860
After all, I'm used to everything here

00:32:21.860 --> 00:32:23.140
by now.

00:32:23.940 --> 00:32:24.860
But Siting...

00:32:27.060 --> 00:32:28.180
I feel she really wants you

00:32:30.060 --> 00:32:31.380
to go back with her.

00:32:34.340 --> 00:32:34.980
I know.

00:32:37.060 --> 00:32:38.060
Ting

00:32:38.540 --> 00:32:39.420
has her career.

00:32:40.460 --> 00:32:41.460
She's busy.

00:32:42.140 --> 00:32:44.260
I'm afraid I'll be a burden on her.

00:32:45.340 --> 00:32:46.020
Now that she's come here

00:32:46.020 --> 00:32:47.660
and seen that I'm doing fine,

00:32:47.660 --> 00:32:49.180
she won't worry about me

00:32:49.940 --> 00:32:50.820
like she used to.

00:32:51.220 --> 00:32:51.500
Yes.

00:32:54.580 --> 00:32:55.500
Ms. Gao...

00:32:57.060 --> 00:32:58.300
How has your mom been lately?

00:32:59.540 --> 00:33:00.020
She

00:33:01.660 --> 00:33:02.500
is the same as always.

00:33:04.860 --> 00:33:05.860
Does she know about Ting?

00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:10.500
Ting

00:33:11.940 --> 00:33:14.780
has been sensible since she was little.

00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:17.140
I'd like her

00:33:18.220 --> 00:33:19.500
to start a family soon.

00:33:20.660 --> 00:33:22.660
I really hope there's someone

00:33:23.220 --> 00:33:24.580
who'll love her unconditionally.

00:33:26.740 --> 00:33:27.860
Ting

00:33:28.980 --> 00:33:30.500
really deserves to be loved.

00:33:39.540 --> 00:33:39.900
Peiyan,

00:33:40.580 --> 00:33:41.300
are you very busy?

00:33:41.980 --> 00:33:43.900
My schedule has been quite full lately.

00:33:45.100 --> 00:33:45.780
Alright.

00:33:46.260 --> 00:33:47.020
But no matter how full your schedule is,

00:33:47.140 --> 00:33:48.060
you must eat on time.

00:33:48.900 --> 00:33:49.300
Understood?

00:33:49.820 --> 00:33:50.620
I know.

00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:51.980
[Music Room]

00:33:51.980 --> 00:33:52.580
Is Rui

00:33:53.460 --> 00:33:54.340
very busy lately too?

00:33:56.860 --> 00:33:57.140
Yes.

00:33:58.540 --> 00:33:59.060
He

00:33:59.700 --> 00:34:00.500
has been quite busy lately as well.

00:34:00.900 --> 00:34:01.580
Being busy is good.

00:34:03.220 --> 00:34:03.540
Peiyan,

00:34:04.780 --> 00:34:06.140
I ran into an old colleague

00:34:07.060 --> 00:34:07.900
from our school's academic office

00:34:07.900 --> 00:34:09.260
while grocery shopping.

00:34:10.380 --> 00:34:11.100
His daughter

00:34:11.420 --> 00:34:12.620
is also getting married
in the second half of the year.

00:34:13.700 --> 00:34:14.700
Said it's really hard to book a hotel.

00:34:16.060 --> 00:34:16.860
You and Rui

00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:17.900
should hurry up and book one.

00:34:18.700 --> 00:34:20.020
Let us know once you've booked it,

00:34:21.020 --> 00:34:22.100
so we can make some preparations.

00:34:22.580 --> 00:34:22.940
Dad.

00:34:24.460 --> 00:34:25.300
We broke up.

00:34:26.780 --> 00:34:27.540
I'm not getting married.

00:34:31.420 --> 00:34:31.820
Okay.

00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:34.380
I see.

00:34:34.900 --> 00:34:35.500
Don't worry.

00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:37.940
I'll handle it for you.

00:34:38.420 --> 00:34:39.220
Come home this weekend.

00:34:40.380 --> 00:34:41.940
I haven't cooked in a long time.

00:34:44.860 --> 00:34:45.860
With your cooking skills?

00:34:45.860 --> 00:34:47.220
You only know how to make noodles.

00:34:48.020 --> 00:34:49.060
Let Mom do it.

00:34:51.020 --> 00:34:52.340
My zhajiangmian

00:34:52.540 --> 00:34:53.540
is pretty amazing, okay?

00:34:54.940 --> 00:34:57.660
I'll add the crunchy nuts you love.

00:34:59.220 --> 00:34:59.900
Remember?

00:35:00.700 --> 00:35:01.340
When you were little,

00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:02.700
if you didn't do well on a test

00:35:03.540 --> 00:35:05.940
or didn't get first place
in a piano competition,

00:35:07.220 --> 00:35:07.900
you'd come home

00:35:08.140 --> 00:35:08.940
demanding

00:35:09.420 --> 00:35:10.460
my noodles.

00:35:11.820 --> 00:35:12.900
I'm not bragging.

00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:15.780
With a bowl of my noodles,

00:35:16.580 --> 00:35:16.940
you

00:35:17.020 --> 00:35:18.020
could face anything with a smile.

00:35:18.380 --> 00:35:19.420
And everything will be okay.

00:35:25.940 --> 00:35:26.660
Okay. I got it.

00:35:27.980 --> 00:35:28.620
I'm hanging up.

00:36:50.580 --> 00:36:52.140
Actually, there's one thing

00:36:52.900 --> 00:36:54.100
I'm concerned about.

00:36:55.340 --> 00:36:56.100
Well,

00:36:57.540 --> 00:36:59.580
you can't keep living alone.

00:36:59.740 --> 00:37:01.060
It's so lonely.

00:37:02.420 --> 00:37:03.540
Wouldn't it be nice

00:37:03.820 --> 00:37:05.540
to start a happy, warm family soon?

00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:10.140
I think Feng Rui is great.

00:37:11.860 --> 00:37:12.140
Dad,

00:37:13.140 --> 00:37:15.180
it's not like that
between Feng Rui and me.

00:37:18.540 --> 00:37:18.700
But

00:37:19.300 --> 00:37:19.700
he

00:37:20.340 --> 00:37:21.700
came all this way with you...

00:37:23.180 --> 00:37:25.100
Maybe he just feels guilty

00:37:26.140 --> 00:37:26.820
and wants to help me.

00:37:29.980 --> 00:37:31.860
A lot has happened over the years.

00:37:33.540 --> 00:37:34.580
Let's not talk about it.
It's all in the past.

00:37:35.020 --> 00:37:36.140
Everything is fine now.

00:37:39.980 --> 00:37:42.020
You can't force feelings,

00:37:43.300 --> 00:37:43.780
but

00:37:45.140 --> 00:37:45.940
I'd advise you

00:37:47.140 --> 00:37:47.740
not to be

00:37:48.260 --> 00:37:49.340
too willful sometimes.

00:37:58.140 --> 00:37:58.500
Dad.

00:37:58.860 --> 00:37:59.260
I'm fine.

00:38:00.140 --> 00:38:00.500
It's okay.

00:38:00.900 --> 00:38:01.180
Dad,

00:38:01.820 --> 00:38:03.020
let me take you to see a doctor.

00:38:03.020 --> 00:38:03.940
It's fine. Look,

00:38:05.060 --> 00:38:06.580
beyond those mountains,

00:38:07.580 --> 00:38:08.180
that

00:38:08.620 --> 00:38:09.460
whole area

00:38:10.300 --> 00:38:11.460
is uninhabited.

00:38:12.660 --> 00:38:15.340
That's where
the Tibetan antelopes often roam.

00:38:16.500 --> 00:38:17.180
I just thought,

00:38:18.340 --> 00:38:20.780
if my daughter knew I was here

00:38:21.180 --> 00:38:23.060
doing meaningful work like this,

00:38:24.700 --> 00:38:25.340
maybe

00:38:26.340 --> 00:38:28.660
she could forgive me
for leaving without a word.

00:38:32.220 --> 00:38:34.060
When you suddenly left,

00:38:35.580 --> 00:38:36.700
I was completely lost.

00:38:38.380 --> 00:38:39.700
I looked for you everywhere
but couldn't find you.

00:38:41.660 --> 00:38:42.980
I was so scared,

00:38:45.140 --> 00:38:46.900
and even a little resentful.

00:38:49.140 --> 00:38:51.020
But later, I realized

00:38:52.620 --> 00:38:53.700
that whenever I missed you,

00:38:55.100 --> 00:38:56.700
the memories that came to mind

00:38:57.060 --> 00:38:58.340
were all happy

00:38:59.500 --> 00:39:00.300
and beautiful ones.

00:39:00.300 --> 00:39:01.580
You celebrating my birthday every year.

00:39:03.020 --> 00:39:04.780
You cooking my favorite meals every day,

00:39:05.620 --> 00:39:06.740
waiting for me to come home from school.

00:39:07.940 --> 00:39:08.940
You riding your bike

00:39:10.260 --> 00:39:12.020
to take me to Ms. Zhuang's
for dance lessons.

00:39:17.860 --> 00:39:18.460
So

00:39:19.860 --> 00:39:20.500
I feel

00:39:21.060 --> 00:39:22.420
I've already received so much.

00:39:23.900 --> 00:39:25.140
Gradually, I figured it out.

00:39:26.460 --> 00:39:28.060
If you can find a place

00:39:28.860 --> 00:39:30.740
where you can live comfortably...

00:39:34.460 --> 00:39:35.380
As long as you're happy,

00:39:36.060 --> 00:39:36.780
I'm at peace.

00:39:40.460 --> 00:39:42.060
My only wish is for you

00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:45.620
to be happy.

00:39:47.620 --> 00:39:48.620
Forever happy.

00:39:52.140 --> 00:39:52.660
Dad,

00:39:54.980 --> 00:39:56.340
I only have one wish now.

00:39:57.980 --> 00:39:58.900
Can you promise me?

00:39:59.740 --> 00:40:00.060
Yes.

00:40:00.980 --> 00:40:01.260
Tell me.

00:40:03.420 --> 00:40:04.460
Don't move away again.

00:40:06.220 --> 00:40:06.980
That way,

00:40:07.860 --> 00:40:08.940
I can come visit you every year.

00:40:31.620 --> 00:40:33.220
Take good care of your health.

00:40:33.420 --> 00:40:34.020
Don't worry.

00:40:34.740 --> 00:40:35.340
Don't worry.

00:40:36.780 --> 00:40:37.380
I have to go.

00:40:46.420 --> 00:40:46.780
I'm leaving.

00:40:47.460 --> 00:40:48.020
Go on.

00:40:50.340 --> 00:40:50.740
Sir.

00:40:51.180 --> 00:40:51.780
Thank you,

00:40:52.020 --> 00:40:52.540
Rui.

00:40:52.540 --> 00:40:52.940
Take care.

00:40:54.260 --> 00:40:54.700
We're leaving.

00:40:54.820 --> 00:40:55.660
Alright.

00:41:31.700 --> 00:41:32.140
Come in.

00:41:34.740 --> 00:41:35.820
You haven't left yet, Hui.

00:41:36.780 --> 00:41:37.300
What is it?

00:41:41.060 --> 00:41:41.500
Hui,

00:41:42.060 --> 00:41:42.860
let me tell you,

00:41:43.380 --> 00:41:46.780
only you can carry off this outfit
with such class.

00:41:48.580 --> 00:41:50.260
Who would believe you're fifty

00:41:50.660 --> 00:41:51.540
if you told them?

00:41:52.220 --> 00:41:52.900
Alright,

00:41:53.420 --> 00:41:54.740
what trouble have you gotten into now?

00:41:55.460 --> 00:41:56.900
What trouble could I possibly be in?

00:41:57.380 --> 00:41:58.620
Can't I just come see you?

00:42:00.100 --> 00:42:02.380
There aren't many things
that get you up this early.

00:42:04.340 --> 00:42:05.180
Short on money?

00:42:06.700 --> 00:42:09.900
Nothing escapes your sharp eyes.

00:42:11.660 --> 00:42:13.460
I went to Macao, China,
a couple of days ago.

00:42:13.700 --> 00:42:16.300
The Finance Department
hasn't approved the travel expenses yet.

00:42:16.940 --> 00:42:17.860
If this keeps up,

00:42:17.860 --> 00:42:19.660
I'll be broke.

00:42:19.980 --> 00:42:21.060
Can you bear to see that?

00:42:23.180 --> 00:42:23.780
Haotian,

00:42:24.780 --> 00:42:25.980
you promised me

00:42:25.980 --> 00:42:26.740
you'd stop gambling.

00:42:27.740 --> 00:42:29.100
If you do it again,
even I won't be able to

00:42:29.460 --> 00:42:30.380
cover for you in front of Dad.

00:42:30.660 --> 00:42:31.380
I promise

00:42:32.260 --> 00:42:33.140
I won't gamble anymore.

00:42:35.060 --> 00:42:36.380
What am I going to do with you?

00:42:37.820 --> 00:42:38.420
So about the money...?

00:42:40.420 --> 00:42:41.420
Fine.

00:42:41.740 --> 00:42:43.540
I'll go hurry them up right now.

00:42:46.460 --> 00:42:47.780
Dad's birthday is in a few days.

00:42:47.780 --> 00:42:48.940
Did you get a gift?

00:42:49.460 --> 00:42:50.660
I'm not going.

00:42:51.020 --> 00:42:52.500
It won't matter if my gift is missing.

00:42:53.420 --> 00:42:54.340
Stop the nonsense.

00:42:55.140 --> 00:42:55.700
Be there on time.

00:42:56.300 --> 00:42:56.740
Yes, ma'am.

00:42:57.500 --> 00:42:57.820
Get out.

00:43:01.060 --> 00:43:01.540
Hui,

00:43:02.540 --> 00:43:04.780
you've been licking your lips a lot.

00:43:05.140 --> 00:43:07.060
The weather's dry.
Take care of yourself.

00:43:08.500 --> 00:43:09.860
Here's your favorite mint flavor.

00:43:16.620 --> 00:43:17.580
