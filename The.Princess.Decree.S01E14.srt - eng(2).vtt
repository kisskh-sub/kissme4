00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:31.359
Senior.

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.199
The general has moved
all the troops away.

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:10.100
Is he not afraid
the Princess will escape?

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.860
When a disobedient little creature
refuses to listen,

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.680
you must first let it taste hope,

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:16.800
then drag it back.

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:18.319
Do that a few times,

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.319
and it will learn obedience.

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:23.080
Do not worry, General. Leave it to me.

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:45.719
Hyah.

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.400
Hyah.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:49.520
Hyah.

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:00.319
Your Highness,

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:02.800
you will not get away.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.800
Why not

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:06.919
come back with me and
admit your mistake to the general?

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:25.439
Your Highness.

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:28.639
Why is it you?

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:31.319
I was

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.960
simply passing by.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:36.620
Are you hurt, Your Highness?

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:40.159
I am fine.

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.360
Those horses just now,

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.560
was that your doing?

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.800
Most of the horses in the camp are bred
from Beijiang warhorses.

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:51.840
These horses are extremely sensitive
to the scent of iron-saddle grass.

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:54.080
I merely used a small trick

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:55.560
to draw them away.

00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:58.840
You seem remarkably familiar

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.800
with matters of Beijiang.

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:06.840
I simply have concerns
that tie my heart there.

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:17.720
Enough.

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:20.319
We should leave this place quickly
and go somewhere safe.

00:04:24.439 --> 00:04:25.240
Your Highness.

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:33.519
Forgive my offense.

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:13.160
Gan Sheng's men went toward
the capital to search.

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:16.240
At this moment, we have circled around
to the rear of the camp,

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:17.360
which is even safer.

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.160
Perhaps

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:20.639
we should rest here for a while.

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:25.720
Mr. Qingya, you truly
have influence everywhere.

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:26.959
Even the guards of my residence

00:05:26.959 --> 00:05:28.879
did not realize
I had gone missing at once,

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:31.000
yet you managed to appear
in time to save me.

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:32.519
Could it be

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.079
that you had someone watching me?

00:05:36.319 --> 00:05:37.560
It was only coincidence.

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.120
Your Highness may have forgotten.

00:05:40.839 --> 00:05:43.800
Lotus Pavilion is on the only road leading
to the outer military camp.

00:05:44.439 --> 00:05:45.560
If someone passes by my place

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:46.839
and I know nothing of it,

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:48.360
then Mr. Qingya

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:50.319
would hardly deserve his reputation.

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:52.199
But why is it that you,

00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:54.040
almost as if foreseeing it,

00:05:54.439 --> 00:05:55.480
knew I was in danger?

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:05.100
Your Highness does not
like military camps, do you?

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:06.360
The stories of Beijiang

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:08.240
were all told to me by Your Highness.

00:06:08.439 --> 00:06:09.560
Yet after only a few days,

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:11.630
Your Highness has already forgotten?

00:06:14.879 --> 00:06:17.120
The way you speak with such certainty

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:19.519
reminds me of someone I once knew.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.600
He too was spirited and proud,

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:24.199
and would show a bit of flair at times.

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:25.519
Only

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:29.480
he is no longer the same now.

00:06:40.519 --> 00:06:42.040
And what is he like now?

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:48.720
In the court,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
there is always an impeachment memorial.

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:53.680
Even common folk, when enraged,
can stir bloodshed across the land!

00:06:53.879 --> 00:06:55.000
Let alone people like us!

00:07:01.079 --> 00:07:02.730
Perhaps his heart
has turned cold as iron,

00:07:03.319 --> 00:07:04.399
ruthless and decisive.

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:06.560
Or perhaps

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:08.990
he is still the gentle young man
he once was.

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:13.720
Truth be told,
I can no longer see through him.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.880
Since you have met
many people in your travels,

00:07:17.279 --> 00:07:18.720
could you not analyze it for me?

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:29.800
You should rest first, sir.

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:32.040
Since you saved me twice,

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:34.279
I will repay you properly.

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:15.439
I say repay,

00:08:15.439 --> 00:08:16.639
but my means are limited.

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:18.759
So I must trouble you to make do.

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:26.920
Simple fare,
yet better than rare delicacies.

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:29.480
In plays and stories,
the wandering immortals

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:30.600
always say as much.

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:33.480
As the saying goes, to steal a half day
of leisure from life.

00:08:33.919 --> 00:08:34.799
The simpler it is,

00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:37.000
the more precious it becomes.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:39.919
In that case,

00:08:40.039 --> 00:08:40.919
thanks to you,

00:08:40.919 --> 00:08:43.080
I have had
half a day of an immortal's life.

00:08:49.639 --> 00:08:50.759
Wild greens from the mountain

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:52.260
are best for cooling the body.

00:08:52.679 --> 00:08:53.120
Try some.

00:09:13.679 --> 00:09:14.480
(It is mugwort.)

00:09:15.279 --> 00:09:16.279
(She did it on purpose.)

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:18.799
What is it?

00:09:19.159 --> 00:09:20.480
Is it not to your taste?

00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:33.320
The flavor is indeed unusual.

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:35.840
I simply wonder, Your Highness,

00:09:36.639 --> 00:09:38.559
what special ingredient you added to it.

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:00.559
Could it be

00:10:00.559 --> 00:10:02.720
there is something you cannot eat?

00:10:17.919 --> 00:10:19.919
It really is exactly the same.

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:22.279
An allergy.

00:10:23.279 --> 00:10:25.240
Yet you knew today
was the Spring Outing Banquet.

00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:27.000
The green dumplings
always contain mugwort.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.190
And you still insisted on eating them.

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:33.480
What is this?

00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:36.120
Licorice.

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:38.480
It can ease the reaction.

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:43.720
Here.

00:10:46.759 --> 00:10:48.720
Since you carry licorice
on you at all times,

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:49.720
it seems

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:51.320
that even when your body suffers,

00:10:52.519 --> 00:10:54.320
you refuse to let others
see your weakness.

00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:00.080
Now that I know,

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:02.159
does that mean
I can control you at will?

00:11:05.279 --> 00:11:06.480
I believe Your Highness

00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:10.679
would never endanger
someone's life in that way.

00:11:15.559 --> 00:11:17.120
So you will keep my secret.

00:11:17.759 --> 00:11:18.559
Won't you?

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:22.720
I will never let a third person know.
