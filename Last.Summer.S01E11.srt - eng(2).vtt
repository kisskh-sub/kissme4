You need a variety of drawings

00:00:40.895 --> 00:00:42.605
to design a house.

00:00:43.773 --> 00:00:45.275
From the elevation to the section,

00:00:46.317 --> 00:00:47.902
from the section to the perspective,

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.113
and from the perspective to models.

00:00:52.323 --> 00:00:53.157
Song Ha-gyeong.

00:00:54.576 --> 00:00:55.827
Just wait for me in summer.

00:00:56.953 --> 00:00:59.873
"Summer" is in both our names.

00:00:59.956 --> 00:01:01.499
That's so childish.

00:01:03.835 --> 00:01:06.254
Fine. Whatever.

00:01:06.337 --> 00:01:09.465
For summer,
I'll make you my number one.

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:10.884
Happy?

00:01:14.137 --> 00:01:15.346
The face I knew.

00:01:16.556 --> 00:01:18.558
The elevation drawing during the 21 days

00:01:19.601 --> 00:01:21.102
had you, who hated summer,

00:01:22.228 --> 00:01:24.314
and me, who loved summer.

00:01:24.397 --> 00:01:27.317
I want to try getting through
that unbearable summer with you.

00:01:28.026 --> 00:01:29.444
The face I never knew.

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:31.571
The section drawing of the 52 days

00:01:33.072 --> 00:01:36.868
had you and me,
facing the summer together.

00:01:38.411 --> 00:01:40.371
The unfamiliar face that no one saw.

00:01:42.498 --> 00:01:44.042
That perspective in winter

00:01:45.835 --> 00:01:47.670
had you and me, together as us.

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:11.319
What will the model we build together…

00:02:12.779 --> 00:02:14.072
…look like?

00:02:31.047 --> 00:02:31.923
Did you sleep well?

00:02:32.006 --> 00:02:33.758
Did your side look like this?

00:02:35.093 --> 00:02:36.344
Why does it look different?

00:02:36.427 --> 00:02:39.472
Maybe because we went over
another mountain together?

00:02:39.555 --> 00:02:42.976
-You were talking in your sleep.
-That can't be right.

00:02:43.768 --> 00:02:45.645
For real,
I could hear it through the wall.

00:02:46.354 --> 00:02:47.188
Really?

00:02:48.398 --> 00:02:49.315
What did I say?

00:02:50.108 --> 00:02:53.695
You said you liked me,
that you missed me, that you loved me,

00:02:53.778 --> 00:02:55.196
and I shouldn't go anywhere.

00:02:56.698 --> 00:02:59.617
That wasn't sleep-talking.
I've wanted to say that.

00:03:01.911 --> 00:03:04.080
Look at you. What's up with you?

00:03:04.163 --> 00:03:05.373
I'm always like this.

00:03:07.875 --> 00:03:11.337
You're amazing in winter.
I'm curious about the other seasons.

00:03:13.715 --> 00:03:15.591
Why are you dressed up? Going somewhere?

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:19.637
Since I'm really back,
I need to keep my last promise.

00:03:19.721 --> 00:03:22.098
Last promise? What is that?

00:03:27.437 --> 00:03:31.399
The Cheontan-myeon mural street
I promised during my reelection campaign

00:03:31.941 --> 00:03:33.443
is steadily coming along.

00:03:33.985 --> 00:03:36.404
This project breathes new life
into a space,

00:03:36.487 --> 00:03:39.324
-bringing culture and art together--
-Isn't it unfair?

00:03:39.407 --> 00:03:40.700
What?

00:03:41.451 --> 00:03:44.037
Unfair? What's he saying?
What is he talking about?

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:49.417
There are other projects
that need your attention.

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.794
There's a proper order for everything.

00:03:51.878 --> 00:03:54.213
I'll look into everything, in order.

00:03:54.297 --> 00:03:56.507
In terms of order, this should come first.

00:03:57.425 --> 00:03:58.885
It's like being the lesser child.

00:04:01.971 --> 00:04:04.390
There's a camera around.
Let's talk privately.

00:04:05.516 --> 00:04:07.101
It's not just up to me.

00:04:09.395 --> 00:04:11.606
Is it the pushback
from the solar business?

00:04:13.524 --> 00:04:16.527
For matters like this,
you need to go through the right channels,

00:04:16.611 --> 00:04:18.071
and make an official complaint.

00:04:18.154 --> 00:04:20.948
We need a personal touch
rather than an official one,

00:04:21.032 --> 00:04:23.368
to handle both
complaints and public opinions.

00:04:24.827 --> 00:04:26.829
Yes, if that's something for Patan.

00:04:28.706 --> 00:04:30.375
I'll see you soon.

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:36.964
Where did he disappear to all day?

00:04:44.764 --> 00:04:45.890
JOURNALIST KIM GYEONG-MIN

PROTEST OVER PATAN OBSERVATORY CONTINUES

SUHYEON-RI PUBLIC PROJECT
HALTS AFTER ONE MONTH

00:05:00.446 --> 00:05:02.824
TRESPASSING TO OBSERVATORY

SOLAR PROJECT ADVOCATES
S.P.A.

00:05:15.753 --> 00:05:17.130
S.P.A. CHATROOM
31 PARTICIPANTS

00:05:17.213 --> 00:05:18.339
Renews spotlight? As if.

00:05:18.423 --> 00:05:21.092
We went through so much
filing all those complaints.

00:05:21.175 --> 00:05:22.427
Still, it paid off.

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:25.721
With all the complaints,
the construction was shut down.

00:05:25.805 --> 00:05:29.392
Now we need to get the mayor
firmly on our side,

00:05:29.475 --> 00:05:31.352
but he's still wishy-washy.

00:05:31.436 --> 00:05:34.939
I heard the observatory architect
had returned.

00:05:35.606 --> 00:05:38.025
What if he pushes for construction again?

00:05:38.609 --> 00:05:40.653
We should come up with a plan.

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:42.947
How about a get-together?

00:05:52.623 --> 00:05:56.878
We should keep a low profile.
Drawing attention will just cause trouble.

00:05:56.961 --> 00:05:58.212
STEPPING STONE LEFT THE CHAT

00:05:58.296 --> 00:05:59.630
NO OBSERVATORY LEFT THE CHAT

00:06:01.591 --> 00:06:03.134
This isn't easy.

00:06:03.217 --> 00:06:07.513
Excuse me. Could you check on
what I requested for last time?

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:12.602
He's really sneaky.

00:06:12.685 --> 00:06:16.647
He used to be a regular,
but I never knew who he was.

00:06:16.731 --> 00:06:18.482
Been a while since he came.

00:06:24.405 --> 00:06:25.239
You scared me.

00:06:25.781 --> 00:06:27.867
-You're home?
-Yes.

00:06:28.743 --> 00:06:32.163
Hey. What's all this?

00:06:35.249 --> 00:06:37.835
We need to restart
the observatory project.

00:06:37.919 --> 00:06:41.589
You're after the one who's sabotaging
our construction with nasty complaints?

00:06:42.924 --> 00:06:44.383
But it won't be easy.

00:06:44.467 --> 00:06:46.302
So I got my backup line running.

00:06:48.554 --> 00:06:49.889
Right on time for the meeting.

00:06:50.932 --> 00:06:52.391
Join us, Ms. Song.

00:06:53.517 --> 00:06:55.311
What? What are you doing?

00:06:57.688 --> 00:06:59.398
Hey, Dr. Song.

00:07:00.107 --> 00:07:02.985
-You made it.
-Village heads.

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:06.656
Master Baek, we did this often
when you were in the States.

00:07:06.739 --> 00:07:08.366
It continues here in Patan.

00:07:08.449 --> 00:07:10.451
Our PT star summit.

00:07:13.746 --> 00:07:14.830
Okay, gentlemen.

00:07:14.914 --> 00:07:16.582
Let's start the briefing.

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:23.923
Just like you said,
the source feeding stories to the reporter

00:07:24.632 --> 00:07:26.551
was someone from our village.

00:07:26.634 --> 00:07:28.886
I checked through my sources,

00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:31.013
and apparently, a lot of people

00:07:31.097 --> 00:07:33.641
took out private loans
to invest in the solar project.

00:07:34.809 --> 00:07:36.102
They're probably fixated

00:07:36.185 --> 00:07:39.355
on the money they'll make
once the solar project gets approved.

00:07:39.814 --> 00:07:43.234
The observatory and solar project
can't coexist in the same area.

00:07:43.317 --> 00:07:46.988
They interfere with each other,
investors won't stay quiet about it.

00:07:47.071 --> 00:07:49.282
Take a look at this.

00:07:50.241 --> 00:07:53.869
It's the person who crashed
the City Hall server.

00:07:53.953 --> 00:07:55.288
It's the same IP address used

00:07:55.371 --> 00:07:57.456
for complaints
from the anti-observatory group.

00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:01.294
I went to the Internet café
that the IP trace pointed to.

00:08:01.377 --> 00:08:02.795
He never turned up.

00:08:02.878 --> 00:08:05.214
-What?
-We talked in the chat, though.

00:08:05.298 --> 00:08:07.675
Our team has started
the performance today.

00:08:08.718 --> 00:08:10.845
Are they building the observatory again?

00:08:10.928 --> 00:08:13.055
CONSTRUCTION PAUSED

00:08:13.139 --> 00:08:15.391
Looks like
they'll resume the construction.

00:08:15.474 --> 00:08:17.685
Yes. From today.

00:08:17.768 --> 00:08:19.270
From today?

00:08:21.022 --> 00:08:23.065
We've started taking action too.

00:08:23.149 --> 00:08:26.193
Looks like the observatory construction
will start.

00:08:26.277 --> 00:08:27.111
Really?

00:08:27.194 --> 00:08:29.905
It's been pretty noisy around the school.

00:08:30.823 --> 00:08:32.867
-I thought it was already over.
-What?

00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:34.785
I saw the building the other day.

00:08:34.869 --> 00:08:39.040
It looked ready to open. It was spotless.

00:08:39.123 --> 00:08:40.374
Is that so?

00:08:40.458 --> 00:08:41.709
Sure enough.

00:08:41.792 --> 00:08:44.378
You really sped up the preparations.

00:08:45.212 --> 00:08:48.883
Then, gentlemen.
The operation begins tomorrow, right?

00:08:48.966 --> 00:08:50.635
-Yes.
-See you tomorrow.

00:08:51.844 --> 00:08:54.555
-With Ms. Song too.
-Let's do this, Ms. Song.

00:08:54.639 --> 00:08:55.806
-Way to go.
-Okay.

00:09:01.562 --> 00:09:02.813
Everything all right?

00:09:05.608 --> 00:09:08.194
This is Mr. Jo.

00:09:08.778 --> 00:09:09.737
All clear here.

00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:11.572
CLOTHES DONATION BIN

00:09:11.656 --> 00:09:13.699
This is Jeon. Jeon, all clear.

00:09:13.783 --> 00:09:15.368
Hwangtae, clear.

00:09:16.619 --> 00:09:17.453
Gorani, all clear.

00:09:24.377 --> 00:09:25.795
All clear here too.

00:09:28.964 --> 00:09:31.717
This is Dr. Song, Master Baek. Clear.

00:09:33.552 --> 00:09:34.720
You think they'll show up?

00:09:34.804 --> 00:09:37.682
They've been waiting
for the final approval.

00:09:37.765 --> 00:09:40.101
Tomorrow's the big day.

00:09:41.519 --> 00:09:42.728
Then the day before,

00:09:42.812 --> 00:09:46.691
the rival project resumed.
They'll come to check.

00:09:54.281 --> 00:09:56.450
Crow.

00:09:56.534 --> 00:09:58.411
A suspicious crow passed by.

00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:15.010
UNDER CONSTRUCTION
DO NOT ENTER

00:10:22.351 --> 00:10:23.269
See that?

00:10:23.352 --> 00:10:26.063
They're ready to resume.
Convince the investors…

00:10:27.022 --> 00:10:28.524
You won't even do that?

00:10:28.607 --> 00:10:30.693
I've given you all those leads.

00:10:35.781 --> 00:10:37.616
Crow spotted me. Charge forward!

00:10:40.661 --> 00:10:42.121
Charge forward!

00:10:42.204 --> 00:10:43.831
Oh, no. What do I do? Stop.

00:10:44.832 --> 00:10:46.000
He's running away.

00:10:49.211 --> 00:10:50.212
Are you okay?

00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:06.896
Get him!

00:11:06.979 --> 00:11:08.314
Get him!

00:11:10.399 --> 00:11:12.902
He's the one! Get him!

00:11:34.089 --> 00:11:35.424
Got you.

00:11:35.508 --> 00:11:37.259
I knew this day would come.

00:11:37.343 --> 00:11:39.887
I kept up my running in Patan.

00:11:39.970 --> 00:11:41.514
Pavengers, situation's over.

00:11:42.389 --> 00:11:43.474
Don't you dare.

00:11:46.352 --> 00:11:47.311
You're Stepping Stone?

00:11:51.315 --> 00:11:52.733
Patan!

00:11:52.816 --> 00:11:53.651
Patan!

00:11:55.069 --> 00:11:55.986
Cheers!

00:12:10.042 --> 00:12:12.670
It's been a while. Did you miss me?

00:12:12.753 --> 00:12:13.963
What are you doing here?

00:12:14.046 --> 00:12:17.466
I said we should catch up,
"Stepping Stone."

00:12:21.095 --> 00:12:23.097
After getting cut from the public project,

00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:26.809
you thought the solar project would
help you become the next county chief?

00:12:26.892 --> 00:12:28.852
Is that why your username is
"Stepping Stone?"

00:12:28.936 --> 00:12:30.104
Unbelievable.

00:12:30.646 --> 00:12:31.689
Don't worry. Eat.

00:12:32.731 --> 00:12:36.110
There's a lot of money invested.
You're first place…

00:12:37.069 --> 00:12:37.945
and he's second.

00:12:46.954 --> 00:12:47.788
Who are you?

00:12:48.581 --> 00:12:49.582
"Who are you?"

00:12:51.083 --> 00:12:53.168
-"Who are you?"
-Wait.

00:12:53.252 --> 00:12:55.671
Not the stomach.
It really hurt back then.

00:12:55.754 --> 00:12:58.799
Why would I hit you?
Get your punishment elsewhere.

00:13:01.594 --> 00:13:03.554
You jerk, you're still wearing that watch.

00:13:07.516 --> 00:13:08.559
So?

00:13:08.642 --> 00:13:12.313
The gambling debt kept increasing.

00:13:13.564 --> 00:13:16.400
The solar project's the only way
to settle the debt.

00:13:16.483 --> 00:13:17.401
He told me so.

00:13:18.569 --> 00:13:19.528
What are you saying?

00:13:19.612 --> 00:13:23.741
I just shared the information
that there was an option.

00:13:23.824 --> 00:13:26.619
Detective, he's the one who hurt Ms. Song.

00:13:29.163 --> 00:13:31.332
You told me to do that!

00:13:31.415 --> 00:13:33.542
-Me?
-Yes.

00:13:42.051 --> 00:13:42.968
STOP THE REMODELING

00:13:43.052 --> 00:13:44.637
I saw the building a few days ago.

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:48.432
It looked ready to open. It was spotless.

00:13:52.645 --> 00:13:57.149
I just told you to stir the pot.
I didn't tell you to actually hurt her.

00:13:57.232 --> 00:14:00.319
Unbelievable.
I did what you told me to.

00:14:00.402 --> 00:14:02.571
Hey, you can't lie here.

00:14:02.655 --> 00:14:05.449
He's hiding the truth.
He can't get away with it.

00:14:05.532 --> 00:14:09.328
Chang-joo, I'm not hiding the truth.
You really can't do this to me!

00:14:09.411 --> 00:14:10.496
POLICE FOR THE PEOPLE

00:14:10.579 --> 00:14:14.583
Those who pushed the solar project
are still Pacheon residents.

00:14:15.292 --> 00:14:16.627
I feel bad about it.

00:14:18.253 --> 00:14:20.714
We've developed plans
for those individuals.

00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:22.466
Ms. Song?

00:14:23.842 --> 00:14:24.802
Yes.

00:14:24.885 --> 00:14:27.346
We need more people
to manage the observatory

00:14:27.429 --> 00:14:28.889
and improve the surrounding area.

00:14:28.973 --> 00:14:31.517
This could provide
long-term job opportunities

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:33.102
for those who've suffered losses.

00:14:34.269 --> 00:14:37.815
It's been my goal
to make it a space for everyone,

00:14:39.233 --> 00:14:40.401
not just a select few.

00:14:41.694 --> 00:14:43.696
I believe the observatory

00:14:44.196 --> 00:14:46.198
could help the local economy

00:14:47.032 --> 00:14:48.951
and become Pacheon's next landmark.

00:14:51.370 --> 00:14:54.540
You two will show the stars to me

00:14:54.623 --> 00:14:56.542
and the people in the community.

00:14:58.002 --> 00:14:58.919
I look forward to it.

00:14:59.003 --> 00:15:01.422
-Thanks for your support.
-Thank you.

00:15:03.298 --> 00:15:04.216
Take care.

00:15:07.219 --> 00:15:09.847
Yes! Hey, that was awesome.

00:15:11.932 --> 00:15:13.642
I'm genuinely impressed.

00:15:13.726 --> 00:15:16.103
Baek Do-ha in winter
is rough and wild. Just my type.

00:15:16.186 --> 00:15:18.647
And Song Ha-gyeong in winter
is hot and cold,

00:15:18.731 --> 00:15:20.524
switching back and forth.
Totally my type.

00:15:21.191 --> 00:15:23.986
There are many sides to my personality
you don't know yet.

00:15:27.865 --> 00:15:31.618
Let's stay close and see it all,
the good and the bad.

00:15:34.038 --> 00:15:37.708
By the way,
we've been kind of flirty everywhere.

00:15:37.791 --> 00:15:38.834
Let's be careful.

00:15:44.256 --> 00:15:45.299
Promise me.

00:15:45.382 --> 00:15:48.594
Once the construction's back on,
let's separate work and personal life.

00:15:48.677 --> 00:15:51.430
Of course.
Don't bring personal life to work,

00:15:51.513 --> 00:15:53.557
and don't bring work to our personal life.

00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:54.767
Sure thing.

00:15:55.601 --> 00:15:57.770
Let's keep it separated, like this space.

00:16:01.315 --> 00:16:02.149
Hey.

00:16:03.692 --> 00:16:05.486
What do we do about this?

00:16:06.612 --> 00:16:08.989
August 31st. What will you do about this?

00:16:11.533 --> 00:16:14.536
A contract's a contract.

00:16:15.412 --> 00:16:17.790
What? The year is missing here.

00:16:18.999 --> 00:16:20.709
Double-check it next time, Dr. Song.

00:16:21.752 --> 00:16:22.628
Are you kidding me?

00:16:22.711 --> 00:16:24.254
Then you really want me to leave?

00:16:24.338 --> 00:16:26.757
-Are you kidding me?
-Exactly.

00:16:34.723 --> 00:16:37.893
I don't think
we need contracts like this anymore.

00:16:47.778 --> 00:16:49.530
Patan-myeon needs to step up their game.

00:16:51.073 --> 00:16:54.535
Everything's so fresh. Just like you.

00:17:02.626 --> 00:17:03.460
So good.

00:17:05.879 --> 00:17:08.507
Here. This place's nice.

00:17:08.590 --> 00:17:10.509
No need to compromise, no arguments.

00:17:18.308 --> 00:17:20.352
We've been getting along
without fighting.

00:17:20.435 --> 00:17:22.229
I guess it really is winter, right?

00:17:22.312 --> 00:17:24.148
How about a date after this?

00:17:24.231 --> 00:17:26.316
Sounds good. How about a movie?

00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:27.442
Or a café?

00:17:27.526 --> 00:17:30.904
Or Seoul?
Should I kidnap you to the south coast?

00:17:30.988 --> 00:17:32.698
-That sounds good.
-Right?

00:17:33.991 --> 00:17:34.825
One second.

00:17:39.163 --> 00:17:40.664
-Hey, Jong-shin.
-Hello, Ms. Kim.

00:17:42.166 --> 00:17:44.835
One month is enough.
Keep the restart schedule as it is.

00:17:45.669 --> 00:17:46.503
Thanks.

00:17:48.630 --> 00:17:50.299
-Wait, a month?
-Wait, ten days?

00:17:52.092 --> 00:17:53.468
That's crazy. Absolutely not.

00:17:53.552 --> 00:17:54.928
No way. Absolutely not.

00:17:56.263 --> 00:17:57.764
-Later, bye.
-Talk to you later.

00:17:59.933 --> 00:18:02.603
-Hey, Song Ha-gyeong.
-You said "hey," Director Baek?

00:18:03.145 --> 00:18:05.355
Draw the line between
work and personal life.

00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:09.902
I didn't know this was work, Ms. Song.

00:18:12.946 --> 00:18:14.406
Adjust the schedule in ten days.

00:18:14.489 --> 00:18:19.161
The main reason this project got held up
was Pluto, wasn't it, Director Baek?

00:18:19.244 --> 00:18:21.079
I think City Hall shares the blame

00:18:21.163 --> 00:18:23.999
for not stopping the protest
and complaints, Ms. Song.

00:18:25.918 --> 00:18:29.546
It's a public project.
I'm sure you know we have a set budget.

00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:33.467
I made five design changes with
Sangdong City Hall on public projects.

00:18:34.468 --> 00:18:36.136
That's exactly why I'm here.

00:18:37.346 --> 00:18:41.642
And it's been annoying me.
Please call me "Supervisor."

00:18:41.725 --> 00:18:43.101
Right.

00:18:43.185 --> 00:18:45.604
-Supervisor Song.
-That's right.

00:18:45.687 --> 00:18:47.814
You're known as a mad dog about rules.

00:18:47.898 --> 00:18:49.566
-Once you bite down--
-I don't let go.

00:18:50.108 --> 00:18:52.861
So, do you want to get bitten?

00:18:58.325 --> 00:18:59.868
Shall we take a break?

00:19:11.505 --> 00:19:14.258
You can't play your cards like this,
Director Baek.

00:19:14.341 --> 00:19:18.887
"Play my cards," Supervisor Song?
I meant to explore each other, privately.

00:19:20.430 --> 00:19:22.557
Studying during my break
isn't really my thing.

00:19:23.725 --> 00:19:25.018
But I'm intrigued.

00:19:25.894 --> 00:19:29.564
Our break is almost over.
We should speed things up.

00:19:33.777 --> 00:19:36.238
Director Baek. Ms. Song?

00:19:39.741 --> 00:19:41.702
The food is here. Where'd they go?

00:19:41.785 --> 00:19:45.205
We don't need to make
the hidden walls streamlined.

00:19:45.289 --> 00:19:47.082
This will make it sturdier

00:19:47.165 --> 00:19:49.710
and cost less to maintain,
Supervisor Song!

00:19:50.794 --> 00:19:52.170
It all sounds nice,

00:19:52.254 --> 00:19:54.715
but we might end up going over budget
to cut costs.

00:19:54.798 --> 00:19:56.300
That's nonsense again.

00:19:56.383 --> 00:19:59.344
Let's go to my office.
I'll show you the model.

00:20:00.429 --> 00:20:01.722
-Fine, let's go.
-What?

00:20:01.805 --> 00:20:03.515
-I'll go see it.
-Where are you going?

00:20:08.770 --> 00:20:11.815
Now you see how important it is?

00:20:11.898 --> 00:20:13.025
What's all this touching?

00:20:14.568 --> 00:20:17.571
I told you not to bring
personal matters to work.

00:20:22.951 --> 00:20:26.538
This is my office, okay?
It's a personal space.

00:20:41.011 --> 00:20:44.097
Seriously! How many times
do I have to tell you?

00:20:44.181 --> 00:20:46.308
I said this won't work, Director Baek!

00:20:48.810 --> 00:20:52.147
Are you okay? She seems really upset--

00:20:52.230 --> 00:20:53.565
There's blood on your lip.

00:20:54.149 --> 00:20:55.317
-Blood?
-Yes.

00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:59.529
This? It's winter, it's just chapped.

00:21:01.907 --> 00:21:02.824
Don't be dramatic.

00:21:02.908 --> 00:21:04.743
-Ms. Song.
-Yes?

00:21:04.826 --> 00:21:06.787
What if this leaves a scar?

00:21:07.037 --> 00:21:09.956
Director Baek. It won't.

00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:14.711
Then… If we pick up where we left off…

00:21:16.004 --> 00:21:16.880
it might help.

00:21:30.143 --> 00:21:33.188
Hey, put me down! Seriously, hey!

00:21:37.275 --> 00:21:38.110
What was that?

00:21:39.694 --> 00:21:40.529
Oh, no.

00:21:41.738 --> 00:21:42.614
Are you okay?

00:21:51.665 --> 00:21:53.083
What do we do?

00:21:53.166 --> 00:21:54.334
Tell me about it.

00:21:55.460 --> 00:21:57.838
You put me on a roller coaster ride.

00:21:57.921 --> 00:22:00.215
Ms. Song. I mean, Song Ha-gyeong.

00:22:01.383 --> 00:22:04.970
Let's stop fighting, please?
Life's too short not to love each other.

00:22:05.053 --> 00:22:06.471
Stop being stubborn.

00:22:07.222 --> 00:22:09.057
I'm not being stubborn. I'm being sincere.

00:22:09.141 --> 00:22:12.686
We have to check the dome joints
and finish the initial landscaping.

00:22:12.769 --> 00:22:14.563
You saw the files I sent you earlier.

00:22:15.105 --> 00:22:19.943
I saw the updated perspective.
We do need to check the dome.

00:22:21.069 --> 00:22:22.946
You never know until you check inside.

00:22:23.530 --> 00:22:27.617
I really want to
keep this last promise the right way,

00:22:28.702 --> 00:22:30.036
so we can make a new promise.

00:22:31.163 --> 00:22:32.164
What's the new promise?

00:22:39.379 --> 00:22:40.922
Anything you can imagine.

00:22:43.967 --> 00:22:45.093
I give you my word.

00:22:45.177 --> 00:22:47.888
I'll do my best
to support you, Director Baek.

00:22:49.890 --> 00:22:51.016
Supervisor Song…

00:22:51.850 --> 00:22:53.393
I won't let you down.

00:22:56.354 --> 00:22:58.773
-Let's do this!
-Let's do this!

00:23:03.945 --> 00:23:08.450
To build a building,
you should keep many promises.

00:23:09.743 --> 00:23:11.828
All the connections are good, right?

00:23:11.912 --> 00:23:14.164
A promise
between the client and the architect,

00:23:14.247 --> 00:23:16.499
between the weather and the date,

00:23:16.583 --> 00:23:18.293
and between the meters and the numbers.

00:23:18.376 --> 00:23:20.587
How long does it take for the dome
to open fully?

00:23:30.013 --> 00:23:32.807
DENEB
WELCOME TO THE DENEB ROOM

00:23:34.476 --> 00:23:36.394
2. NO VISITORS WITHOUT APPROVAL
3. BE KIND

00:23:36.478 --> 00:23:38.813
SUMMER TRIANGLE

00:23:41.024 --> 00:23:42.817
A promise not to change.

00:23:45.070 --> 00:23:46.154
By the way,

00:23:46.238 --> 00:23:48.782
do the stars seem extra special
from the dome?

00:23:49.991 --> 00:23:51.785
You don't just look at the stars.

00:23:52.869 --> 00:23:54.496
You get to feel the sky.

00:23:54.579 --> 00:23:56.623
We couldn't see anything
because of the weather.

00:23:56.706 --> 00:23:59.584
-But we'll see them for sure later.
-We'll see them for sure later.

00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:03.713
I'm tired of hearing that.

00:24:04.506 --> 00:24:07.092
-I copied it without thinking.
-Did I say it too much?

00:24:14.182 --> 00:24:17.227
I don't think the stars
will be easy to see from here.

00:24:19.104 --> 00:24:21.815
Actually, I'll make it
the right way later.

00:24:23.275 --> 00:24:25.235
Okay, that's a promise.

00:24:25.318 --> 00:24:28.613
Design by Baek Do-young,
architecture by Baek Do-ha,

00:24:28.697 --> 00:24:30.573
supervision by Song Ha-gyeong.

00:24:30.657 --> 00:24:33.785
-The three of us are making it together.
-Okay.

00:24:35.745 --> 00:24:36.579
Let's put it in.

00:24:40.375 --> 00:24:42.002
A promise to share our hearts.

00:24:52.929 --> 00:24:55.640
ALTAIR, DENEB, VEGA

00:24:55.724 --> 00:25:00.020
PATAN HIGH OBSERVATORY
RENOVATION PROJECT

00:25:03.231 --> 00:25:07.485
A promise to show
the best version of ourselves.

00:25:13.116 --> 00:25:16.661
That was really grueling.
Patan Observatory.

00:25:16.745 --> 00:25:20.290
Why? It kept us together
through those grueling times.

00:25:21.458 --> 00:25:23.918
Who says the observatory
brought us together?

00:25:25.045 --> 00:25:28.256
-It was me.
-I think I played a bigger part in it.

00:25:29.424 --> 00:25:33.219
If I hadn't mentioned August 31st,
would you have even seen me?

00:25:33.303 --> 00:25:36.639
You would've had to have insisted,
if you wanted to see me.

00:25:37.432 --> 00:25:39.184
We came this far through thick and thin.

00:25:39.267 --> 00:25:41.061
Seriously though,

00:25:41.853 --> 00:25:45.315
if I hadn't kept my promise and left,
what would you have done?

00:25:47.317 --> 00:25:49.110
I mean, just hypothetically.

00:25:49.694 --> 00:25:52.864
I'd track you down and give you hell.

00:25:52.947 --> 00:25:55.325
Don't you dare take it literally
and leave.

00:25:55.909 --> 00:25:59.579
Even so, I'd go around the globe
and find my way back to you.

00:26:00.705 --> 00:26:01.831
Of course you should.

00:26:03.041 --> 00:26:04.751
I'm not letting go. I can't!

00:26:06.878 --> 00:26:08.630
Gross! Disgusting!

00:26:09.881 --> 00:26:10.715
You're here?

00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:13.468
Okay, look at the camera.

00:26:18.264 --> 00:26:19.307
Take a good picture!

00:26:19.391 --> 00:26:22.519
Okay, one, two, three.

00:26:24.854 --> 00:26:26.773
-Did it turn out okay?
-Let's see.

00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:28.900
Did it turn out well?

00:26:28.983 --> 00:26:30.318
Yes, it looks good.

00:26:31.444 --> 00:26:33.321
-Let me see.
-It looks good.

00:26:34.155 --> 00:26:36.616
After over a decade,
how come nothing's changed?

00:26:36.699 --> 00:26:38.368
Something's changed.

00:26:39.369 --> 00:26:40.370
Do-young is gone.

00:26:42.455 --> 00:26:43.998
Things between us have changed.

00:26:44.082 --> 00:26:45.875
How does it feel, now that it's finished?

00:26:49.504 --> 00:26:50.338
I like it.

00:26:51.089 --> 00:26:55.427
It's designed to connect with people
who want to see the stars.

00:26:56.761 --> 00:26:57.929
What about you, Ha-gyeong?

00:27:00.765 --> 00:27:02.809
We have an observatory in our town

00:27:02.892 --> 00:27:05.061
where we get
the best view of the Summer Triangle.

00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:07.105
That's all that matters.

00:27:08.314 --> 00:27:09.774
Your goal for ten years from now.

00:27:09.858 --> 00:27:11.192
After ten years?

00:27:11.943 --> 00:27:14.237
I'll retire from the national team
with no regrets,

00:27:14.779 --> 00:27:16.614
and become a coach for the national team.

00:27:16.698 --> 00:27:18.825
I'll be the wife
of the national team coach.

00:27:20.869 --> 00:27:24.205
I'll graduate from med school and join
the international medical community.

00:27:24.998 --> 00:27:28.001
I'll travel around the world
and study the stars.

00:27:30.962 --> 00:27:31.796
Well…

00:27:32.797 --> 00:27:34.007
I'll build an observatory.

00:27:34.841 --> 00:27:38.553
Although not all of our summer promises
came true…

00:27:41.097 --> 00:27:44.476
and a lot changed over the winter.

00:27:45.310 --> 00:27:46.436
-What?
-Hey, you saw that?

00:27:46.519 --> 00:27:47.604
Was it a shooting star?

00:27:47.687 --> 00:27:49.189
We have to make a wish.

00:27:49.272 --> 00:27:50.482
Make a wish.

00:27:51.399 --> 00:27:52.901
Like the stars that connect us,

00:27:54.694 --> 00:27:56.237
the heart of our promises

00:27:57.655 --> 00:27:58.490
is still

00:27:59.699 --> 00:28:02.702
shining brightly.

00:28:06.206 --> 00:28:08.082
Do-ha left this just as it was.

00:28:09.042 --> 00:28:09.876
Remember?

00:28:10.793 --> 00:28:12.837
We hopped over the fence
to see the stars.

00:28:14.047 --> 00:28:15.256
That was really fun.

00:28:16.508 --> 00:28:18.593
I found the courage to confess to you.

00:28:19.552 --> 00:28:20.970
Let's go now. It's getting late.

00:28:21.554 --> 00:28:24.474
Seung-taek.
You know what I wished for earlier?

00:28:26.518 --> 00:28:27.936
That we could be friends.

00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:31.481
Let's stay friends.

00:28:32.899 --> 00:28:36.110
We don't need to destroy, erase everything
like it never happened.

00:28:36.194 --> 00:28:37.403
It's 12 years of our lives.

00:28:39.364 --> 00:28:40.698
Don't be ridiculous.

00:28:41.991 --> 00:28:43.618
How can we be friends?

00:28:43.701 --> 00:28:45.954
Why not? Being friends is the easiest.

00:28:46.538 --> 00:28:48.498
Compared to secretly having a crush,

00:28:48.581 --> 00:28:50.834
or being an athlete's girlfriend
for 12 years,

00:28:51.334 --> 00:28:52.335
it should be easier.

00:28:53.169 --> 00:28:55.505
We'll keep running
into each other like this,

00:28:55.588 --> 00:28:57.757
and we can't be awkward
every single time.

00:28:58.591 --> 00:28:59.425
Also…

00:29:01.928 --> 00:29:03.930
without each other in those 12 years,

00:29:04.764 --> 00:29:06.057
there's barely anything left.

00:29:14.649 --> 00:29:16.359
Do you want to make one last bet?

00:29:18.069 --> 00:29:20.029
To see if we can really be friends?

00:29:33.001 --> 00:29:36.504
How about dinner to celebrate
the completion?

00:29:40.717 --> 00:29:42.385
MESSAGE RECEIVED FROM "NUMBER ONE"

00:29:42.969 --> 00:29:44.888
At 7:30 p.m., at Star Lounge.

00:29:46.848 --> 00:29:49.809
Remember that suit you wore
when we went head-to-head at your office?

00:29:49.893 --> 00:29:52.145
Wear that. Look sexy.

00:30:15.293 --> 00:30:16.502
Please have a seat.

00:30:23.343 --> 00:30:24.218
Hold on.

00:30:36.189 --> 00:30:38.608
Figures my taste wasn't wrong.

00:30:39.442 --> 00:30:40.902
I can't take my eyes off you.

00:30:40.985 --> 00:30:42.070
Right back at you.

00:30:42.862 --> 00:30:44.822
It feels like my vision's getting better.

00:30:50.620 --> 00:30:51.454
Right.

00:30:53.289 --> 00:30:55.667
Making a memory out of this moment
would be perfect.

00:31:14.477 --> 00:31:15.937
A gift for finishing the project.

00:31:17.313 --> 00:31:18.314
To celebrate

00:31:18.398 --> 00:31:21.567
that we made our way back to each other
across a 14-hour time difference.

00:31:22.819 --> 00:31:23.695
Give me your hand.

00:31:40.545 --> 00:31:41.754
And…

00:31:48.845 --> 00:31:49.721
What is this now?

00:32:02.650 --> 00:32:03.818
AUTO TRANSFER - BAEK DO-HA

00:32:05.778 --> 00:32:08.281
Ha-gyeong, stop seducing me.

00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:10.074
No, wait.

00:32:10.158 --> 00:32:13.036
Are you already tired of me?
Is this like "take this and get lost"?

00:32:13.119 --> 00:32:14.996
It's for taking care of Su-bak.

00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:18.291
I've saved up everything you've sent.

00:32:20.126 --> 00:32:22.336
That could cover several round trips
to the States.

00:32:25.423 --> 00:32:27.258
You should go to the States.

00:32:31.429 --> 00:32:32.346
What do you mean?

00:32:33.473 --> 00:32:36.350
The Hermann project.
Go work on that.

00:32:37.518 --> 00:32:40.063
Come on, I just got here.
Why are you telling me to go?

00:32:40.146 --> 00:32:41.939
I know you wanted to do that.

00:32:42.732 --> 00:32:44.901
You were up all night
watching it yesterday.

00:32:55.578 --> 00:32:58.206
Just let architect Baek Do-ha
do what he really wants

00:32:59.123 --> 00:33:00.083
from now on.

00:33:01.209 --> 00:33:03.419
With no guilt, obligation,

00:33:04.420 --> 00:33:05.630
or pressure.

00:33:07.423 --> 00:33:10.176
This time, I won't drill through walls,

00:33:10.968 --> 00:33:12.720
and you don't need to leave notes.

00:33:12.804 --> 00:33:14.347
I'll wait for you anyway.

00:33:15.848 --> 00:33:17.892
Consider that watch
my little chain on you.

00:33:20.561 --> 00:33:22.355
Ha-gyeong, you're unbelievable.

00:33:23.940 --> 00:33:25.274
So, Mr. Baek…

00:33:26.317 --> 00:33:29.570
feels like tonight could be

00:33:30.988 --> 00:33:32.657
our last night.

00:33:34.492 --> 00:33:36.202
We're not going home tonight.

00:33:37.745 --> 00:33:38.746
We're going upstairs.

00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:46.879
Once we finish this.

00:33:48.965 --> 00:33:49.841
Let's eat.

00:33:50.633 --> 00:33:52.176
-Let's eat fast.
-Okay.

00:33:57.265 --> 00:33:58.558
-Is it good?
-Yes.

00:34:07.191 --> 00:34:08.025
What?

00:34:11.070 --> 00:34:11.988
Are you okay?

00:34:17.618 --> 00:34:20.663
You didn't check if the food had peanuts?

00:34:21.497 --> 00:34:23.249
How could I leave you?

00:34:23.332 --> 00:34:26.127
It's my first time in 17 years.

00:34:26.878 --> 00:34:30.423
-Take me back there.
-No, we're going to the hospital.

00:34:32.216 --> 00:34:35.553
I barely managed to book
the Grand Royal Palace Hotel.

00:34:35.636 --> 00:34:38.598
That's almost my entire month's salary.

00:34:39.515 --> 00:34:40.558
Hey.

00:34:40.641 --> 00:34:41.934
Let me just stay one night.

00:34:42.018 --> 00:34:42.894
No.

00:34:48.941 --> 00:34:49.901
Stop following me.

00:34:49.984 --> 00:34:51.736
Go to your room.

00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:54.071
I don't want you seeing me like this.

00:34:55.865 --> 00:34:56.908
Hey.

00:34:59.577 --> 00:35:01.996
Gosh, why do you have to be this cute?

00:35:03.372 --> 00:35:07.043
No, I'm not. I'm going for an elegant
and sophisticated look today.

00:35:08.753 --> 00:35:11.714
I'm the cool lady sending off
her boyfriend today.

00:35:11.797 --> 00:35:14.300
So let's just say goodbye here, all right?

00:35:18.346 --> 00:35:19.680
Seriously.

00:35:30.566 --> 00:35:31.400
Hey.

00:35:33.736 --> 00:35:34.570
Ha-gyeong.

00:35:35.488 --> 00:35:36.656
Don't be too cute.

00:35:38.115 --> 00:35:40.660
I wish I'd known this side of you sooner.

00:35:40.743 --> 00:35:41.744
Hey.

00:35:42.745 --> 00:35:44.288
Forget seeing me like this.

00:35:44.372 --> 00:35:46.832
So what if you look like this?
You're just lovely.

00:35:54.674 --> 00:35:56.801
Wait for me
till the end of the Hermann project?

00:35:56.884 --> 00:35:58.302
I can't say how long it'll take.

00:35:58.386 --> 00:35:59.595
Are you serious?

00:36:00.429 --> 00:36:03.891
I waited 344 days just for 21 days.

00:36:04.433 --> 00:36:05.768
I'll visit you, if I miss you.

00:36:05.851 --> 00:36:08.479
I'll probably check in first
because I'll want to see you.

00:36:10.648 --> 00:36:13.943
I don't think
I have enough time off for that.

00:36:16.904 --> 00:36:18.406
What if someone

00:36:19.657 --> 00:36:21.450
snatches this cutie while I'm away?

00:36:22.034 --> 00:36:24.954
Did you see my phone?
You're my number one.

00:36:26.789 --> 00:36:28.040
Don't worry, just go.

00:36:49.812 --> 00:36:50.771
Oh, my.

00:36:51.939 --> 00:36:54.900
What? It's all gone.

00:37:01.574 --> 00:37:02.408
Yay.

00:37:05.411 --> 00:37:06.287
Hey, Do-ha.

00:37:11.834 --> 00:37:13.044
Has he really left?

00:37:13.753 --> 00:37:15.129
Already?

00:37:21.969 --> 00:37:23.054
NUMBER ONE

00:37:24.889 --> 00:37:27.475
Song Ha-gyeong.
You said you'd let him go.

00:37:28.309 --> 00:37:31.604
So do it cool. Like a cool girl, okay?

00:37:58.214 --> 00:38:00.508
INSTANT NOODLES

00:38:05.805 --> 00:38:07.515
THE LATE KIM AE-JEONG

00:38:15.856 --> 00:38:18.859
INSTANT NOODLES

00:38:27.576 --> 00:38:29.078
There.

00:38:50.224 --> 00:38:51.350
Is it good?

00:38:53.352 --> 00:38:54.645
Too bad I can't see…

00:38:56.605 --> 00:38:57.606
your happy face.

00:39:30.598 --> 00:39:31.599
Ae-jeong.

00:39:32.683 --> 00:39:33.601
I'll get going now.

00:39:38.314 --> 00:39:39.148
Bye-bye.

00:40:03.297 --> 00:40:04.798
Are you running away again?

00:40:16.894 --> 00:40:18.229
Seems like you're doing well.

00:40:19.688 --> 00:40:22.024
They call you "Father Teresa" in Thailand.

00:40:25.569 --> 00:40:27.196
Why do you always get new flowers?

00:40:30.658 --> 00:40:32.076
Because my Ae-jeong

00:40:33.077 --> 00:40:34.995
is just like a flower.

00:40:39.625 --> 00:40:40.918
You're so silly.

00:40:43.254 --> 00:40:46.966
Why do you stop by the Peanut House?
You don't even come inside.

00:40:50.219 --> 00:40:51.136
Did you know that?

00:40:56.016 --> 00:40:59.186
Just… checking in.

00:41:00.896 --> 00:41:04.608
I was sneaking a peek at my daughter.

00:41:05.943 --> 00:41:07.152
What are you, a water deer?

00:41:07.695 --> 00:41:08.529
What?

00:41:08.612 --> 00:41:09.905
I don't get you.

00:41:13.617 --> 00:41:14.451
Sorry.

00:41:15.536 --> 00:41:19.248
I'm always the one who runs away.

00:41:20.541 --> 00:41:22.209
After you left like that…

00:41:24.587 --> 00:41:26.088
it was always a mystery to me.

00:41:28.549 --> 00:41:30.759
"Why did Dad leave the house?"

00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:34.805
I just couldn't find the answer.

00:41:37.224 --> 00:41:39.560
That made me resent the one
who gave me the question.

00:41:41.979 --> 00:41:44.231
I couldn't find the answer,
so it drove me crazy.

00:41:46.442 --> 00:41:48.068
I felt that way the whole time.

00:41:50.988 --> 00:41:52.531
It's only natural.

00:41:55.826 --> 00:41:57.703
There's no one to give me the answer…

00:41:59.913 --> 00:42:01.498
and I never even asked.

00:42:03.292 --> 00:42:04.585
I should've just asked you,

00:42:06.086 --> 00:42:07.463
holding your hand.

00:42:10.758 --> 00:42:11.967
Then perhaps…

00:42:14.303 --> 00:42:15.596
could it have been different?

00:42:25.689 --> 00:42:27.775
You probably need time
to find the answer too.

00:42:28.901 --> 00:42:30.277
I'll wait for you until then.

00:42:33.364 --> 00:42:34.239
Thank you.

00:42:40.621 --> 00:42:41.455
But one thing.

00:42:43.082 --> 00:42:44.958
Don't run away like a water deer.

00:42:59.223 --> 00:43:02.685
It might seem like a complicated case,
but the issue is clear.

00:43:02.768 --> 00:43:06.897
It's a dispute over company ownership.
Let's take a look at the next case.

00:43:06.980 --> 00:43:08.816
Okay, let's check out the video.

00:43:08.899 --> 00:43:10.901
He's a regular here.

00:43:10.984 --> 00:43:12.611
He appears frequently on legal shows.

00:43:13.487 --> 00:43:16.699
He's on a roll with his career,
which is amazing, so I follow him.

00:43:17.282 --> 00:43:18.742
I know him a little too.

00:43:19.451 --> 00:43:20.452
Thank you.

00:43:20.994 --> 00:43:23.997
So the issue is
how the shares are divided?

00:43:24.081 --> 00:43:25.874
No, the issue is who runs the company.

00:43:25.958 --> 00:43:27.459
I'm aging day by day.

00:43:27.543 --> 00:43:29.962
And how does he keep looking so good?

00:43:30.796 --> 00:43:32.339
He's way out of reach now.

00:43:32.423 --> 00:43:34.091
I don't think I'm that far gone.

00:43:37.261 --> 00:43:40.013
No way. A celeb is in the house.

00:43:40.097 --> 00:43:42.182
I'll have the same thing, please.

00:43:42.266 --> 00:43:43.434
Coming right up.

00:43:45.477 --> 00:43:48.063
I'm not supposed to be this happy
to see my ex.

00:43:49.022 --> 00:43:50.649
Where's your current boyfriend?

00:43:52.568 --> 00:43:55.362
I hope it's not a situation
where I'm needed.

00:43:55.446 --> 00:43:57.740
Leave your card, just in case.

00:43:57.823 --> 00:43:59.908
I didn't think you'd be gone so fast.

00:44:22.723 --> 00:44:25.058
Blurring the line
between a friend and something more

00:44:25.142 --> 00:44:27.603
-can be a reason to break up, right?
-Yes, it can be.

00:44:28.937 --> 00:44:32.107
Architects work with numbers and logic.

00:44:32.191 --> 00:44:34.485
If they misinterpret,
isn't it their fault?

00:44:34.568 --> 00:44:35.903
I get it now.

00:44:36.445 --> 00:44:39.490
His head's buried in numbers,
no wonder he can't communicate.

00:44:39.573 --> 00:44:40.783
That's not true.

00:44:40.866 --> 00:44:43.786
-I speak three languages.
-Why do you keep interrupting us?

00:44:47.623 --> 00:44:49.374
You're talking to me right now.

00:44:49.458 --> 00:44:51.752
-Why not talk to me directly?
-Fine.

00:44:52.377 --> 00:44:55.297
I'm so confused right now.
Aren't you supposed to be in the US?

00:44:55.380 --> 00:44:58.425
In an era of online contracts
and working from home,

00:44:58.509 --> 00:45:00.052
a virtual meeting would suffice.

00:45:00.761 --> 00:45:03.722
But anyway,
how could you meet your ex right away?

00:45:03.805 --> 00:45:05.766
And at 10:34 p.m., at that?

00:45:06.308 --> 00:45:08.977
What could exes
possibly have to talk about,

00:45:09.061 --> 00:45:10.729
sitting side by side like that?

00:45:11.688 --> 00:45:13.941
We keep running into each other
by chance.

00:45:14.066 --> 00:45:16.860
And you asked me to see her
as a friend sometimes.

00:45:19.154 --> 00:45:21.990
Hold on a second.
That's rich coming from you.

00:45:22.074 --> 00:45:25.869
You're supposed to be in the US.
Why're you here with a girl who likes you?

00:45:25.953 --> 00:45:27.955
I find this misunderstanding
a bit offensive.

00:45:28.038 --> 00:45:30.874
I just wanted to celebrate Do-ha's return
to the Hermann project.

00:45:31.875 --> 00:45:34.336
Of course, like you said,
I do like Do-ha.

00:45:34.419 --> 00:45:37.673
-Hey.
-I was never his ex, but he's your ex.

00:45:37.756 --> 00:45:40.008
So are you Do-ha's guardian or something?

00:45:40.092 --> 00:45:42.511
Should I book you a plane ticket now?

00:45:42.594 --> 00:45:45.347
My flight's tomorrow morning anyway.
I appreciate the thought.

00:45:46.765 --> 00:45:51.895
You're with your ex-boyfriend,
but PM Yoon is just my colleague.

00:45:51.979 --> 00:45:55.107
So, you want to go back to being my ex
and my colleague?

00:45:56.066 --> 00:45:57.526
You still have my number?

00:45:58.110 --> 00:45:59.987
As you know,
I have a very high success rate

00:46:00.070 --> 00:46:01.822
in cases between couples, even divorces.

00:46:02.864 --> 00:46:04.408
How reassuring to have you around.

00:46:08.203 --> 00:46:09.329
Fine.

00:46:09.913 --> 00:46:13.250
Seems like our relationship
could use a little remodeling, right?

00:46:13.959 --> 00:46:15.043
Exactly what I want.

00:46:15.919 --> 00:46:18.755
It's time to do remodeling
once and for all.

00:46:35.063 --> 00:46:38.358
How exactly is this supposed to be
a remodel?

00:46:38.442 --> 00:46:40.444
And why am I sitting here?

00:46:42.571 --> 00:46:44.156
We need to decide

00:46:44.239 --> 00:46:46.908
who can analyze situations
and make strategic decisions.

00:46:49.911 --> 00:46:50.787
Did you see that?

00:46:51.830 --> 00:46:55.375
We're deciding who starts remodeling
our relationship.

00:47:01.089 --> 00:47:02.132
Nice.

00:47:05.093 --> 00:47:06.261
You got this, right?

00:47:30.202 --> 00:47:32.996
Despite all the scheming and tricks,
I proved myself eventually.

00:47:34.790 --> 00:47:37.459
Don't you remember who shot down
six out of eight?

00:47:37.542 --> 00:47:38.543
Whatever.

00:47:38.627 --> 00:47:41.546
Now, as the winner, I'll go ahead

00:47:41.630 --> 00:47:44.925
and start remodeling our relationship.
Everyone agrees, right?

00:47:46.009 --> 00:47:48.136
Winner makes the call. Sure.

00:47:49.638 --> 00:47:51.556
Have a good trip back to the States,
PM Yoon.

00:47:51.640 --> 00:47:53.183
Let's just meet virtually from now.

00:47:55.352 --> 00:47:57.354
You sure can make a goodbye feel harsh.

00:48:00.148 --> 00:48:01.650
You two. Shake hands.

00:48:08.699 --> 00:48:09.533
This should do it.

00:48:10.575 --> 00:48:13.704
Don't you dare call it destiny
when you run into each other.

00:48:14.913 --> 00:48:16.748
Except for weddings or funerals.

00:48:16.832 --> 00:48:19.918
Sure, why not.
Reaching agreements is my job, after all.

00:48:21.086 --> 00:48:23.630
If it's not your wedding,
it'd be fun seeing her.

00:48:24.506 --> 00:48:26.383
By the way, I'm good at hosting events.

00:48:30.721 --> 00:48:31.596
And Ha-gyeong,

00:48:33.223 --> 00:48:34.057
as for you…

00:48:58.415 --> 00:48:59.249
Hey.

00:49:00.834 --> 00:49:02.377
How did that get destroyed?

00:49:06.173 --> 00:49:08.341
Are you okay?

00:49:11.678 --> 00:49:13.054
I brought it on myself…

00:49:14.014 --> 00:49:15.265
with all that drilling.

00:49:16.767 --> 00:49:18.351
Are you blaming me?

00:49:18.435 --> 00:49:20.812
Don't you remember who caused it
in the first place?

00:49:23.648 --> 00:49:24.691
By the way,

00:49:25.984 --> 00:49:29.154
ever since I came back,
haven't you been sleeping better?

00:49:32.073 --> 00:49:33.492
So? Why do you ask?

00:49:34.785 --> 00:49:35.744
What I'm saying is,

00:49:36.244 --> 00:49:38.997
don't you want to keep sleeping well?

00:49:40.207 --> 00:49:43.251
Isn't it the same for you?
You've been sleeping like a baby.

00:49:45.462 --> 00:49:49.591
When people change and time passes,
the house should change too.

00:49:51.051 --> 00:49:53.303
We might as well renovate the whole place.

00:49:55.931 --> 00:49:56.932
Let's make it our home.

00:50:00.143 --> 00:50:01.394
For our remodeling,

00:50:02.729 --> 00:50:04.898
we agreed not to make any designs.

00:50:16.535 --> 00:50:17.494
Am I doing this right?

00:50:17.994 --> 00:50:19.538
We wanted to make a home for us…

00:50:21.331 --> 00:50:23.291
not for anyone else.

00:50:27.754 --> 00:50:28.588
Is it good?

00:50:39.558 --> 00:50:42.060
When Ha-gyeong twisted everything,

00:50:42.978 --> 00:50:44.354
I got tangled up.

00:50:45.063 --> 00:50:46.648
Red light, green light…

00:50:48.692 --> 00:50:50.527
You come here! Hey!

00:50:50.610 --> 00:50:51.862
SU-BAK

00:50:54.990 --> 00:50:57.200
Su-bak. Do you like it?

00:50:57.784 --> 00:50:59.327
In a house we designed our own way…

00:50:59.411 --> 00:51:00.704
I like it.

00:51:00.787 --> 00:51:02.122
…how will our lives

00:51:03.248 --> 00:51:04.749
get tangled?

00:51:06.585 --> 00:51:07.419
All right.

00:51:08.503 --> 00:51:11.172
Your kimchi stew is my favorite.

00:51:11.256 --> 00:51:12.299
Thank you.

00:51:12.382 --> 00:51:13.341
Thanks for the food.

00:51:13.425 --> 00:51:14.259
Eat up.

00:51:21.725 --> 00:51:24.019
Work makes food taste amazing.

00:51:24.102 --> 00:51:25.478
Without any blueprint…

00:51:26.354 --> 00:51:27.188
What was that?

00:51:27.272 --> 00:51:28.273
…how chaotic…

00:51:28.356 --> 00:51:29.566
Dig in.

00:51:29.649 --> 00:51:31.318
…and lovely are we going to be?

00:51:32.402 --> 00:51:34.195
You can't do that by yourself.

00:51:34.279 --> 00:51:36.781
-I'll help you.
-I said I can.

00:51:38.283 --> 00:51:39.868
I guess I can't. Can you…

00:51:57.552 --> 00:51:59.596
Hold on. Sorry.

00:52:00.722 --> 00:52:01.765
SEUL

00:52:01.848 --> 00:52:03.475
Come on, Seul!

00:52:05.393 --> 00:52:06.561
Hello?

00:52:06.645 --> 00:52:09.022
GOPCHANG

00:52:27.499 --> 00:52:28.541
Sir!

00:52:28.625 --> 00:52:31.086
One extra flame-grilled gopchang, please.

00:52:31.169 --> 00:52:34.673
Right, make it extra cheesy too!

00:52:35.507 --> 00:52:39.344
Hey. Take a seat.
This place is amazing.

00:52:40.887 --> 00:52:41.721
Grab a seat.

00:52:49.980 --> 00:52:51.648
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

00:52:52.357 --> 00:52:53.858
Wow, cheese gopchang.

00:53:04.411 --> 00:53:06.246
-Want some?
-Cheese gopchang.

00:53:06.329 --> 00:53:07.330
Cheese gopchang? Okay.

00:53:11.793 --> 00:53:12.752
Have some too.

00:53:12.836 --> 00:53:13.753
Okay.

00:53:18.258 --> 00:53:19.384
Hey, Baek Do.

00:53:19.926 --> 00:53:22.595
What makes you think you can build
Seung-taek's house?

00:53:24.305 --> 00:53:25.515
What, barrier-free?

00:53:26.349 --> 00:53:27.684
How did you know?

00:53:27.767 --> 00:53:29.561
My new friend told me.

00:53:30.186 --> 00:53:33.565
His name is Oh Seung-taek.
You guys probably know him.

00:53:42.282 --> 00:53:43.116
This smoky flavor.

00:53:43.825 --> 00:53:45.201
It's that smoky flavor.

00:53:45.702 --> 00:53:48.413
The smoky flavor I had with Seung-taek
back then.

00:53:51.374 --> 00:53:52.917
So good.

00:53:53.001 --> 00:53:55.045
Hey, so what's going on?

00:53:55.128 --> 00:53:57.380
-Are you seeing Seung-taek again?
-Yes!

00:53:58.006 --> 00:53:59.591
We became best friends.

00:54:00.425 --> 00:54:02.594
That's why I've been busy lately.

00:54:02.677 --> 00:54:04.721
I thought I knew him,

00:54:05.722 --> 00:54:08.475
but he keeps surprising me.

00:54:09.517 --> 00:54:11.144
Seriously, Oh Seung-taek.

00:54:12.979 --> 00:54:14.814
My buddy.

00:54:16.357 --> 00:54:19.277
Since it's just for me,
I went for an open layout.

00:54:19.360 --> 00:54:20.612
Any furniture ideas?

00:54:21.821 --> 00:54:23.281
-What?
-You said we're friends.

00:54:24.157 --> 00:54:26.034
Can you raise your head?

00:54:26.117 --> 00:54:27.786
-Okay, good.
-Okay.

00:54:29.329 --> 00:54:31.247
Why are you showing me this?

00:54:31.331 --> 00:54:32.707
Because we're friends.

00:54:33.666 --> 00:54:35.043
This is tiring.

00:54:35.960 --> 00:54:38.838
He sure knows how to draw the line.

00:54:39.380 --> 00:54:41.758
As expected from a sportsman,

00:54:41.841 --> 00:54:44.844
he's never going to let me win.

00:54:46.387 --> 00:54:47.972
Ever since his accident,

00:54:48.056 --> 00:54:51.601
we've kind of stopped sharing
our true feelings.

00:54:52.227 --> 00:54:54.395
I thought if I did, we'd break up.

00:54:55.271 --> 00:55:01.152
We got through those five years
making bets on you guys.

00:55:02.987 --> 00:55:04.489
That's the line for us.

00:55:05.573 --> 00:55:09.244
No sad stories. No painful stories.

00:55:11.704 --> 00:55:14.124
No uncomfortable stories.

00:55:21.214 --> 00:55:25.051
If getting over that line is
what it takes to become real friends,

00:55:25.135 --> 00:55:27.303
I really want to go past it.

00:55:27.387 --> 00:55:28.555
Hey.

00:55:28.638 --> 00:55:30.807
You guys must've had

00:55:30.890 --> 00:55:34.269
your own stubborn line,
like a 38th-parallel, for those 17 years.

00:55:34.352 --> 00:55:36.104
How did you get over that?

00:55:47.615 --> 00:55:49.742
SEUL

00:56:04.007 --> 00:56:04.841
Hey, Seul.

00:56:07.719 --> 00:56:09.846
Hey, buddy.

00:56:12.891 --> 00:56:14.392
How much did you drink?

00:56:14.475 --> 00:56:17.478
I just had a drink
with Baek Do-ha and Song,

00:56:18.688 --> 00:56:19.772
my best friends.

00:56:21.316 --> 00:56:24.444
And then, you know,
I wanted to see another friend too.

00:56:26.070 --> 00:56:27.989
Get up now. I can't help you up.

00:56:28.907 --> 00:56:30.116
Can you get to the car?

00:56:30.950 --> 00:56:33.703
Seung-taek.
Should we play a game too?

00:56:34.746 --> 00:56:35.872
It's called…

00:56:37.248 --> 00:56:39.000
the Song Ha-gyeong game.

00:56:39.876 --> 00:56:43.755
This is a perfect game
when you can't be honest.

00:56:43.838 --> 00:56:45.506
They say it made them honest.

00:56:46.925 --> 00:56:51.679
We've had 12 years
of dating and a breakup.

00:56:52.513 --> 00:56:54.515
There's a lot we never got to say.

00:56:56.392 --> 00:57:01.689
You have to go through stuff like this
to become real friends.

00:57:03.066 --> 00:57:06.569
If you can't be honest,
you just say the opposite.

00:57:07.111 --> 00:57:08.279
Just say the opposite?

00:57:08.363 --> 00:57:09.864
-Oh, yay.
-So?

00:57:10.365 --> 00:57:11.199
If you win?

00:57:11.950 --> 00:57:13.117
Grant a wish.

00:57:18.206 --> 00:57:20.500
I don't like being friends with you.

00:57:21.751 --> 00:57:24.254
I hate seeing you at least like this.

00:57:39.060 --> 00:57:40.895
I want to stay friends with you.

00:57:44.899 --> 00:57:47.902
Because I want you to see just me,
not anyone else.

00:57:49.779 --> 00:57:52.198
I want you to hold on to me
and stay with me,

00:57:52.282 --> 00:57:53.825
smiling even when it's tough.

00:57:55.159 --> 00:57:58.329
I hope you never do any of the things
you've missed out on because of me

00:57:59.455 --> 00:58:00.415
and cry alone…

00:58:02.875 --> 00:58:04.502
quietly without me knowing.

00:58:06.004 --> 00:58:06.838
Seung-taek.

00:58:07.964 --> 00:58:10.800
Even when I see you like that,
I don't feel sorry

00:58:10.883 --> 00:58:12.010
or hurt one bit.

00:58:12.844 --> 00:58:14.846
This thought kept coming to me

00:58:15.388 --> 00:58:19.017
and made me never want to stay
in the rink, even at midnight!

00:58:20.977 --> 00:58:24.439
So, keep clinging to me.
Beg me to at least stay friends.

00:58:25.565 --> 00:58:29.444
Every time you see me,
all those old memories will hurt you.

00:58:29.527 --> 00:58:32.238
But don't leave my side anyway.
Latch onto me like a leech.

00:58:34.657 --> 00:58:36.200
Let's be friends for life.

00:58:39.412 --> 00:58:42.123
Every time I see you
being so hard on yourself,

00:58:43.583 --> 00:58:45.251
my heart overflows with joy.

00:58:48.046 --> 00:58:52.258
Every time you pretend you're okay,
I get so thrilled I'm going crazy.

00:58:53.885 --> 00:58:55.053
So, please…

00:58:56.846 --> 00:58:58.181
Please, let's do that.

00:59:06.022 --> 00:59:07.106
Now, got it?

00:59:09.817 --> 00:59:11.361
I can't be your friend.

00:59:13.780 --> 00:59:15.239
Wait, that wasn't a lie.

00:59:19.285 --> 00:59:20.244
Congratulations.

00:59:21.204 --> 00:59:22.246
You won

00:59:23.956 --> 00:59:24.832
the last bet.

00:59:49.190 --> 00:59:50.024
Yes.

00:59:50.650 --> 00:59:52.568
I calmed her down. She's asleep.

00:59:53.069 --> 00:59:55.571
Her eyes are all puffy
after meeting Seung-taek.

00:59:56.823 --> 00:59:59.659
I'll have to stay over here tonight.

00:59:59.742 --> 01:00:02.537
I should be by her side now.
If not now, when else?

01:00:04.664 --> 01:00:05.998
I'll be home tomorrow night.

01:00:16.050 --> 01:00:16.884
Hey!

01:00:21.139 --> 01:00:23.182
It's all set and ready to go.

01:00:24.726 --> 01:00:28.146
-Why are you outside? It's cold.
-I couldn't wait to show you.

01:00:32.734 --> 01:00:33.901
All right.

01:00:33.985 --> 01:00:35.111
One.

01:00:35.653 --> 01:00:37.530
-Two. Three.
-Three.

01:00:46.664 --> 01:00:49.083
It's totally random,

01:00:50.334 --> 01:00:51.210
but somehow cozy.

01:00:52.211 --> 01:00:55.757
In my 29 years as an architect,
this is the messiest thing I've ever done,

01:00:57.049 --> 01:00:58.092
but it's my favorite.

01:00:59.719 --> 01:01:01.929
I especially love this partition line.

01:01:17.612 --> 01:01:18.946
There's only one room.

01:01:19.781 --> 01:01:21.324
How could there be two beds?

01:01:22.158 --> 01:01:23.409
This is quite a masterpiece.

01:01:23.493 --> 01:01:25.870
I recycled our partition wall
to make this bed frame.

01:01:25.953 --> 01:01:27.580
It's very meaningful.

01:01:27.663 --> 01:01:29.665
Is this why you suggested remodeling?

01:01:29.749 --> 01:01:32.335
Come on, what are you thinking?
No way.

01:01:36.547 --> 01:01:37.882
Aren't you going to lie down?

01:01:40.718 --> 01:01:41.552
It's comfy.

01:03:41.047 --> 01:03:42.423
Event? What's the occasion?

01:03:42.506 --> 01:03:44.342
My birthday! You really don't know?

01:03:44.425 --> 01:03:46.844
How could you forget
your boyfriend's birthday?

01:03:46.928 --> 01:03:48.888
You're so gorgeous. Shall we go upstairs?

01:03:50.014 --> 01:03:51.891
What are you doing here?

01:03:51.974 --> 01:03:54.936
-Are you here to see our photo too?
-No.

01:03:55.019 --> 01:03:56.270
Are you seeing someone?

01:03:58.064 --> 01:03:58.898
What's wrong?

01:03:58.981 --> 01:04:01.692
Wait, a leave of absence?
For an entire year?

01:04:01.776 --> 01:04:04.528
How am I supposed to treat you
as my daughter-in-law?

01:04:04.612 --> 01:04:07.698
I actually went there
because I wanted to see you,

01:04:07.782 --> 01:04:10.826
hoping for a Christmas miracle.

01:04:11.535 --> 01:04:13.496
Here come the bride and groom!

01:04:13.579 --> 01:04:14.830
What do you think of us?

01:04:15.915 --> 01:04:18.084
You and me. What do you think of us?
