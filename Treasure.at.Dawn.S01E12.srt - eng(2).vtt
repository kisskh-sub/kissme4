I hear

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:13.280
the roasted camel here

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:14.440
is amazing.

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:15.760
Let's have a taste.

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:18.440
We

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:19.670
are together every day.

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:22.080
How do you have time to study this?

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.240
Let me ask you something.

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.920
If there is a strange herb in the city,

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:27.960
can you notice it?

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:30.760
You have a point.

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:31.960
There you go.

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:33.280
You pay attention

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:34.430
to what interests you.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:36.480
Waiter.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.990
Bring us the roasted camel.

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:40.800
Sir,

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:41.920
I'm sorry.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.630
Roasted camels

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:45.110
are not available recently.

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.040
Why?

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:48.960
Don't you want to make money?

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.350
The Lord's Mansion is preparing for the Golden Bloom Banquet.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.070
We are keeping these camels for the Lord's Mansion.

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:55.480
What is the Golden Bloom Banquet?

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.840
Do you know?

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:59.880
The Golden Bloom Banquet

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:00.880
is an annual event

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.070
in Xichuan.

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.280
At this time of year,

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.360
the Lord's Mansion

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:06.830
auctions off weapons made of Star Gold

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.960
they collect in the past year.

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:09.960
Look at these merchants.

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:11.910
They're all here for the Golden Bloom Banquet.

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.440
So, roasted camels

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.000
are not available today.

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:17.080
How about

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:18.110
eating fish?

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.470
Fish is also our specialty.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:20.550
All right.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.110
I want a vinegar fish

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.520
and some dishes with vinegar.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:26.440
I'll leave it to you.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:27.310
Add more vinegar.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.960
Okay.

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.670
This year's Golden Bloom Banquet

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.880
was postponed several times.

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.640
I thought it wouldn't be held this year.

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.030
I didn't expect them

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.030
to suddenly announce that the event would be held the day after tomorrow.

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.030
I hurried over

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.750
without enough money.

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:45.800
What if you have enough money?

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.270
Do you dare bid against the Jibei Chamber of Commerce

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:51.750
or Xiangshui Ma Gang?

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:53.750
I don't dare.

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.360
However, they don't

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:59.550
buy all the Star Gold every year.

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.670
If we buy some of the rest,

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:03.910
we'll make a lot of money.

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:06.800
Let's keep working together this year.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:07.750
Of course.

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:09.520
Cheers.

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:12.380
Well.

[Fu Sheng to the Rescue, Golden Bloom Banquet Runs Red]

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:56.600
Fu Sheng, who comes from Shangyi,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.630
is a disciple of the miracle physician Hua Tuo.

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.840
He was brought to Shangyi by his father when he was a kid.

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:03.880
His father died in the Murder of Physicians in Shangyi.

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:06.280
Later, Fu Sheng got into a lawsuit.

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:08.230
He fled to Xichuan.

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:10.830
Gu Tian, who comes from Shangyi,

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:12.320
is an acrobatics performer.

He lives in Shangyi with his two brothers.

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.790
He and Fu Sheng are wanted.

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:19.790
He also fled to Xichuan.

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:22.960
Feng Qianli, you are truly worthy of being a black-clothed detective

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.990
of the Hearsay-capturing Pavilion.

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:25.280
You found out

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.640
all about them in a few days.

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:30.200
You're overqualified for a detective.

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.430
Why don't you come to the Lord's Mansion and help me?

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:35.720
Thank you for valuing me.

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.350
If you can buy

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:40.310
the Hearsay-capturing Pavilion,

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.120
I'll be your man.

No one knows who he is.

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.080
I don't want to offend him.

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:55.200
Our master has heard of you.

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:56.350
You'll

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.280
see each other in the future.

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:21.430
Look.

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:35.550
It seems that Fu Sheng's acquaintance with the Young Mistress

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:36.430
was an accident.

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:38.230
It doesn't look like it was planned.

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:43.960
Have the Ma Gang and the Chamber of Commerce

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:45.040
made any moves lately?

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:47.990
They heard

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:49.470
about your condition.

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:52.550
The Ma Gang and the Chamber of Commerce have made many moves.

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:54.470
There was a lot of friction between them.

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:55.840
Over the years,

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:59.040
we have valued peace.

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:02.270
As a result, they forgot

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:03.990
what we made our fortune from.

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:08.520
The Golden Bloom Banquet cannot be delayed any longer.

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:11.760
I need to convert my Star Gold into money as soon as possible.

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:13.300
But your body...

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:14.430
Don't worry.

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:16.430
I can hold on.

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:17.790

Physician Fu.

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:33.470
You can be honest.

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:35.600
Am I terminally ill?

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:36.660
Don't talk.

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:37.840
Another arm.

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:43.960
You recently

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:46.990
have you had chest pain

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:48.520
and tightness lately?

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:52.550
I had them the night before last.

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:53.550
I was all right after a while.

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:55.400
The night before last.

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:58.200
Did you eat

00:06:58.200 --> 00:06:58.990
more than usual that night?

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:00.160
How do you know that?

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:02.760
My brother braised a pork shoulder that night.

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:03.520
I ate a lot.

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:04.640
That's right.

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:05.550
You have a heart disease.

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:07.400
But my arm hurts.

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:09.110
It's caused by your heart disease.

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:12.520
Can this disease be cured?

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:14.840
It can only be gradually conditioned.

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:16.870
I'll give you a prescription.

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:18.990
Take the medicine for seven days.

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:19.760
Remember,

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:21.470
have a light diet in the future.

00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:22.720
Eat less meat or fish.

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:29.200
Here you go.

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:31.600
Follow this prescription.

00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:33.110
Take the medicine twice a day.

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:34.840
Boil three bowls of water into one bowl.

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:36.230
I'll revisit you

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:36.960
in seven days.

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:39.310

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:40.040
You're welcome.

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:41.640
Thank you.

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:51.680
How's it going?

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:52.520
I found it.

00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:54.120
There was a shop in the city

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:56.000
that once sold Western tussah silk.

00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:56.960
Feng Qianli said

00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:58.680
you could try your luck there.

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:14.270
I hear you have stuff from all over the world.

00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:17.150
If you want something, find it yourself.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.390
You don't look familiar.

00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:35.280
I heard it from the Hearsay-capturing Pavilion.

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:40.200
They serve all those who pay them.

00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:42.040
They always give me trouble.

00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:43.560
Go ahead.

00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:44.520

00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:46.800
Western tussah silk.

00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:03.320
Is that all there is?

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:05.280
It's good to have that.

00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:06.750
Every time you use it,

00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:08.080
it gets stretched.

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:10.470
If you want it to last long,

00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:11.470
you should mix it with newly produced silk.

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:12.320
If you want it,

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:14.320
you can raise some Western silkworms.

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:17.590
Show me the Western silkworms.

00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:18.320
I don't have them.

00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:19.560
They only eat

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:20.800
fire mulberry leaves unique to the West.

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:22.800
I can't afford to raise them.

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:27.160
Where can I

00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:29.080
get fire mulberry leaves in Xichuan?

00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:31.160
I think the Jibei Chamber of Commerce has some.

00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:50.680
Siming, you're awake.

00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:52.470
How are you feeling?

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:54.630
You're the backbone

00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:56.480
of our family.

00:09:57.170 --> 00:09:58.680
If something happens to you,

00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:01.870
what should I do?

00:10:08.110 --> 00:10:09.040
Siming.

00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:11.710
Pretty women are vixens.

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:13.550
Incompetent men

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:15.400
will die because of women.

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:18.590
You

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:19.870
are my sister-in-law.

00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:21.350
We shouldn't get too close.

00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:23.900
The eldest sister-in-law is like a mother.

00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:26.350
You should listen to me.

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:27.630
Come on.

00:10:27.830 --> 00:10:30.990
Show me your wound.

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:32.080
Where's my brother?

00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:34.890
Don't worry.

00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:35.990
Your brother is not here.

00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:37.830
He went fishing.

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:39.620
He wanted

00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:42.030
to give you a nutritional boost.

00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:44.040
No one else is at home.

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:46.430
Let me see.

00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:48.000
Is it here?

00:10:48.010 --> 00:10:49.190
Or here?

00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:50.720
Is your wound here?

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:52.160
Let's see.

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:53.040
Gu Tian.

00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:55.950
Why is no one home?

00:10:57.070 --> 00:10:58.120
Don't leave.

00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:06.550
Sister-in-law.

00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:08.160
This is my friend Gu Tian.

00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:09.430
He came to see me.

00:11:09.950 --> 00:11:10.910
Make some dishes.

00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:12.120
We'll have a couple of drinks at noon.

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:13.830
No need.

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:15.120
Don't bother.

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:16.710
No, you must stay.

00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:25.120
Good for you.

00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:26.190
All right.

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:28.070
What do you want to see me about?

00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:36.300
[Jibei Chamber of Commerce]

00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:37.550
Zhu, how many buckets have you taken out?

00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:40.910
It’s early. There's only a few.

00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:42.970
Be careful not to be scolded by the steward like yesterday.

00:11:42.970 --> 00:11:43.370
Yes.

00:11:48.390 --> 00:11:49.760
Why are you avoiding me?

00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:51.760
Will I eat you?

00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:54.590
You, come here.

00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:56.880
Come here.

00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:01.110
Steward.

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:02.630
Don't you want to work for me?

00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:04.160
No.

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:05.960
So, you want to work for me.

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:07.040
Yes.

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:07.870
Go to the warehouse

00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:10.230
and get me a piece of cloth made of tussah silk.

00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:13.110
I want to make a dress for my sister-in-law.

00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:16.990
What do you mean?

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:18.510
The Western tussah silk

00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:19.750
is worth as much as gold.

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:21.870
You can't use it to make clothes.

00:12:22.110 --> 00:12:23.870
Is it so precious?

00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:25.040
It is precious.

00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:26.990
The Western tussah silk

00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:28.960
is produced by live Western silkworms.

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:30.040
The Western silkworms

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:32.680
only eat fire mulberry leaves unique to the Western.

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:33.990
So,

00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:35.960
it's very precious.

00:12:37.630 --> 00:12:39.710
Are there fire mulberry leaves in the warehouse?

00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:42.080
Yes, there are.

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:43.080
Cut the nonsense.

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:45.870
Take out the fire mulberry leaves and feed them to the Western silkworms.

00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:47.560
Steward Zhao took all the share

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:49.200
of fire mulberry leaves.

00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:51.230
Is there nothing left?

00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:52.510
Yes.

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:53.920
All this time,

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:55.870
the fire mulberry leaves were only for Steward Zhao's use.

00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:57.680
We buy a batch only after using up a batch,

00:12:57.870 --> 00:12:59.160
without exception.

00:13:14.830 --> 00:13:15.350
What are these?

00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:16.340
I picked them.

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:17.470
It's too sour. Here you go.

00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:22.590
I found the guy who used tussah silk.

00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:25.280
Who is that?

00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:27.230
Steward Zhao of the Jibei Chamber of Commerce.

00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:30.750
Steward Zhao.

00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:34.990
Steward Zhao and Li Zhizhuo

00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:36.320
are always together.

00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:38.520
This is further proof

00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:40.960
that Li Zhizhuo is involved.

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:43.160
It also confirms what we said at that time.

00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:45.340
But...

00:13:46.510 --> 00:13:47.800
What are you going to do next?

00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:49.120
It's the Golden Bloom Banquet tomorrow night.

00:13:49.510 --> 00:13:50.800
I'll look for an opportunity to expose him.

00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:52.750
By bringing Li Zhizhuo down,

00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:54.920
we'll open the first breakthrough

00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:55.920
to approach Breakwall.

00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:04.710
The Golden Bloom Banquet has been lively

00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:06.080
in previous years.

00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:07.560
This year...

00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:08.690
Mr. Qi.

00:14:09.590 --> 00:14:10.350
Mr. Luo.

00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:12.630
Your skin is glowing.

00:14:12.630 --> 00:14:14.920
Your business must be good.

00:14:15.870 --> 00:14:16.870
It's all thanks to you

00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:18.510
and other bosses.

00:14:19.510 --> 00:14:20.040
Mr. Luo.

00:14:20.630 --> 00:14:22.240
You will

00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:24.990
get some Star Gold this year, right?

00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:27.560
It's all at the Chamber of Commerce's disposal.

00:14:28.510 --> 00:14:30.350
It doesn't matter who gets the Star Gold.

00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:31.710
The Star Gold

00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:35.230
ends up in the hands of the Jibei Chamber of Commerce.

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:38.470
That being said,

00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:41.670
the Chamber of Commerce will owe you one.

00:14:42.470 --> 00:14:43.560
What are you talking about?

00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:45.280
Mr. Xubu.

00:14:48.830 --> 00:14:50.920
Mr. Luo, you earned a lot last year.

00:14:51.510 --> 00:14:52.920
You're wearing a lot of gold and silver.

00:14:53.830 --> 00:14:54.870
You look better than me.

00:14:55.510 --> 00:14:57.830
It's all thanks to you.

00:14:57.920 --> 00:14:58.560
Really?

00:14:58.870 --> 00:15:00.160
Looks like I took good care of you.

00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:03.320
You should help me today, right?

00:15:03.510 --> 00:15:05.510
Get me a batch of weapons and send them to the Ma Gang.

00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:07.230
I'll pay you 10% more.

00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:11.470
I...

00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:12.680
Isn't it enough?

00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:13.230
No.

00:15:13.710 --> 00:15:14.440
What about 20%?

00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:15.160
No.

00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:16.400
No.

00:15:16.650 --> 00:15:17.320
Luo.

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:18.590
No.

00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:20.990
Don't push your luck.

00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:23.200
What?

00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:25.980
Don't you need the Ma Gang next year?

00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:27.360
Mr. Xubu.

00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:29.670
It's not about money.

00:15:30.590 --> 00:15:32.380
This year, all major businessmen

00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:34.410
have already received an order from the Jibei Chamber of Commerce.

00:15:34.710 --> 00:15:37.510
The Chamber of Commerce is staring at all weapons

00:15:37.510 --> 00:15:39.040
on the Golden Bloom Banquet.

00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:42.160
They have ordered us to listen to them.

00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:44.230
Our families and shops

00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:46.800
are in Jibei.

00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:50.470
We dare not disobey them.

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:52.710
They are so arrogant.

00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:54.630
The banquet hasn't started yet.

00:15:54.630 --> 00:15:56.350
Someone is fawning.

00:15:58.230 --> 00:15:59.160
Mr. Chairman,

00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:01.680
shall we tip him for the city lord?

00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:03.830
Do you want to die?

00:16:03.830 --> 00:16:04.630
Xubu Huai.

00:16:05.630 --> 00:16:07.230
Before hitting a dog, find out who its master is.

00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:08.470
You're over the line.

00:16:08.710 --> 00:16:09.630
Li.

00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:12.280
You became the Chairman.

00:16:12.870 --> 00:16:15.040
But you're nothing to me.

00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:17.920
We don't know who will win

00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:18.960
on the Golden Bloom Banquet.

00:16:19.470 --> 00:16:20.800
Don't get cocky.

00:16:27.510 --> 00:16:28.350
Vulgar.

00:16:29.230 --> 00:16:31.160
You're like a vulgar woman.

00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:35.130
I haven't asked you

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:37.260
if you like the woman I gave you.

00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:41.050
Thank you for giving me a sister-in-law.

00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:42.430
Sister-in-law?

00:16:43.710 --> 00:16:45.440
My brother hasn't married yet.

00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:47.950
It's inappropriate for me to get married first.

00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:51.850
Okay.

00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:53.960
She'll be your sister-in-law.

00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:55.640
I'll ask Steward Zhao

00:16:55.830 --> 00:16:57.400
to get you a wife.

00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:00.410
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:10.820
[Chunyun House]

00:17:27.710 --> 00:17:28.310
Leader.

00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:29.640
You were right.

The Jibei Chamber of Commerce has been playing dirty all these years.

They're controlling the buyers

00:17:35.550 --> 00:17:37.200
of the Star Gold weapons.

00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:39.660
I felt them out.

00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:43.310
The Jibei Chamber of Commerce

00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:45.160
is determined to get all Star Gold weapons this year.

00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:49.750
I knew they were playing dirty.

00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:51.920
They bought many good weapons.

00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:52.750
Where are they hiding them?

00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:55.600
We can't let them win this year.

00:17:55.710 --> 00:17:57.510
Should we get some businessmen to help us

00:17:57.710 --> 00:17:58.750
fight them?

00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:01.550
We'll fight them.

00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:03.990
But Ma Gang is straightforward.

00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:06.070
We'll fight them above board.

00:18:07.270 --> 00:18:07.920
Let's go.

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:09.070
If they wait too long,

00:18:09.070 --> 00:18:11.640
they will say that we are rude.

all the Star Gold weapons.

Xubu Huai meant something other.

The Ma Gang won't let me take them easily.

00:18:37.070 --> 00:18:39.310
They are no match for us in terms of wealth.

00:18:39.710 --> 00:18:41.550
But we need to be wary of them getting desperate

00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:43.270
and robbing our weapons.

00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:44.640
Got it.

00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:45.680
I'll take someone

00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:47.030
to keep an eye on them

00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:48.920
in case they get in our way.

00:18:51.550 --> 00:18:51.840

It's Fu Sheng.

He promised me to join me at the banquet.

Mr. Gu, please spare me.

00:28:00.470 --> 00:28:01.200
It turns out

00:28:01.710 --> 00:28:03.680
that you are awake.

00:28:04.710 --> 00:28:06.440
I thought I hit you too hard.

00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:08.510
I couldn't wake you up.

00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:09.840
Mr. Gu.

00:28:10.030 --> 00:28:11.440
Don't joke with me.

00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:12.470
Wait.

00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:13.640
Young heroes.

00:28:14.070 --> 00:28:15.200
What have I

00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:16.750
done to you?

00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:18.780
Is there a misunderstanding?

00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:20.230
No.

00:28:20.990 --> 00:28:22.600
We invited you here

00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:24.120
to ask something.

00:28:24.470 --> 00:28:25.990
I am a steward.

00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:27.610
You can ask me questions directly.

00:28:27.790 --> 00:28:28.990
You didn't have to do this.

00:28:28.990 --> 00:28:29.400
Right?

00:28:29.710 --> 00:28:31.120
I gave you a chance.

00:28:31.470 --> 00:28:32.640
You didn't cherish it.

00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:39.070
Steward Zhao.

00:28:39.310 --> 00:28:41.440
We do have something to ask you.

00:28:42.270 --> 00:28:43.710
I'll tell you everything.

00:28:43.990 --> 00:28:45.230
I killed Song Jingye.

00:28:45.230 --> 00:28:46.510
Li Zhizhuo gave me the order.

00:28:50.070 --> 00:28:51.680
Do you know about Breakwall?

00:28:54.710 --> 00:28:57.230
All ten weapons have been auctioned off.

00:28:57.310 --> 00:28:58.640
Thank you, gentlemen.

00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:00.440
- Amazing. - Amazing.

00:29:02.470 --> 00:29:03.070
Your Excellency.

00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:04.600
The average price of lots

00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:06.030
in the last round was 1.5 million coins.

00:29:06.310 --> 00:29:07.160
That's unchanged from previous years.

00:29:07.990 --> 00:29:09.680
Small businessmen have limited financial resources.

00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:12.120
I don't think they'll be bidding anymore.

00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:14.360
It's all right.

00:29:14.890 --> 00:29:16.080
The important auction

00:29:16.310 --> 00:29:18.520
will be between the Ma Gang and the Chamber of Commerce.

00:29:20.390 --> 00:29:21.960
The Ma Gang has never won

00:29:22.070 --> 00:29:23.040
in all these years.

00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:24.390
Jiu.

00:29:24.630 --> 00:29:25.630
Father knows what he's doing.

00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:27.110
Let's enjoy the show.

00:29:28.550 --> 00:29:30.070
Jue is right.

00:29:33.790 --> 00:29:34.550
Next,

00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:38.680
it's a spear, a shield, a bow, and an armor.

00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:39.870
With this set,

00:29:40.350 --> 00:29:41.440
the world is your hand.

00:29:42.150 --> 00:29:43.790
The price is eight million coins.

00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:45.790
Gentlemen, please.

00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:51.170
Mr. Chairman.

00:29:51.540 --> 00:29:53.870
In previous years, the price

00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:56.150
of a set of weapons is about four million coins.

00:29:56.830 --> 00:29:58.110
Why is it so expensive this year?

00:29:58.760 --> 00:29:59.550
What do you think?

00:30:06.150 --> 00:30:08.310
I'll take it.

00:30:09.830 --> 00:30:11.630
Leader Che has a good eye.

00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:13.350
Congratulations to Leader Che.

00:30:13.350 --> 00:30:15.770
- Great. - Great.

00:30:17.830 --> 00:30:20.110
Che is enlightened.

00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:21.520
It's nothing.

00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:23.390
The best is yet to come.

00:30:24.310 --> 00:30:25.520
Am I right, Mr. Chairman?

00:30:26.070 --> 00:30:26.870
It's fine.

00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:28.520
Since he likes it,

00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:29.960
I'll let him have it.

00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:32.150
The second set.

00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:34.070
Ten million coins.

00:30:36.070 --> 00:30:37.070
I'll take it.

00:30:38.630 --> 00:30:40.110
Congratulations to Leader Che.

00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:42.910
- Great. - Great.

00:30:42.910 --> 00:30:44.380
Leader Che, you're generous.

00:30:44.620 --> 00:30:45.630
You're generous.

00:30:46.350 --> 00:30:47.680
Are they crazy?

00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:50.920
The price is two or three times higher than in previous years.

00:30:51.070 --> 00:30:52.000
Why do they still want it?

00:30:52.310 --> 00:30:53.200
Congratulations, Your Excellency.

00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:54.550
We have gained a lot today.

00:30:58.320 --> 00:30:58.910
Your Excellency.

00:31:00.830 --> 00:31:01.240
Father.

00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:02.040
What's wrong?

00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:04.720
Keep quiet about it.

00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:06.890
Keep quiet about it.

00:31:07.070 --> 00:31:10.830
The third set, 18 million coins.

00:31:12.150 --> 00:31:13.720
I'll take it as well.

00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:16.440
It's interesting.

00:31:18.550 --> 00:31:20.110
Congratulations to Leader Che.

00:31:20.350 --> 00:31:22.200
- Amazing. - Amazing.

00:31:22.490 --> 00:31:24.620
- Amazing. - Amazing.

00:31:26.550 --> 00:31:27.790
Che is crazy.

00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:31.280
There have been many letters exchanged

00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:33.680
between Li Zhizhuo and Breakwall over the years.

00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:34.960
But I've never seen a man

00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:36.910
from Breakwall.

00:31:37.870 --> 00:31:40.240
What was in those letters?

00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:40.960
I don't know.

00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:42.480
Li Zhizhuo never let me see it.

00:31:42.870 --> 00:31:43.590
But I think

00:31:43.590 --> 00:31:44.880
the letters

00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:46.110
were about difficult things.

00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:48.280
For example,

00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:51.790
looking for the Bird Jade Plate.

00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:57.200
You know a lot.

00:31:58.240 --> 00:31:58.630
Yes.

00:31:59.110 --> 00:32:00.920
The bounty notice was issued by Li Zhizhuo.

00:32:01.070 --> 00:32:02.200
Because of this,

00:32:02.390 --> 00:32:04.440
Song Jingye went to Li Zhizhuo

00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:05.520
and questioned him.

00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:06.830
And because of that,

00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:09.920
Li Zhizhuo was determined to get rid of Song Jingye.

00:32:14.830 --> 00:32:16.960
We want to uncover the truth about Song Jingye's death.

00:32:17.630 --> 00:32:19.350
Would you like to be our witness?

00:32:20.070 --> 00:32:21.150
No problem.

00:32:22.140 --> 00:32:23.890
I can help you take down Li Zhizhuo.

00:32:24.230 --> 00:32:25.580
I'll die anyway.

00:32:26.090 --> 00:32:28.130
I'd like to take him down with me.

00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:32.550
You guys

00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:34.280
have a great relationship.

00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:37.240
Well.

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:39.200
Did you bring the tussah silk?

00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:43.830
Now, the last item.

00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:46.550
It's also the highlight of this year's Golden Bloom Banquet.

00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:47.830
Let's invite Mr. Wen

00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:50.480
to tell you about it.

00:32:51.310 --> 00:32:53.180
Good.

00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:54.520
Good.

00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:55.760
Good.

00:33:06.070 --> 00:33:07.440
I tripped.

00:33:07.830 --> 00:33:08.630
Please forgive me, Your Excellency.

00:33:29.390 --> 00:33:30.200
Today,

00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:33.390
we have many friends from both inside and outside Xichuan.

00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:35.480
It's an honor to have you here.

00:33:35.830 --> 00:33:36.960
As a symbol of our goodwill,

00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:39.310
I prepared an item

00:33:39.550 --> 00:33:43.070
as the highlight of this year's Golden Bloom Banquet.

00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:54.040
It's the Star Gold.

00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:54.870
It's real.

00:33:54.870 --> 00:33:55.940
- That's a big piece. - It must be of great value.

00:33:55.940 --> 00:33:57.530
- That's a big piece. - That one?

00:33:57.580 --> 00:33:58.590
- How much is that worth? - Right.

00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:01.770
This is the Star Gold.

00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:03.870
It weighs 1200 grams.

00:34:04.550 --> 00:34:06.550
You may wonder

00:34:06.830 --> 00:34:09.670
why such a small piece of Star Gold

00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:12.360
is the highlight of this year's Golden Bloom Banquet.

00:34:12.710 --> 00:34:15.070
I can responsibly tell you

00:34:16.070 --> 00:34:19.040
that the amount of Star Gold

00:34:19.630 --> 00:34:23.740
in all the weapons you just saw

00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:27.870
is less than 200 grams.

00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:34.800
How many weapons can it make?

00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:38.880
You can guess

00:34:39.150 --> 00:34:41.190
how much this piece of Star Gold

00:34:41.670 --> 00:34:44.040
is worth.

00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:46.320
And

00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:49.480
the person who buys it

00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:52.070
can go to our Lord's Mansion

00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:54.320
to customize weapons for you.

00:34:54.710 --> 00:34:57.630
We won't let you down.

00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:03.040
Its price

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:05.360
is forty million coins.

00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:07.270
Forty million coins.

00:35:09.150 --> 00:35:10.070
Gentlemen,

00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:11.980
please.

00:35:15.550 --> 00:35:16.270
What?

00:35:16.670 --> 00:35:19.150
Wealthy Jibei Chamber of Commerce,

00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:21.440
can't you afford it?

00:35:24.150 --> 00:35:25.070
Lord Wen.

00:35:26.270 --> 00:35:28.440
Can we buy it with gold?

00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:29.440
Yes.

00:35:30.070 --> 00:35:30.840
One gold

00:35:31.230 --> 00:35:32.040
is worth 10 thousand coins.

00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:34.040
You can buy it

00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:36.000
with gold.

00:35:38.750 --> 00:35:40.670
Today's prices are much higher than before.

00:35:41.270 --> 00:35:43.070
Since we can buy it with gold,

00:35:43.960 --> 00:35:46.000
I'll check my deposit.

00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:48.840
Please wait a moment.

00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:51.750
Gentlemen.

00:35:52.110 --> 00:35:53.480
While you're waiting,

00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:55.270
please watch Xichuan's acrobatics performance.

00:35:56.070 --> 00:35:57.480
We'll continue

00:35:57.960 --> 00:35:59.150
in ten minutes.

00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:03.440
Ask Steward Zhao

00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:05.110
to interrupt the Golden Bloom Banquet.

00:36:17.550 --> 00:36:18.360
Where is Steward Zhao?

00:36:19.070 --> 00:36:20.070
I don't know.

00:36:29.110 --> 00:36:30.800
Mr. Chairman, Steward Zhao is gone.

Lord Wen, aren't you going to do something?

00:39:57.360 --> 00:39:58.230
I ordered him

00:39:58.590 --> 00:40:00.920
to find out the real murderer.

00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:04.150

Okay.

00:40:15.070 --> 00:40:16.750
Since Lord Wen said so,

00:40:17.840 --> 00:40:19.880
I want to know the truth.

00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:22.270
Let him tell everyone

00:40:22.710 --> 00:40:24.610
who is behind all this.

00:40:24.840 --> 00:40:26.590
All right. Come on.

00:40:27.270 --> 00:40:28.230
Tell them.

00:40:32.150 --> 00:40:34.670
Yeah, tell us.

00:40:37.630 --> 00:40:38.480
It's...

00:40:40.670 --> 00:40:41.480
Me.

00:40:51.550 --> 00:40:52.710
He must have

00:40:52.710 --> 00:40:55.230
been ordered to kill.

00:40:56.040 --> 00:40:57.110
He didn't

00:40:57.110 --> 00:40:58.630
dare to kill.

00:40:58.960 --> 00:40:59.840
Why don't we

00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:02.480
find out who's behind this?

00:41:02.670 --> 00:41:03.800
What do you say, Chairman Li?

00:41:04.940 --> 00:41:05.920
You don't have proof.

00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:07.730
Don't slander me.

00:41:08.630 --> 00:41:09.610
Lord Wen, you...

00:41:10.910 --> 00:41:11.430
Your Excellency.

00:41:11.430 --> 00:41:12.190
Father.

What happened?

00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:21.520
People in Xichuan

00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:23.360
have recently rumored

00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:25.040
that Lord Wen is sick.

00:41:25.270 --> 00:41:26.960
Looks like it's true.

00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:28.590
Chairman Li,

00:41:29.630 --> 00:41:31.320
do you want to do something about it?

00:41:32.480 --> 00:41:34.810
I'm worried about Lord Wen.

00:41:35.630 --> 00:41:37.150
Che, what are you talking about?

00:41:37.630 --> 00:41:39.070
Don't you worry about Lord Wen?

00:41:40.750 --> 00:41:41.800
These two gangs

00:41:42.070 --> 00:41:43.150
are stirring.

00:41:44.150 --> 00:41:46.480
If Lord Wen can't wake up soon,

00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:49.070
the balance of Xichuan will be broken.

00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:50.840
And we will die here.

00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:52.590
Fu Sheng.

00:41:52.730 --> 00:41:53.660
What do we do now?

00:41:56.750 --> 00:41:57.920
Put Lord Wen down.

00:41:57.920 --> 00:41:58.630
I'll give him acupuncture.

00:41:58.630 --> 00:41:59.270
Okay.

00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:23.090

00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:24.690
