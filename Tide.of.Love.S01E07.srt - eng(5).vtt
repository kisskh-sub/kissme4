Eat the porridge.
-Han Jaehun.

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:49.800
This is...

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:51.820
A note written by Hyung.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:54.200
Even the handwriting

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.350
is just like him—

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.250
clean, proper, and pretty.

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.000
I didn't know he studied architecture.

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.300
The blueprints he draws are amazing.

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.000
Yet now, he's making me a bowl of porridge.

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:16.520
That's when I realized

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.750
what attracts me the most

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.770
is not Han Jaehun who looks stronger than anyone professionally,

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:26.500
but him who thinks and cares for me

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:28.700
like this.

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:31.150
What were you doing?

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.150
Han Jaehun.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:35.220
Yes?

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.570
What is this?

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.950
This was from a long time ago.

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:45.400
Exactly.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
So why do you still keep this?

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:51.020
Are you jealous?

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:53.470
Who said I was jealous?

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:55.950
I just feel a little uncomfortable.

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.600
Hmm.

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:14.020
There's only

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:16.170
you here.

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:18.700
Only Kim Haejun.

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.750
Let's go, jealous boy.

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:31.850
Let's go.

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:40.550
I made this. Drink it.

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:45.180
Drink it.

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:51.050
You should try some too.

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:52.820
No, you should try some too.

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:07.350
Ouch. It's hot.

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:14.070
Good work.

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:15.370
Haejun.

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:17.470
Well...

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:19.750
Wait. Excuse me.

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:28.500
Hi, Mom.

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:31.920
I'm having dinner with my friends.

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.770
It's his birthday today

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:38.620
so I made your famous noodles for him.

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.070
You said one would live long
if they eat noodles on their birthday.

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:45.920
He's my best friend.

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:48.570
Okay.

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:49.800
I love you.

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:51.070
Bye.

00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:59.820
I'm so touched.

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:04.500
Don't get me wrong.

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:06.070
I got dust in my eyes.

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:10.700
This is the first time

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:15.300
someone wished me happy birthday.

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:20.200
When I was young,

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:24.320
it was my father's secretary who'd deliver an envelope/Non my birthday every year.

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:28.670
It was a lot if money,

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:32.600
but I was never once told,
"Let's have a meal."

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.500
As for my mother...

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:40.270
My mother

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:43.350
passed away before I could remember—

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.500
disappeared just like smoke.

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:53.620
So I always thought birthdays were quiet.

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:57.950
But you're different.

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:03.150
You were complaining
about tearing up when cutting onions

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:05.870
yet was answering your mum's phone
with a smile,

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:08.970
and made me noodles.

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:14.570
This bowl of noodles

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:17.270
is the first bowl of hot noodles

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:20.570
made by someone important to me.

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:16.470
I'm not good at words,

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.820
but my smile is real.

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:28.070
Hyung.

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:32.820
I'll wipe your tears.

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:40.050
I'll always be by your side.

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:42.800
So,

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:47.220
don't feel uneasy anymore.

00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:38.419
Who told you to do that?

00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:40.789
That's cheating.

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:56.350
Hyung!

00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:06.050
Hyung.

00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:08.420
Let's eat cake.

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:10.550
You haven't eaten anything yet.

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:25.250
Hey! What are you doing?

00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:27.190
You got cream on your face.
