[Reborn from the Ashes]

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.440
[Episode 9]

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:20.710
My Lord,

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:22.030
so many lotus roots.

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:23.710
Can you finish all of them?

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.190
Lotus roots stay connected
even when broken.

[Wing Room]

[Prince Zhenbei's Mansion]
Qi.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:39.670
Are you alright?

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.030
Mother...

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.030
I feel like I am going
to see Great Grandmother.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.230
That bad seed!

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:48.480
Don't worry.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.630
I won't spare a single one.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.440
Speaking of which,

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:57.070
why does she look so much
like Wen Yueqian?

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.760
Didn't you personally throw her
off the cliff?

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:01.400
Yes, Mother.

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.190
Not only did I throw her off the cliff,

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:06.710
I also ruined her face

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:08.510
and gouged out her eyes.

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:10.760
She probably won't survive.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.920
Could Wen Yueqian have turned
into a vengeful ghost

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:16.800
to demand my life?

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:17.760
What is there to fear?

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:19.980
There are no such things
as ghosts in this world.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.480
It's more likely someone
is pretending to be one.

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:26.230
I remember

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:28.800
Wen Yueqian can't eat cherries.

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:31.760
If she eats them,
she will break out in a rash

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.150
and even struggle to breathe.

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.230
Then let's find a chance

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.400
to test her properly.

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.360
If she really is that vile woman,

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.550
I'll make sure she goes back to hell
once more.

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.230
Qingran,

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.850
I'm sorry to offend you
when you offered tea that day.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.590
Today, I come to apologize.

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:03.710
Please forgive me.

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.440
These are freshly picked fruits
and some small gifts.

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:12.710
Qi, you're truly too polite.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.030
You don't have to do that.

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:15.400
I've already

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.070
forgotten the past.

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:21.630
What?

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:25.150
Is it that my things can't
catch your eyes?

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.510
Or is it that you won't forgive me?

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.190
If I don't forgive you,

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.880
will you insult me again

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:34.880
like you did that day?

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.920
Qingran,

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:39.190
I spoke without thinking that day.

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:40.230
I know I was wrong.

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.030
Qingran,

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.320
what must I do to earn your forgiveness?

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.320
You speak hurtful words,
and you naturally deserve a slap.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.630
Slap yourself five times.

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:52.840
Then I'll forgive you.

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:53.590
You...

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.400
Looks like you still lack sincerity.

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:59.880
Please leave.

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.630
I...

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.920
Is that enough?

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:10.760
Your sincerity isn't enough.

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.300
This woman is so aggressive.

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:17.100
She's completely different
from Wen Yueqian.

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.250
Could it be that they just happen
to look the same?

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:20.190
No,

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:21.760
to be absolutely sure,

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.030
I must make her eat the cherries.

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:28.320
Qingran, are you satisfied?

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:29.190
So-so.

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:53.030
It's really sweet.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.280
Qi, have one too.

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:56.440
Alright.

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:58.510
No rash appeared on her body.

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:00.760
Could it be that she's really not
Wen Yueqian?

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:03.150
Honey.

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:11.110
Qi, I was mistaken.

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.710
I thought it was Jin who returned.

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:15.110
Are you alright?

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:16.550
You didn't choke, did you?

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:17.960
Let me help you.

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:19.800
I know how to do this.

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:20.440
Come on.

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:21.150
Just like this.

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.760
No need.

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:24.070
Has it come out yet?

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:26.110
Let me do it again.

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.400
Maybe I didn't hit hard enough.

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:31.550
Let me try one more punch.

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:33.880
This last one.

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:34.910
It will come out for sure.

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:41.280
Qi,

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.960
I told you

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:44.170
this trick really works.

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:45.320
Before,

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:47.000
my neighbor choked on a loquat.

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:48.990
The physician used this method
to get it out.

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:52.280
Hey, Qi,

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:54.630
I just saved you.

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:56.630
You didn't even say thank you.

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.800
Is this really how they teach manners
in the Mansion?

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:03.800
Thank you for saving my life.

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:05.070
You're welcome.

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:07.070
But just now,

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:09.110
I slapped you a few times.

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:12.800
You won't hold a grudge
against me, right?

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:16.190
You was just saving me.

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:17.670
How could I possibly hold a grudge?

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:32.480
Qingran,

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:34.670
since when did you and Qi get so close?

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:37.190
Qi

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:39.440
just sent over a bunch of cherries.

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:41.920
So...

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:43.190
So...

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:45.550
I feel so dizzy.

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:54.640
[Hot Spring, Prince Zhenbei's Mansion]

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:10.480
You're awake.

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:35.550
Wanyan Jin.

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:40.800
Wanyan Jin, are you alright?

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:42.710
Defend the homeland!

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:44.710
Face death fearlessly!

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:45.510
Brothers,

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:46.880
cheers!

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:49.360
Cheers!

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:52.000
March!

00:06:57.070 --> 00:07:01.880
If we hadn't been poisoned, we wouldn't
have suffered so many losses.

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:06.280
I'm afraid I won't last much longer.

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:09.150
This jade pendant belonged
to an old friend of mine.

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:10.920
You must take good care of it.

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:12.590
Father.

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:13.320
Take it.

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:25.070
Father, reinforcements have arrived.

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:32.230
Wanyan Lie,

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:34.030
what does this mean?

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:39.000
The Qilin Army is really amazing.

00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:42.510
Despite being poisoned,
you still can push back the enemy.

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:45.190
You poisoned us?

00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:48.400
Unfortunately, you realized it too late.

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:53.000
You shouldn't have stood in my way.

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:55.550
You abused your power
to embezzle military funds.

00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:57.320
That is a grave crime.

00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:59.880
Do you dare to kill me to cover it up?

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:02.550
So you really knew.

00:08:03.590 --> 00:08:04.400
Then you

00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:06.670
deserve an even worse fate.

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:08.840
I'll fight you to the end.

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:21.680
Father!

00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:24.880
I will kill you.

00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:37.760
No.

00:08:38.470 --> 00:08:39.230
Don't.

00:08:45.390 --> 00:08:46.070
Wanyan Jin,

00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:47.110
you're awake.

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:50.840
How do you feel?

00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:55.640
Last night, you touched it.

00:08:58.350 --> 00:08:59.310
But now,

00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:01.680
I can't touch it.

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:07.350
Your face...

00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:23.350
It's healed.

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:27.350
Yi,

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:28.520
you've finally arrived.

00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:31.880
You have no idea how much
I've missed you all this time.

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:33.520
Qi,

00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:37.030
why did the one marrying Su Qingran
become the crown prince?

00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:40.000
I was supposed to marry you.

00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:41.560
I even convinced my father

00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:43.390
to marry the eldest daughter
of the Su Family.

00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:46.640
But why did an elder sister
suddenly appear?

00:09:47.110 --> 00:09:49.110
I had to run from the wedding
at the last moment.

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:52.560
That's how Wanyan Jin ended up
marrying your sister instead.

00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:53.800
But don't worry.

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:55.960
Once my father calms down,

00:09:56.350 --> 00:09:57.880
I'll bring up marrying you again.

00:09:58.070 --> 00:09:59.600
So it was all because of you

00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:01.800
that Su Qingran
became the crown princess.

00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:03.720
Qi, you're so thoughtful.

00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:07.070
My sister was trapped
in the countryside since childhood.

00:10:07.270 --> 00:10:09.270
This time she came back,

00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:10.840
she made trouble everywhere.

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:12.720
But...

00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:16.000
Don't you think she looks strikingly
like Wen Yueqian?

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:16.680
Impossible.

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:19.190
She can't possibly be Wen Yueqian.

00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:21.800
At first, I was shocked too.

00:10:22.070 --> 00:10:23.350
But I've already checked.

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:24.560
She's not her.

00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:26.000
Besides,

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:27.850
after she was disfigured and blinded,

00:10:27.850 --> 00:10:29.190
then fell from such a high cliff,

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:30.880
how could she have survived unscathed?

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:33.640
It's just that when I look at her face,

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:35.350
I can't help but feel unsettled.

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:38.960
Let me help ease your mind.

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:41.560
Qi,

00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:43.840
I haven't been feeling well these days.

00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:45.560

Shaoxuan,

00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:00.310
Yunzhou City is way more interesting
than the Capital City.

00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:01.190
It's really fun.

00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:04.600
I think what you like is food.

00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:05.800
You little glutton.

00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:07.780
None of your business.

00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:11.960
What's wrong?

00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:13.350
Later,

00:11:14.010 --> 00:11:15.780
we're going to pay a visit
to Prince Zhenbei.

00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:18.520
But weren't you on an incognito visit?

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:22.000
Plans have changed.

00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:23.030
What plans?

Please.

00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:42.920
So this is the crown princess.

00:11:43.230 --> 00:11:45.880
I heard she burned her face
while cooking in the countryside.

00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:47.760
Half her face was disfigured,

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:48.880
truly unpleasant to look at.

00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:50.230
That's why

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:52.350
she can only show herself behind a veil.

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:55.540
I heard she's arrogant and overbearing.

00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:57.330
She got into a fight
and ruined her own face.

00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:00.100
I think Lady Feiyi is so beautiful,

00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:01.500
and she's also considerate and kind,

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:02.490
polite and well-mannered.
