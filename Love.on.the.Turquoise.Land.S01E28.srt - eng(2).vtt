(This story is a work of fiction)

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.960
=Episode 28=

00:02:35.985 --> 00:02:37.425
This is the Golden Gate.

00:02:50.448 --> 00:02:52.976
The same as what you saw
at the Temple of the Righteous Lord.

00:02:53.584 --> 00:02:55.225
This is the Blade Clan's emblem.

00:02:55.744 --> 00:02:56.825
That's the Whip Clan's.

00:03:01.304 --> 00:03:02.425
And that's Hound Clan's.

00:03:07.385 --> 00:03:08.505
Tighten this.

00:03:10.665 --> 00:03:12.425
Shen, the gear is all ready.

00:03:13.864 --> 00:03:14.545
Go ahead.

00:03:14.825 --> 00:03:15.385
Pretty much.

00:03:17.265 --> 00:03:18.304
You try it first.

00:03:19.464 --> 00:03:20.505
Tighten it.

00:03:23.105 --> 00:03:24.144
Too tight.

00:03:26.744 --> 00:03:27.705
Have a word in private.

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:41.489
We've never been to the Golden Gate.

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.210
No one knows what'll happen next.

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:47.730
It's normal that they feel excited,

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:49.929
anxious, or even scared.

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:52.290
But no matter what,

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:54.650
we can't let them harbor doubts.

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:57.449
Is this a reminder

00:03:58.449 --> 00:03:59.290
or a warning?

00:04:00.337 --> 00:04:01.577
Just a final confirmation.

00:04:02.897 --> 00:04:04.337
Confirm that we share the same goal

00:04:04.777 --> 00:04:05.697
and work together.

00:04:06.738 --> 00:04:07.978
Don't you trust me?

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:09.250
If I don't trust you,

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:11.330
I wouldn't let you lead.

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:14.089
None of us knows what challenges

00:04:14.089 --> 00:04:15.089
lie ahead for us.

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:17.250
I just want to avoid any mishaps.

00:04:24.785 --> 00:04:26.426
Are we opening the Blade Clan's gate?

00:04:29.785 --> 00:04:30.465
Open it then.

00:04:35.785 --> 00:04:38.025
Assemble. Get ready to open the gate.

00:05:08.273 --> 00:05:09.552
Blade, Hound, and Whip Clans

00:05:10.072 --> 00:05:11.913
correspond to
the Golden Gate's three mouths.

00:05:12.592 --> 00:05:14.722
All three mechanisms
must be activated simultaneously.

00:05:16.208 --> 00:05:18.480
Each time, a different
golden figure opens its mouth.

00:05:18.552 --> 00:05:19.552
Only a few Hunters

00:05:19.552 --> 00:05:21.593
know which one will open next.

00:05:22.793 --> 00:05:24.273
If the sequence is correct,

00:05:24.392 --> 00:05:26.153
it proves it's never been opened before.

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:03.376
It's open.

00:06:05.752 --> 00:06:06.713
The entrance's up there.

00:06:06.713 --> 00:06:07.673
Up there.

00:06:25.273 --> 00:06:26.713
Oh, my.

00:06:31.312 --> 00:06:32.192
Sit down.

00:06:40.713 --> 00:06:41.593
Prepare to set off.

00:06:41.776 --> 00:06:42.288
Got it.

00:06:42.913 --> 00:06:43.432
- Go.
- Go.

00:06:45.473 --> 00:06:46.593
- Go.
- Go.

00:06:46.632 --> 00:06:47.432
Let's go.

00:06:48.473 --> 00:06:49.752
- Go.
- Let's go.

00:06:51.473 --> 00:06:53.432
My team, follow me.

00:06:55.872 --> 00:06:56.593
Yu Rong's team,

00:06:57.072 --> 00:06:58.153
depart in thirty minutes.

00:06:58.153 --> 00:06:58.833
No problem.

00:07:15.217 --> 00:07:16.017
Hurry.

00:07:20.938 --> 00:07:21.497
Go inside.

00:07:40.016 --> 00:07:42.480
(Roadsound Mining)

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:50.320
Aren't they going to Twilight Chasm?

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:51.376
Why are they coming here?

00:07:51.376 --> 00:07:52.889
Let's tell Xing Shen about it.

00:07:58.864 --> 00:07:59.753
Jiang.

00:08:01.233 --> 00:08:01.873
Move.

00:08:15.472 --> 00:08:16.993
No. The call can't get through.

00:08:17.272 --> 00:08:18.713
They might get into the Golden Gate.

00:08:18.896 --> 00:08:20.473
We can't wait here. Play it by ear.

00:08:20.496 --> 00:08:21.072
Okay.

00:08:58.833 --> 00:09:00.593
Kid, what are you doing here?

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:10.480
What are you doing here, kid?

00:09:25.191 --> 00:09:25.951
Jiang.

00:09:33.111 --> 00:09:34.111
Why are you here?

00:09:34.929 --> 00:09:35.488
Run!

00:09:37.201 --> 00:09:37.882
Run!

00:09:42.609 --> 00:09:44.930
Either release them all

00:09:45.890 --> 00:09:46.890
and leave.

00:09:47.890 --> 00:09:48.410
Or,

00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:50.650
none of us leaves.

00:09:53.361 --> 00:09:55.680
Kid, are you trying to scare us?

00:09:57.489 --> 00:09:58.328
Want to try?

00:09:59.249 --> 00:10:00.649
We use this to blast mountains.

00:10:01.568 --> 00:10:02.808
Mines are mountains too.

00:10:03.088 --> 00:10:04.009
And they're hollow.

00:10:05.088 --> 00:10:05.849
Explosion

00:10:06.288 --> 00:10:07.249
might be a good idea.

00:10:13.609 --> 00:10:14.408
Ms. Lin, go now.

00:11:07.921 --> 00:11:08.842
Run!

00:12:34.769 --> 00:12:35.608
Tighten this more.

00:12:35.889 --> 00:12:36.448
Alright.

00:12:37.328 --> 00:12:38.192
The waterway's clear.

00:12:38.192 --> 00:12:38.768
No problem.

00:12:38.768 --> 00:12:39.268
This.

00:12:39.268 --> 00:12:39.888
- Okay.
- Tighten it.

00:12:42.129 --> 00:12:43.169
Almost.

00:12:44.649 --> 00:12:45.688
You try it first.

00:12:50.609 --> 00:12:51.369
Are you okay?

00:12:51.489 --> 00:12:52.249
What happened?

00:12:52.249 --> 00:12:52.930
Are you ready?

00:12:53.249 --> 00:12:54.129
The gear and oxygen

00:12:54.369 --> 00:12:55.129
are ready.

00:12:56.330 --> 00:12:57.690
The gate was open when we arrived.

00:12:57.690 --> 00:12:58.489
The lock is broken.

00:12:58.729 --> 00:12:59.930
But the gear is untouched.

00:12:59.930 --> 00:13:00.810
Did anyone go down?

00:13:00.810 --> 00:13:01.609
We've checked. No.

00:13:02.290 --> 00:13:04.009
Good then. Let's gear up and move out.

00:13:04.148 --> 00:13:04.688
Got it.

00:13:20.849 --> 00:13:21.729
Before,

00:13:22.849 --> 00:13:23.930
I was a bit worried

00:13:26.450 --> 00:13:27.729
that with the passage of time,

00:13:28.650 --> 00:13:31.570
the South Mountain Hunters
had lost cohesion

00:13:32.210 --> 00:13:33.249
and with no successors.

00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:37.769
But now seeing this kid

00:13:38.930 --> 00:13:40.210
so capable and brave.

00:13:43.410 --> 00:13:45.489
You wicked birds

00:13:45.729 --> 00:13:46.690
won't overturn anything.

00:13:54.050 --> 00:13:54.729
Xiong Hei.

00:13:56.170 --> 00:13:56.720
Xiong Hei.

00:13:59.889 --> 00:14:01.729
Young ones shoulder heavy duties.

00:14:02.009 --> 00:14:04.129
Veterans face death unflinchingly.

00:14:05.889 --> 00:14:06.609
Since you Hunters

00:14:06.609 --> 00:14:08.889
have resolved to die,

00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:11.969
once we reach Twilight Chasm,

00:14:13.129 --> 00:14:16.650
I'll send you all to death peacefully.

00:14:18.369 --> 00:14:19.489
Can't wait any longer.

00:14:20.785 --> 00:14:22.104
Everyone in diving suits?

00:14:22.464 --> 00:14:23.425
Check the tanks.

00:15:08.241 --> 00:15:08.848
Let's go.

00:16:12.882 --> 00:16:13.840
Big Head, Shan Qiang.

00:16:14.882 --> 00:16:16.401
Help me get Jiang down.

00:16:17.241 --> 00:16:18.282
Everyone else, stay sharp!

00:16:36.362 --> 00:16:37.362
Ambush!

00:16:37.961 --> 00:16:38.721
Ambush!

00:16:39.921 --> 00:16:40.441
Who's there?

00:17:10.562 --> 00:17:11.522
Hound Clan, follow me.

00:17:11.882 --> 00:17:13.282
Third, guard the Earth Fiends.

00:17:13.401 --> 00:17:14.602
Shan Qiang, pin them down.

00:17:50.769 --> 00:17:52.608
Hound Clan, report.

00:17:55.288 --> 00:17:56.368
Fiend stench is thickening.

00:18:35.857 --> 00:18:37.176
Dacheng!

00:18:42.216 --> 00:18:43.656
Xiaoyu!

00:18:47.089 --> 00:18:48.089
They're Xiong Hei's men.

00:18:48.289 --> 00:18:49.329
Treated by Lv Xian before.

00:18:59.984 --> 00:19:00.720
Where's Mao Liang?

00:19:01.408 --> 00:19:02.089
Mao Liang!

00:19:02.768 --> 00:19:03.849
- Mao Liang!
- Mao Liang!

00:19:05.928 --> 00:19:07.248
He was right behind me.

00:19:09.408 --> 00:19:09.968
Mao Liang.

00:19:12.529 --> 00:19:13.089
Mao Liang!

00:19:17.688 --> 00:19:18.488
What is that?

00:19:20.488 --> 00:19:21.289
Keep the formation!

00:19:39.049 --> 00:19:39.649
Over there.

00:19:44.728 --> 00:19:45.329
Scatter!

00:20:28.569 --> 00:20:30.889
This is the Whip Clan's move.

00:21:14.728 --> 00:21:15.289
Watch out!

00:21:23.008 --> 00:21:23.609
Grab this!

00:21:49.208 --> 00:21:49.728
Luo!

00:21:55.049 --> 00:21:56.049
Hold tight!

00:21:57.488 --> 00:21:58.569
Hold tight!

00:22:00.529 --> 00:22:01.529
Hold tight!

00:22:03.008 --> 00:22:04.289
Take care.

00:22:05.129 --> 00:22:05.928
Sun Li!

00:22:15.569 --> 00:22:16.289
Yan Tuo.

00:22:22.529 --> 00:22:23.448
Miss Nie.

00:22:25.129 --> 00:22:27.408
No, Mad Blade.

00:22:28.488 --> 00:22:29.569
I think between us,

00:22:29.728 --> 00:22:31.408
no need for formalities.

00:23:08.817 --> 00:23:10.657
I wish you were Mad Blade,

00:23:11.458 --> 00:23:13.018
so you could give me a clean death.

00:23:24.337 --> 00:23:26.577
What are those white-haired creatures?

00:23:27.313 --> 00:23:28.273
We wounded

00:23:29.474 --> 00:23:31.474
those South Mountain Hunters

00:23:31.714 --> 00:23:32.914
who opposed us.

00:23:34.154 --> 00:23:36.113
They had no time to kindle natural fire

00:23:37.154 --> 00:23:38.313
to heal their wounds,

00:23:39.194 --> 00:23:41.234
so they locked themselves in here

00:23:42.313 --> 00:23:43.914
turning into Earth Demons.

00:23:45.434 --> 00:23:47.073
Then continue fighting us.

00:23:48.593 --> 00:23:50.154
They keep haunting us.

00:23:50.769 --> 00:23:51.688
Earth Demons?

00:23:52.369 --> 00:23:53.330
Normally,

00:23:54.209 --> 00:23:56.610
they don't pop up for no reason

00:23:56.610 --> 00:23:57.889
to massacre.

00:23:59.330 --> 00:24:00.570
It's you guys.

00:24:01.290 --> 00:24:02.409
You guys did it.

00:24:42.513 --> 00:24:43.592
Someone has been here.

00:25:10.257 --> 00:25:10.898
Who's there?

00:25:17.969 --> 00:25:19.008
I saw you.

00:25:19.008 --> 00:25:19.689
Show yourself.

00:25:30.417 --> 00:25:31.256
Jiang.

00:25:31.897 --> 00:25:32.538
Jiang.

00:25:32.785 --> 00:25:33.466
Stay back!

00:25:36.265 --> 00:25:36.946
Stay back.

00:25:38.345 --> 00:25:39.105
Jiang.

00:26:17.105 --> 00:26:18.384
You're a South Mountain Hunter?

00:26:20.184 --> 00:26:21.664
We're South Mountain Hunters as well.

00:26:23.944 --> 00:26:25.184
Don't waste your time.

00:26:25.585 --> 00:26:27.305
They've lost consciousness long ago.

00:26:28.424 --> 00:26:30.424
Even Earth Fiends can't handle it.

00:26:30.984 --> 00:26:32.944
Let alone a rookie like you.

00:26:37.345 --> 00:26:38.865
When you were confined at home,

00:26:40.144 --> 00:26:41.585
I brought you a razor.

00:26:42.384 --> 00:26:43.785
When you were trapped in the mine,

00:26:44.144 --> 00:26:45.464
I brought you tangerines.

00:26:45.984 --> 00:26:48.025
You owe me all these.

00:26:49.384 --> 00:26:50.825
I suggest you leave now

00:26:53.025 --> 00:26:55.305
before I kill you.

00:27:20.105 --> 00:27:20.984
Stop chasing.

00:27:25.521 --> 00:27:26.601
Summon them out now.

00:27:33.001 --> 00:27:34.162
What is this?

00:27:37.402 --> 00:27:38.281
Don't you think?

00:27:39.056 --> 00:27:40.688
The deeper we go into
the Twilight Chasm,

00:27:41.442 --> 00:27:43.801
this place feels more like
a giant living creature.

00:27:47.801 --> 00:27:49.001
I feel this path

00:27:49.321 --> 00:27:50.642
pulsates occasionally.

00:27:52.801 --> 00:27:55.722
Great then.
Living creatures fear this the most.

00:28:03.521 --> 00:28:04.202
Jiang.

00:28:04.761 --> 00:28:06.642
Forget the red thread piercing pupils.

00:28:07.162 --> 00:28:08.162
Let's go back first.

00:28:08.162 --> 00:28:09.241
There must be a way.

00:28:11.122 --> 00:28:12.321
Yu Rong, am I right?

00:28:12.977 --> 00:28:14.576
There must be a way, right?

00:28:15.537 --> 00:28:17.136
Ahead. There's an exit ahead.

00:28:18.457 --> 00:28:20.496
It's like a maze in here.

00:28:20.496 --> 00:28:21.176
Easy to get lost.

00:28:21.176 --> 00:28:21.648
Yu Rong.

00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:23.120
Quecha.

00:28:36.945 --> 00:28:37.865
Jiang.

00:28:39.425 --> 00:28:40.264
Stay back.

00:28:52.017 --> 00:28:52.658
Jiang.

00:28:54.768 --> 00:28:55.280
Jiang...

00:29:11.618 --> 00:29:12.618
I presume

00:29:13.937 --> 00:29:15.138
you've all come here

00:29:15.697 --> 00:29:18.058
to rescue me and the four others.

00:29:19.017 --> 00:29:19.977
But now,

00:29:21.138 --> 00:29:22.537
they're probably gone.

00:29:23.777 --> 00:29:26.618
And my pupils are pierced
by the red thread, so I can't leave.

00:29:27.777 --> 00:29:28.537
Therefore,

00:29:29.217 --> 00:29:30.058
your mission

00:29:30.898 --> 00:29:32.338
has been completed.

00:29:35.497 --> 00:29:36.777
The white-haired ones

00:29:37.497 --> 00:29:38.697
must be former

00:29:39.818 --> 00:29:42.257
South Mountain Hunters
whose pupils pierced by red thread.

00:29:42.578 --> 00:29:44.898
They exiled themselves
in the Golden Gate.

00:29:46.578 --> 00:29:47.457
Never expected

00:29:49.017 --> 00:29:50.418
they'd become like that.

00:29:51.898 --> 00:29:55.497
Fate brings me here today.

00:29:56.658 --> 00:29:58.297
I upheld South Mountain's rules

00:29:59.178 --> 00:30:02.098
and joined my predecessors.

00:30:02.898 --> 00:30:06.377
Though I can't return with you,

00:30:07.658 --> 00:30:08.817
this still counts as

00:30:10.448 --> 00:30:12.144
returning to the South Mountain Hunters.

00:30:16.217 --> 00:30:17.658
What a fine end!

00:30:20.618 --> 00:30:21.538
Besides,

00:30:24.538 --> 00:30:26.377
I can see you all here.

00:30:29.458 --> 00:30:30.417
I'm already content.

00:30:43.897 --> 00:30:44.618
Mad Dog,

00:30:49.978 --> 00:30:50.777
Ghost Whip,

00:30:58.257 --> 00:30:59.377
Mad Blade.

00:31:12.618 --> 00:31:13.777
Take a headcount

00:31:14.697 --> 00:31:16.417
and evacuate everyone.

00:31:18.297 --> 00:31:19.737
No negotiations this time.

00:31:21.817 --> 00:31:23.297
You must follow my orders.

00:32:34.217 --> 00:32:35.098
What's that sound?

00:32:37.817 --> 00:32:38.538
I smell fiends.

00:32:46.978 --> 00:32:47.697
Yan Tuo.

00:32:50.938 --> 00:32:51.538
Luo.

00:32:52.458 --> 00:32:53.098
Luo.

00:32:53.098 --> 00:32:54.938
Yan Tuo, are you okay?

00:32:54.938 --> 00:32:55.777
I'm fine.

00:33:36.658 --> 00:33:37.737
Push the statues over.

00:33:39.217 --> 00:33:40.058
Hurry!

00:33:40.938 --> 00:33:41.488
Hurry!

00:34:25.777 --> 00:34:26.697
Faster!

00:34:26.697 --> 00:34:28.058
More Earth Fiends are coming.

00:34:44.857 --> 00:34:46.658
Third, cut through the membrane.

00:34:46.658 --> 00:34:47.458
Got it!

00:35:51.138 --> 00:35:51.658
Luo.

00:35:58.817 --> 00:35:59.618
Guo!

00:36:01.337 --> 00:36:03.817
- Guo!
- Guo!

00:36:06.138 --> 00:36:06.777
Hurry!

When life hangs by a thread,
you're on your own.

00:38:13.296 --> 00:38:15.472
If you've got one breath left,

00:38:15.472 --> 00:38:17.040
make it kill.
