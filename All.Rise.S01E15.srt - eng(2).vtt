00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.640
(Jiang Chen 3, Yan Fei 2, Ren Jiatong 1)

00:01:56.872 --> 00:01:58.792
Yue, I thought you were getting married

00:01:58.872 --> 00:02:00.312
at the end of the year.

00:02:00.673 --> 00:02:01.673
And even if you do,

00:02:01.673 --> 00:02:02.872
you don't need to leave.

00:02:03.312 --> 00:02:04.393
Why are you doing this?

00:02:05.152 --> 00:02:06.152
Isn't it good?

00:02:06.673 --> 00:02:07.753
If I didn't leave,

00:02:07.952 --> 00:02:09.353
you'd be the one eliminated.

00:02:11.833 --> 00:02:12.393
Just kidding.

00:02:13.233 --> 00:02:15.353
At least one of us should stay.

00:02:15.553 --> 00:02:16.553
Do your best.

00:02:19.673 --> 00:02:20.553
Actually,

00:02:20.673 --> 00:02:21.793
I've never been someone

00:02:21.793 --> 00:02:23.152
who likes quitting halfway.

00:02:23.632 --> 00:02:24.993
I didn't want to leave.

00:02:25.712 --> 00:02:26.673
But

00:02:27.673 --> 00:02:28.993
he's being assigned overseas

00:02:29.273 --> 00:02:30.673
and wants me to go with him.

00:02:31.673 --> 00:02:33.393
I thought it over.

00:02:33.953 --> 00:02:35.432
I value this relationship.

00:02:35.953 --> 00:02:36.833
The thought of

00:02:36.912 --> 00:02:37.953
losing it scares me.

00:02:38.553 --> 00:02:40.073
I don't want to take risks.

00:02:41.152 --> 00:02:41.833
I understand.

00:02:42.632 --> 00:02:43.752
It's just very sudden.

00:02:43.752 --> 00:02:45.432
You didn't even tell me last night.

00:02:46.192 --> 00:02:48.513
I felt a bit embarrassed.

00:02:49.233 --> 00:02:49.912
Think about it.

00:02:50.353 --> 00:02:51.553
I took so many exams

00:02:51.553 --> 00:02:52.673
and studied so much

00:02:52.953 --> 00:02:54.152
at home and abroad,

00:02:54.912 --> 00:02:57.393
only to give up and quit the job.

00:02:58.032 --> 00:02:59.393
It just feels kind of...

00:03:01.953 --> 00:03:02.993
But honestly,

00:03:03.553 --> 00:03:04.953
you and Zhu Zhisheng

00:03:05.312 --> 00:03:06.553
and Ms. Bai and Mr. Song

00:03:06.872 --> 00:03:08.353
really affected me a lot.

00:03:09.312 --> 00:03:10.233
I'm just

00:03:10.673 --> 00:03:11.592
a bit scared.

00:03:12.032 --> 00:03:13.833
I'm not sure what truly matters.

00:03:14.752 --> 00:03:15.513
I'm afraid

00:03:16.312 --> 00:03:18.752
that I might lose
the person I love someday.

00:03:19.953 --> 00:03:20.353
I get it.

00:03:21.432 --> 00:03:23.353
If you know what you want,

00:03:23.752 --> 00:03:24.993
feel free to hold onto it

00:03:25.312 --> 00:03:25.793
tightly.

00:03:26.192 --> 00:03:27.312
Making choices

00:03:28.032 --> 00:03:30.312
isn't as hard as admitting our desires.

00:03:31.632 --> 00:03:32.073
Yue,

00:03:32.912 --> 00:03:33.673
you're brave.

00:03:41.896 --> 00:03:43.176
(Civil Code
of the People's Republic of China)

00:03:47.187 --> 00:03:48.904
(Huang Yue)

00:03:52.793 --> 00:03:54.712
Honestly, I've always admired you guys.

00:03:55.312 --> 00:03:56.953
But at Jun An, we could only

00:03:57.312 --> 00:03:59.073
be competitors instead of friends.

00:03:59.592 --> 00:04:01.432
But now the competition is over.

00:04:01.752 --> 00:04:04.113
Maybe we can finally be friends.

00:04:05.032 --> 00:04:05.553
Of course.

00:04:07.592 --> 00:04:08.712
Don't get so sentimental.

00:04:08.953 --> 00:04:09.953
We're all in Beijing.

00:04:10.393 --> 00:04:11.353
Let's hang out.

00:04:12.592 --> 00:04:13.953
Everyone's so busy,

00:04:14.032 --> 00:04:14.953
and Beijing is huge.

00:04:15.273 --> 00:04:16.153
"Let's hang out."

00:04:16.153 --> 00:04:16.832
"Next time."

00:04:16.832 --> 00:04:18.392
We always say that,

00:04:18.593 --> 00:04:19.832
but we rarely follow through.

00:04:21.632 --> 00:04:22.913
I don't want pleasantries.

00:04:23.312 --> 00:04:24.312
I want to speak my mind.

00:04:24.993 --> 00:04:27.072
I don't have many friends.

00:04:27.432 --> 00:04:29.793
I truly like all three of you.

00:04:30.353 --> 00:04:32.153
I'd like you to be my bridesmaids

00:04:32.392 --> 00:04:33.832
at the end of the year

00:04:34.392 --> 00:04:36.033
when my boyfriend comes back.

00:04:36.713 --> 00:04:37.153
Will you?

00:04:40.632 --> 00:04:41.832
You won't?

00:04:42.272 --> 00:04:42.952
- We will.
- We will.

00:04:45.473 --> 00:04:48.033
And Xiaoyu took me to your meeting spot,

00:04:48.153 --> 00:04:48.952
you know,

00:04:48.952 --> 00:04:49.952
that noodle shop.

00:04:50.593 --> 00:04:52.593
Now it's my second-favorite place

00:04:52.593 --> 00:04:53.593
in Beijing.

00:04:54.072 --> 00:04:55.473
What's your favorite place?

00:04:59.233 --> 00:05:00.153
Jun An, of course.

00:05:04.512 --> 00:05:06.993
Let's throw her a farewell party.

00:05:07.632 --> 00:05:08.272
Don't.

00:05:08.832 --> 00:05:10.432
It was the farewell party last night.

00:05:10.553 --> 00:05:11.752
I had a great time.

00:05:12.113 --> 00:05:13.832
I didn't tell you then because

00:05:14.233 --> 00:05:15.392
I don't like sad goodbyes.

00:05:21.153 --> 00:05:21.593
Huang Yue.

00:05:23.272 --> 00:05:24.424
Are you sure about this?

00:05:28.632 --> 00:05:30.512
Actually, every time I work late

00:05:31.233 --> 00:05:32.832
and look at the city lights outside,

00:05:33.353 --> 00:05:34.392
I tell myself

00:05:34.793 --> 00:05:36.432
to stick it out at Jun An.

00:05:37.153 --> 00:05:39.233
Meanwhile, I can't help wondering

00:05:39.832 --> 00:05:41.272
whether I could have a share

00:05:41.593 --> 00:05:43.113
of the happiness behind those lights.

00:05:43.993 --> 00:05:44.872
Honestly,

00:05:45.432 --> 00:05:46.713
I'm not so sure about this.

00:05:47.353 --> 00:05:48.233
I'm simply choosing

00:05:48.233 --> 00:05:49.952
the more important

00:05:50.512 --> 00:05:51.713
of the two options.

00:05:52.993 --> 00:05:53.752
I hope you could

00:05:54.512 --> 00:05:55.153
stick with

00:05:55.153 --> 00:05:56.512
what is more important to you.

00:06:02.673 --> 00:06:03.113
You'll

00:06:04.392 --> 00:06:05.153
find happiness.

00:06:11.713 --> 00:06:12.840
Thanks for walking me out.

00:06:14.952 --> 00:06:15.392
No problem.

00:06:16.033 --> 00:06:17.033
You won't let us,

00:06:17.033 --> 00:06:19.072
but someone has to carry your stuff.

00:06:19.872 --> 00:06:20.713
But to be honest,

00:06:20.993 --> 00:06:21.913
I never expected

00:06:21.913 --> 00:06:23.153
you'd make this decision.

00:06:23.832 --> 00:06:24.832
You're the one who

00:06:25.353 --> 00:06:26.233
reminded me that

00:06:26.593 --> 00:06:28.272
no one seems to escape this curse.

00:06:28.952 --> 00:06:30.233
If you prioritize your career,

00:06:30.233 --> 00:06:31.473
love becomes unattainable.

00:06:31.832 --> 00:06:32.272
It proves

00:06:32.713 --> 00:06:33.713
true with Guo Xiaoyu,

00:06:33.713 --> 00:06:34.832
and Ms. Bai and Mr. Song.

00:06:35.353 --> 00:06:36.033
Since fate

00:06:36.033 --> 00:06:37.392
is hinting at me plainly,

00:06:37.913 --> 00:06:38.952
I heed the warning.

00:06:39.832 --> 00:06:41.353
It was just an offhand remark.

00:06:41.353 --> 00:06:42.153
Why did you

00:06:42.632 --> 00:06:43.832
take it seriously?

00:06:43.832 --> 00:06:44.872
Don't try to console me.

00:06:45.512 --> 00:06:46.553
Honestly, I'm not sure

00:06:46.553 --> 00:06:47.832
if this is the right move.

00:06:48.312 --> 00:06:49.752
But that's what I want for now.

00:06:50.473 --> 00:06:51.553
I wish you happiness.

00:06:52.233 --> 00:06:52.593
Thanks.

00:06:52.793 --> 00:06:53.384
Same to you.

00:06:54.632 --> 00:06:55.473
Actually, I know

00:06:56.033 --> 00:06:57.593
you understand women so well

00:06:57.832 --> 00:06:59.272
because you have a great sister.

00:06:59.913 --> 00:07:01.233
You're striving to stay

00:07:01.392 --> 00:07:02.473
because of her, right?

00:07:04.593 --> 00:07:05.713
My sister has always

00:07:05.713 --> 00:07:07.473
encouraged and trusted me
unconditionally.

00:07:08.233 --> 00:07:08.952
Even now,

00:07:08.952 --> 00:07:10.473
she's the only one in my family

00:07:10.473 --> 00:07:12.033
who believes I'll make it at Jun An.

00:07:13.353 --> 00:07:14.713
Now, she and my niece

00:07:15.392 --> 00:07:16.473
are my emotional anchor.

00:07:16.952 --> 00:07:18.153
Just thinking of them

00:07:18.353 --> 00:07:19.713
fills me with unstoppable drive.

00:07:21.233 --> 00:07:23.153
But sometimes too much expectation

00:07:23.272 --> 00:07:24.713
can bring crushing pressure.

00:07:25.353 --> 00:07:26.392
You should try to

00:07:26.593 --> 00:07:28.033
prioritize your own feelings.

00:07:33.673 --> 00:07:35.713
I heard Huang Yue's
mystery boyfriend is loaded.

00:07:36.832 --> 00:07:38.793
She will live a cozy life.

00:07:39.512 --> 00:07:41.072
But betting your whole future

00:07:41.072 --> 00:07:42.713
on some rich guy

00:07:43.353 --> 00:07:44.432
isn't always secure.

00:07:45.312 --> 00:07:46.072
Think about my mom.

00:07:56.153 --> 00:07:56.872
I'm fine.

00:08:01.713 --> 00:08:03.593
Still, I support Huang Yue.

00:08:04.952 --> 00:08:06.473
Everyone charts their own path.

00:08:08.033 --> 00:08:10.793
Greed or hesitation, even for a moment,

00:08:12.192 --> 00:08:13.473
can cost you someone important.

00:08:20.913 --> 00:08:21.713
Guo Xiaoyu.

00:08:24.272 --> 00:08:25.033
I'm hungry.

00:08:29.593 --> 00:08:30.793
I want some noodles.

00:08:31.673 --> 00:08:33.713
You had dinner two hours ago.

00:08:33.993 --> 00:08:35.113
Then you had chips

00:08:35.113 --> 00:08:36.313
and a yogurt.

00:08:36.713 --> 00:08:37.912
I'm still growing.

00:08:37.912 --> 00:08:39.073
Just make me some noodles.

00:08:39.713 --> 00:08:41.073
I'm too tired to go out.

00:08:42.313 --> 00:08:42.792
Jiatong,

00:08:43.473 --> 00:08:45.833
since when do you
give people puppy eyes?

00:08:46.993 --> 00:08:49.193
Help, I'm posting this on Moments now.

00:08:49.953 --> 00:08:51.473
Roast me all you want.

00:08:52.113 --> 00:08:54.193
Just cook me some noodles.

00:08:54.473 --> 00:08:55.593
I'm starving.

00:08:55.593 --> 00:08:58.152
Alright.

00:08:59.193 --> 00:09:00.473
How are you still "growing"?

00:09:00.713 --> 00:09:02.193
I never knew you could eat so much.

00:09:04.433 --> 00:09:05.713
What'll you do without me?

00:09:07.113 --> 00:09:07.713
Two eggs, okay?

00:09:18.515 --> 00:09:20.648
(Yan Fei)

00:09:23.392 --> 00:09:23.872
Hello.

00:09:24.833 --> 00:09:25.713
Why does it

00:09:25.713 --> 00:09:28.073
sound like you hate to answer my call?

00:09:28.473 --> 00:09:29.593
Waiting for someone else?

00:09:30.353 --> 00:09:31.272
I'm always on standby

00:09:31.272 --> 00:09:32.672
for Miss Yan's command.

00:09:33.632 --> 00:09:35.272
I just saw Xiaoyu's Moment,

00:09:35.272 --> 00:09:37.152
saying her roommate was exploiting her.

00:09:37.233 --> 00:09:38.752
I was gearing up to play hero.

00:09:39.392 --> 00:09:40.593
Guess that's unnecessary.

00:09:40.872 --> 00:09:42.912
She's humming away in the kitchen,

00:09:42.912 --> 00:09:44.152
making noodles.

00:09:44.512 --> 00:09:45.152
Pretty cute.

00:09:46.993 --> 00:09:49.752
So who do you think is cuter, me or her?

00:09:49.993 --> 00:09:51.872
Jealousy isn't a good look.

00:09:54.833 --> 00:09:56.353
You asked Guo Xiaoyu for noodles

00:09:56.512 --> 00:09:57.752
to show her

00:09:57.912 --> 00:09:59.392
that she's needed, right?

00:10:00.152 --> 00:10:01.632
I'm really getting to know you.

00:10:03.152 --> 00:10:04.792
Tell her that I want noodles too.

00:10:05.993 --> 00:10:06.872
Noodles are ready.

00:10:07.713 --> 00:10:08.313
Coming.

00:10:16.233 --> 00:10:17.752
You're even better at making noodles

00:10:17.993 --> 00:10:19.672
after you came back from Hangzhou.

00:10:19.993 --> 00:10:20.632
Really?

00:10:20.912 --> 00:10:21.473
Let me try.

00:10:30.632 --> 00:10:31.392
It's just alright.

00:10:32.073 --> 00:10:32.993
It's really good.

00:10:33.552 --> 00:10:34.152
I don't care.

00:10:34.152 --> 00:10:36.272
You'll cook for me
whenever I crave noodles.

00:10:38.152 --> 00:10:39.193
Got it.

00:10:40.113 --> 00:10:41.032
I'd cook for you

00:10:41.032 --> 00:10:42.392
even if you don't praise me.

00:10:46.344 --> 00:10:47.593
(Is it a good time to talk?)

00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:57.636
(I'm having noodles with Jiatong.
What's wrong?)

00:11:01.832 --> 00:11:03.656
(I got a project from Mr. Zhou.)

00:11:03.656 --> 00:11:04.616
(Let's do it together.)

00:11:04.808 --> 00:11:06.280
(But keep it confidential for now.)

00:11:13.256 --> 00:11:16.840
(You mean, I can't even tell Jiatong?)

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:19.048
(Preferably not. Huang Yue left.)

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:20.887
(We're left at the bottom.)

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:25.384
(We need to achieve something
to prove ourselves.)

00:11:27.976 --> 00:11:29.064
(Okay.)

00:11:33.233 --> 00:11:33.752
What's wrong?

00:11:34.632 --> 00:11:35.152
Nothing.

00:11:36.993 --> 00:11:37.353
Jiatong.

00:11:37.792 --> 00:11:38.872
Be straight with me.

00:11:39.833 --> 00:11:41.113
Something was wrong with you

00:11:41.113 --> 00:11:42.353
before I went to Hangzhou.

00:11:43.233 --> 00:11:44.433
Was it

00:11:46.073 --> 00:11:47.073
Jiang Chen?

00:11:47.272 --> 00:11:48.272
Don't talk nonsense.

00:11:48.512 --> 00:11:49.953
I'm not talking nonsense.

00:11:50.152 --> 00:11:51.792
Today, he asked me whether

00:11:52.392 --> 00:11:54.593
the streetlights
at our neighborhood entrance

00:11:54.593 --> 00:11:56.953
had been fixed.

00:11:57.512 --> 00:11:58.032
See?

00:11:58.272 --> 00:12:00.512
He asks these
weirdly specific questions.

00:12:00.552 --> 00:12:01.632
Nothing's going on.

00:12:02.792 --> 00:12:03.672
Promise me that

00:12:03.833 --> 00:12:04.993
nothing's going on.

00:12:05.593 --> 00:12:06.672
I don't want you to go.

00:12:06.993 --> 00:12:07.833
I promise.

00:12:11.233 --> 00:12:12.152
I promise

00:12:12.152 --> 00:12:13.272
we are just colleagues.

00:12:14.152 --> 00:12:15.272
Why would I leave though?

00:12:15.993 --> 00:12:16.672
Good to know.

00:12:17.872 --> 00:12:19.473
But if something happens,

00:12:22.032 --> 00:12:22.752
you must tell me.

00:12:23.512 --> 00:12:24.272
I'll help you.

00:12:27.993 --> 00:12:28.672
You know?

00:12:28.912 --> 00:12:29.872
Yue told me

00:12:30.272 --> 00:12:31.872
about Ms. Bai and Mr. Song.

00:12:32.593 --> 00:12:33.632
It's devastating.

00:12:34.593 --> 00:12:36.032
What about Ms. Bai and Mr. Song?

00:12:36.792 --> 00:12:37.512
You didn't know?

00:12:39.113 --> 00:12:40.993
They were actually dating,

00:12:41.792 --> 00:12:43.272
but workplace relationships

00:12:43.272 --> 00:12:44.152
were forbidden.

00:12:44.392 --> 00:12:45.233
Mr. Song hesitated.

00:12:45.792 --> 00:12:46.392
He didn't know

00:12:46.392 --> 00:12:47.152
Ms. Bai had

00:12:47.152 --> 00:12:48.392
already joined another firm.

00:12:49.632 --> 00:12:51.512
So Mr. Song regretted his decision.

00:12:52.152 --> 00:12:53.233
Years later,

00:12:53.632 --> 00:12:54.512
Ms. Bai returned.

00:12:54.872 --> 00:12:55.792
But they could never

00:12:56.872 --> 00:12:58.512
get back with each other.

00:12:58.872 --> 00:12:59.993
Things have changed.

00:13:00.872 --> 00:13:01.272
Sad, huh?

00:13:01.993 --> 00:13:03.872
Mr. Song is still single to this day.

00:13:04.632 --> 00:13:05.792
Why did Ms. Bai leave?

00:13:05.792 --> 00:13:06.752
I'd never have left.

00:13:06.993 --> 00:13:08.152
Exactly.

00:13:08.152 --> 00:13:09.113
I wouldn't have, either.

00:13:10.272 --> 00:13:11.152
From now on,

00:13:11.632 --> 00:13:12.713
I'm renouncing romance.

00:13:13.272 --> 00:13:13.993
No love,

00:13:14.473 --> 00:13:16.512
no relationships,

00:13:16.632 --> 00:13:17.473
only my career.

00:13:19.872 --> 00:13:20.272
Anyway.

00:13:20.752 --> 00:13:21.272
Back to work.

00:13:27.593 --> 00:13:28.152
Work hard.

00:13:28.632 --> 00:13:29.233
Okay.

00:13:42.512 --> 00:13:44.272
Yan Fei, Xiaoyu, lunch?

00:13:44.433 --> 00:13:44.792
Sure.

00:13:45.752 --> 00:13:47.313
Let me finish this first.

00:13:48.512 --> 00:13:48.993
I'll wait.

00:13:51.272 --> 00:13:53.672
You used to be our top foodie.

00:13:53.993 --> 00:13:56.272
Your motto was
"Full stomach fuels productivity."

00:13:56.752 --> 00:13:58.233
Look how much you've changed.

00:13:58.392 --> 00:13:59.993
Are you still my "little rain drop"?

00:14:00.512 --> 00:14:01.672
No, I'm not.

00:14:01.872 --> 00:14:02.993
I'm a "storm" now.

00:14:03.193 --> 00:14:04.353
I'll outwork everyone.

00:14:05.032 --> 00:14:06.353
Not bad.

00:14:08.912 --> 00:14:09.608
Ren Jiatong,

00:14:09.912 --> 00:14:10.752
let's grab lunch.

00:14:10.912 --> 00:14:12.032
I need to talk to you.

00:14:13.152 --> 00:14:14.032
I'm bored since

00:14:14.032 --> 00:14:14.953
Xiaoyu isn't going.

00:14:15.073 --> 00:14:16.193
I'll have some snacks.

00:14:24.912 --> 00:14:25.672
Nothing urgent,

00:14:25.792 --> 00:14:26.473
right?

00:14:26.672 --> 00:14:28.233
I'm in the middle of something.

00:14:37.949 --> 00:14:42.856
(Jiang Chen:
I really need to talk to you.)

00:14:42.856 --> 00:14:45.800
(Ren Jiatong: Okay. Let's talk later.)

00:15:38.552 --> 00:15:38.872
Okay.

00:16:07.912 --> 00:16:09.272
The area up ahead

00:16:09.272 --> 00:16:10.433
is our intern zone.

00:16:10.552 --> 00:16:11.632
These are the candidates

00:16:12.193 --> 00:16:13.288
of the Talent Hunt Program.

00:16:17.713 --> 00:16:19.833
Already eyeing someone else?

00:16:20.353 --> 00:16:22.672
I've had my eyes on him for a while.

00:16:23.113 --> 00:16:24.953
He's even better-looking in person.

00:16:26.872 --> 00:16:27.353
Xiaoyu.

00:16:29.193 --> 00:16:29.768
Who is he?

00:16:34.653 --> 00:16:37.704
(A talented game producer.)

00:16:37.992 --> 00:16:38.984
(From Tian Kai Xin.)

00:16:38.984 --> 00:16:41.448
(Wang Yinggao. Baidu Encyclopedia.)

00:16:42.088 --> 00:16:43.496
(Looks impressive.)

00:16:45.576 --> 00:16:48.424
(I've played all their games.
Legendary stuff.)

00:16:49.672 --> 00:16:51.977
(But why are they here?)

00:16:55.464 --> 00:16:57.896
(Isn't it obvious? New client.)

00:17:05.597 --> 00:17:11.821
(Tian Kai Xin)

00:17:12.477 --> 00:17:14.792
(Tian Kai Xin. Tianyancha.)

00:17:14.792 --> 00:17:21.902
(Yingtai advises Tian Kai Xin Games Tech
on its Hong Kong, China IPO.)

00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:31.112
(Your firm worked
on Tian Kai Xin's IPO?)

00:17:35.048 --> 00:17:37.925
(Yeah, but it's a long story.)

00:17:42.408 --> 00:17:45.288
(Bubble tea on me. Let's talk.)

00:17:49.512 --> 00:17:51.473
Li Ke, good job on
the cross-examination opinion.

00:17:51.993 --> 00:17:52.633
Thank you.

00:17:52.993 --> 00:17:53.832
You did it alone

00:17:54.032 --> 00:17:55.873
so fast amid such a heavy workload.

00:17:55.993 --> 00:17:56.792
Very efficient.

00:17:56.993 --> 00:17:58.233
The opinion on

00:17:58.233 --> 00:17:59.352
their second set of evidence

00:17:59.873 --> 00:18:00.873
is brilliant.

00:18:01.393 --> 00:18:02.112
I didn't need to

00:18:02.112 --> 00:18:03.153
make any changes.

00:18:03.792 --> 00:18:04.792
Just doing my job.

00:18:07.792 --> 00:18:08.112
Mr...

00:18:21.153 --> 00:18:22.832
You've been acting mysterious all day.

00:18:23.072 --> 00:18:23.873
What happened?

00:18:26.473 --> 00:18:28.473
I'm the one who wrote that opinion.

00:18:29.832 --> 00:18:32.153
Keep it down.
Mr. Song's office door is open.

00:18:34.673 --> 00:18:36.433
I sent it to Li Ke right away

00:18:36.792 --> 00:18:38.153
to be compiled and handed in.

00:18:38.312 --> 00:18:39.873
But Mr. Zhou thought he did it alone.

00:18:44.153 --> 00:18:44.913
Let's talk at home.

00:18:49.873 --> 00:18:51.032
Calm down.

00:18:51.032 --> 00:18:52.433
Anger won't solve anything.

00:18:53.473 --> 00:18:55.673
Do you still have the chat history?

00:18:55.832 --> 00:18:57.288
Let's talk to Mr. Zhou tomorrow.

00:18:58.312 --> 00:18:59.144
I came around it.

00:18:59.552 --> 00:19:00.393
I'm fine now.

00:19:01.473 --> 00:19:02.913
You were right to stop me earlier.

00:19:03.473 --> 00:19:05.032
If I'd actually stormed over

00:19:05.552 --> 00:19:07.913
to ask Mr. Zhou
and Mr. Song to do me justice,

00:19:08.633 --> 00:19:10.352
and got overheard by the client,

00:19:10.873 --> 00:19:12.473
it would've damaged Jun An's image.

00:19:12.673 --> 00:19:13.072
Right?

00:19:13.913 --> 00:19:15.592
Even though Mr. Zhou and Mr. Song

00:19:15.592 --> 00:19:17.312
are excellent mentors,

00:19:17.592 --> 00:19:19.352
they're still management in the end.

00:19:19.832 --> 00:19:22.193
They value the results most.

00:19:22.393 --> 00:19:23.832
They don't have the time

00:19:24.072 --> 00:19:25.352
to mediate disputes

00:19:25.352 --> 00:19:26.153
between juniors.

00:19:26.433 --> 00:19:27.032
They want

00:19:27.473 --> 00:19:28.473
competent workers.

00:19:32.032 --> 00:19:32.633
Xiaoyu.

00:19:33.233 --> 00:19:34.153
Impressive.

00:19:36.832 --> 00:19:38.233
Didn't expect that, huh?

00:19:39.393 --> 00:19:40.193
I know you'd

00:19:40.193 --> 00:19:41.552
come around to it.

00:19:43.153 --> 00:19:44.153
I just didn't expect it

00:19:44.473 --> 00:19:45.473
to happen this fast.

00:19:46.633 --> 00:19:48.473
We're back in about ten minutes.

00:19:48.792 --> 00:19:50.233
You calmed down already.

00:19:51.393 --> 00:19:52.008
Impressive.

00:19:52.873 --> 00:19:54.473
I actually calmed down

00:19:54.473 --> 00:19:55.633
by the eighth minute.

00:20:01.393 --> 00:20:02.953
So you'll put up with it?

00:20:03.552 --> 00:20:04.792
Of course not.

00:20:05.633 --> 00:20:07.352
I came up with a plan on the way back.

00:20:07.873 --> 00:20:10.032
I'll save all chat history

00:20:10.032 --> 00:20:11.393
and document everything.

00:20:11.953 --> 00:20:13.193
When the timing's right,

00:20:13.193 --> 00:20:14.713
I'll ask for justice.

00:20:15.153 --> 00:20:16.393
But it won't do me

00:20:16.953 --> 00:20:18.032
any good

00:20:18.352 --> 00:20:19.832
to act impulsively now.

00:20:20.673 --> 00:20:22.953
Mr. Zhou might even think
that I'm stealing

00:20:23.473 --> 00:20:24.752
his junior's credit.

00:20:27.873 --> 00:20:28.393
Xiaoyu.

00:20:30.153 --> 00:20:31.153
You've

00:20:32.433 --> 00:20:33.433
changed so much.

00:20:37.433 --> 00:20:39.352
I didn't go through
all that for nothing.

00:20:40.633 --> 00:20:41.233
Right?

00:20:45.592 --> 00:20:46.473
Who is it? It's late.

00:20:53.072 --> 00:20:53.752
Li Ke?

00:20:56.592 --> 00:20:57.473
What brings you here?

00:20:59.312 --> 00:21:01.112
Is Xiaoyu home?

00:21:03.112 --> 00:21:05.633
I wanted to check on her.

00:21:06.512 --> 00:21:08.993
I made a mistake today.

00:21:10.312 --> 00:21:11.032
Don't be mad.

00:21:12.153 --> 00:21:12.936
Leave me alone.

00:21:14.153 --> 00:21:15.112
We're all friends.

00:21:15.713 --> 00:21:16.673
Just talk it out.

00:21:17.393 --> 00:21:18.393
Why did you come?

00:21:18.832 --> 00:21:19.713
Come on, let's go.

00:21:21.153 --> 00:21:23.153
Let them sort this out.

00:21:23.512 --> 00:21:24.832
Go where? This is my place.

00:21:25.792 --> 00:21:26.473
That's my place.

00:21:28.633 --> 00:21:29.193
Your place?

00:21:30.873 --> 00:21:32.112
It's my aunt's property.

00:21:32.633 --> 00:21:33.928
My cousin returned from abroad.

00:21:34.032 --> 00:21:35.473
I can't stay with them anymore.

00:21:36.112 --> 00:21:37.792
So I asked Li Ke to help me move.

00:21:38.072 --> 00:21:38.993
We're almost done.

00:21:40.193 --> 00:21:40.592
Yeah.

00:21:41.032 --> 00:21:42.312
I wasn't going to help him.

00:21:42.633 --> 00:21:45.393
But I thought I could
use this as an excuse

00:21:45.393 --> 00:21:46.233
to check on Xiaoyu

00:21:47.312 --> 00:21:47.873
and apologize.

00:21:53.393 --> 00:21:54.552
Do you need help?

00:21:54.552 --> 00:21:55.673
Of course. Look.

00:21:55.873 --> 00:21:56.832
So many things to carry.

00:21:57.112 --> 00:21:58.112
All these?

00:22:08.153 --> 00:22:09.153
All of these?

00:22:09.433 --> 00:22:10.312
Just grab one.

00:22:11.393 --> 00:22:12.153
What's going on?

00:22:13.312 --> 00:22:14.153
Personal issue.

00:22:15.072 --> 00:22:16.233
We'd better not interfere.

00:22:16.433 --> 00:22:18.153
Let them resolve it themselves.

00:22:19.112 --> 00:22:20.473
What if they start fighting

00:22:20.673 --> 00:22:21.913
and blood gets shed?

00:22:23.032 --> 00:22:23.713
Perfect.

00:22:23.832 --> 00:22:25.393
You have your things ready

00:22:25.633 --> 00:22:26.233
to move again.

00:22:26.592 --> 00:22:27.193
Seriously?

00:22:28.792 --> 00:22:30.112
You're already trying

00:22:30.552 --> 00:22:31.233
to kick me out?

00:22:33.713 --> 00:22:35.352
Why were you so secretive about it?

00:22:35.792 --> 00:22:36.153
I wasn't.

00:22:37.433 --> 00:22:38.592
I meant to tell you

00:22:38.592 --> 00:22:40.032
during the day.

00:22:40.352 --> 00:22:41.153
But you said

00:22:41.913 --> 00:22:43.433
we'd talk later and ignored me.

00:22:43.913 --> 00:22:45.032
I preserved the evidence.

00:22:45.193 --> 00:22:46.352
Want to see the chat history?

00:22:47.592 --> 00:22:48.913
No wonder you left in a hurry.

00:22:50.312 --> 00:22:51.312
You were watching me?

00:22:51.913 --> 00:22:52.873
I'm flattered.

00:22:53.592 --> 00:22:55.393
You barely looked at me today.

00:22:55.393 --> 00:22:56.792
I thought I'd offended you.

00:23:03.592 --> 00:23:05.473
I didn't know you loved gaming.

00:23:06.153 --> 00:23:07.592
There's plenty you don't know.

00:23:08.153 --> 00:23:09.312
I play when I'm stressed.

00:23:09.913 --> 00:23:11.352
Have you played the games

00:23:11.352 --> 00:23:12.713
made by that producer at Jun An

00:23:12.873 --> 00:23:13.433
yesterday?

00:23:14.112 --> 00:23:14.592
Of course.

00:23:17.112 --> 00:23:19.153
If it's not here, it's in the room.

00:23:23.352 --> 00:23:24.473
W-Wait.

00:23:25.112 --> 00:23:25.673
It's a mess.

00:23:27.032 --> 00:23:28.913
Is there something I shouldn't see?

00:23:29.633 --> 00:23:30.193
No.

00:23:31.352 --> 00:23:32.193
It's just

00:23:33.393 --> 00:23:33.913
really messy.

00:23:37.713 --> 00:23:39.153
A single guy's room always

00:23:39.153 --> 00:23:40.592
hides something they can't show.

00:23:41.233 --> 00:23:42.433
Don't worry, I get it.

00:23:44.193 --> 00:23:45.153
What do you mean?

00:23:51.153 --> 00:23:52.153
Did you work it out?

00:23:52.792 --> 00:23:53.552
Pretty much.

00:23:54.352 --> 00:23:55.473
We're totally fine now.

00:23:57.153 --> 00:23:58.552
Anything else outside?

00:23:59.032 --> 00:23:59.592
Yeah, some.

00:24:01.233 --> 00:24:02.153
Bring them in, please.

00:24:02.233 --> 00:24:02.752
Thank you.

00:24:03.352 --> 00:24:04.393
I'll tidy up the bedroom.

00:24:08.673 --> 00:24:10.393
Let's celebrate Jiang Chen's move.

00:24:10.913 --> 00:24:12.072
Neighbor, let's look out

00:24:12.072 --> 00:24:12.873
for each other.

00:24:13.233 --> 00:24:13.873
Absolutely.

00:24:27.233 --> 00:24:29.153
Come on, didn't I forgive you already?

00:24:31.633 --> 00:24:32.072
Xiaoyu.

00:24:32.592 --> 00:24:32.873
I...

00:24:36.153 --> 00:24:37.433
I want to apologize again.

00:24:40.792 --> 00:24:42.592
Do it when you're sober.

00:24:42.633 --> 00:24:43.633
Not when you're drunk.

00:24:47.873 --> 00:24:49.352
I'll explain everything

00:24:49.352 --> 00:24:50.673
to Mr. Zhou tomorrow.

00:24:51.193 --> 00:24:52.393
As your friend

00:24:52.393 --> 00:24:53.433
and as a competitor,

00:24:53.953 --> 00:24:54.673
I made a mistake.

00:24:55.153 --> 00:24:56.592
But let me explain one thing.

00:24:56.592 --> 00:24:57.713
I didn't mean it.

00:24:58.112 --> 00:24:59.873
I handed in the document to Mr. Zhou,

00:24:59.873 --> 00:25:00.913
and he kept praising me.

00:25:01.312 --> 00:25:02.312
I was thrilled

00:25:02.633 --> 00:25:04.913
and didn't make things clear
at the moment.

00:25:05.393 --> 00:25:06.633
I didn't put your name on it.

00:25:07.112 --> 00:25:08.112
Nor did I put mine.

00:25:08.633 --> 00:25:09.473
I just sent it

00:25:09.473 --> 00:25:10.552
directly to him.

00:25:10.913 --> 00:25:11.913
I swear

00:25:12.032 --> 00:25:14.153
I never intended to steal your work.

00:25:16.072 --> 00:25:17.393
Once I'm at the law firm,

00:25:17.713 --> 00:25:19.993
I'll explain everything
to Mr. Zhou tomorrow.

00:25:23.153 --> 00:25:24.873
When I saw you today,

00:25:25.552 --> 00:25:27.153
I knew you'd be angry.

00:25:27.552 --> 00:25:28.633
So no matter what,

00:25:28.633 --> 00:25:31.193
I know I must
apologize to you right away.

00:25:38.913 --> 00:25:39.433
I drank this

00:25:40.633 --> 00:25:41.832
after the apology.

00:26:05.792 --> 00:26:06.873
What happened to me?

00:26:07.633 --> 00:26:09.393
I've always been number one at school.

00:26:10.032 --> 00:26:11.032
I was even

00:26:11.032 --> 00:26:12.312
the Student Union President.

00:26:13.233 --> 00:26:14.792
But ever since I came to Jun An

00:26:14.792 --> 00:26:15.873
and met you guys,

00:26:16.592 --> 00:26:17.873
I've been almost invisible.

00:26:19.433 --> 00:26:22.072
How I wish the workplace
were like exams.

00:26:22.473 --> 00:26:24.433
If practice guarantees high scores,

00:26:25.193 --> 00:26:26.713
maybe I'd still be number one.

00:26:27.393 --> 00:26:28.584
I'm also a problem grinder.

00:26:29.312 --> 00:26:30.953
But I bombed the college entrance exam.

00:26:31.552 --> 00:26:33.193
My mom almost had a heart attack.

00:26:33.552 --> 00:26:34.473
She kept pushing me

00:26:34.473 --> 00:26:35.953
to study abroad for four years.

00:26:37.312 --> 00:26:39.352
That sounds like a humblebrag to me.

00:26:40.032 --> 00:26:41.713
I wish I could get into the Ivy League.

00:26:42.832 --> 00:26:43.873
I just can't accept this.

00:26:44.433 --> 00:26:45.633
I was doing just fine.

00:26:45.953 --> 00:26:47.193
How did I end up like this?

00:26:47.913 --> 00:26:49.393
My parents and sister

00:26:49.792 --> 00:26:50.993
have so much faith in me.

00:26:51.592 --> 00:26:52.193
My sister

00:26:52.713 --> 00:26:53.633
thinks I'm better

00:26:54.153 --> 00:26:55.032
than all of you.

00:26:56.393 --> 00:26:57.713
I can't let her down.

00:26:59.873 --> 00:27:00.552
So, Xiaoyu...

00:27:00.633 --> 00:27:01.112
I get it.

00:27:01.953 --> 00:27:02.792
You're forgiven.

00:27:16.433 --> 00:27:18.032
I really love Beijing.

00:27:18.913 --> 00:27:20.873
No matter what pressures I face,

00:27:22.072 --> 00:27:23.312
I swear I'll stay.

00:27:26.633 --> 00:27:27.752
You should too.

00:27:28.393 --> 00:27:30.032
Whatever obstacles come your way,

00:27:30.552 --> 00:27:32.352
stay here and hold your ground.

00:27:36.352 --> 00:27:37.512
Yes, we will.

00:27:38.673 --> 00:27:39.552
Go for it.

00:27:49.592 --> 00:27:49.993
Cheers!

00:27:55.272 --> 00:27:56.112
Bottoms up.

00:27:56.153 --> 00:27:56.776
Bottoms up.

00:27:56.873 --> 00:27:58.032
Bottoms up, buddies.

00:28:07.473 --> 00:28:08.352
Stay.

00:28:10.592 --> 00:28:12.552
Jiatong, wake me up for work tomorrow.

00:28:20.993 --> 00:28:21.576
She's asleep?

00:28:24.433 --> 00:28:25.032
So,

00:28:28.233 --> 00:28:28.713
I'm off.

00:28:51.592 --> 00:28:52.233
Can I go to

00:28:53.153 --> 00:28:53.873
your place?

00:29:01.072 --> 00:29:02.032
At such a late hour?

00:29:02.713 --> 00:29:03.312
Yes.

00:29:04.473 --> 00:29:05.752
What are you afraid of?

00:29:06.512 --> 00:29:08.032
I only drank water tonight.

00:29:08.673 --> 00:29:09.633
No alcohol at all.

00:29:09.993 --> 00:29:11.633
I can't even mess with you legally.

00:29:12.272 --> 00:29:12.673
Easy.

00:29:16.792 --> 00:29:17.592
W-Why don't you

00:29:18.713 --> 00:29:19.552
think twice?

00:29:19.552 --> 00:29:20.473
What for?

00:29:23.272 --> 00:29:24.352
What do you want?

00:29:27.832 --> 00:29:29.193
Can I play those games

00:29:29.193 --> 00:29:30.193
you mentioned?

00:29:31.233 --> 00:29:31.792
Play games?

00:29:33.592 --> 00:29:34.032
Yeah.

00:29:35.352 --> 00:29:36.393
What were you thinking?

00:29:40.713 --> 00:29:42.312
I thought you fancied some furniture.

00:29:55.592 --> 00:29:57.233
Their games are really fun.

00:29:57.552 --> 00:29:58.953
I'm getting hooked even though

00:29:59.072 --> 00:30:00.032
I don't play games.

00:30:00.512 --> 00:30:02.153
That company had a rough time.

00:30:02.312 --> 00:30:03.072
It started

00:30:03.072 --> 00:30:05.112
with three college roommates

00:30:05.873 --> 00:30:07.393
who wanted to make a game together.

00:30:07.873 --> 00:30:09.473
They ran out of funds halfway through

00:30:09.953 --> 00:30:11.352
and signed an adhesion contract

00:30:11.352 --> 00:30:12.592
with a big corporation.

00:30:13.393 --> 00:30:14.352
The game was done

00:30:14.592 --> 00:30:15.336
and went viral.

00:30:15.953 --> 00:30:17.873
But the major shareholders
kicked them out

00:30:18.352 --> 00:30:19.433
and banned them

00:30:19.433 --> 00:30:21.552
from ever using
the game universe they created.

00:30:22.112 --> 00:30:23.193
Too bad they never

00:30:23.552 --> 00:30:24.832
consulted a lawyer.

00:30:25.953 --> 00:30:27.153
Why did you come to play games

00:30:27.153 --> 00:30:28.233
at this hour?

00:30:30.352 --> 00:30:31.072
No reason.

00:30:34.713 --> 00:30:35.752
Just curious.

00:30:36.592 --> 00:30:37.128
Seriously.

00:30:38.352 --> 00:30:38.953
Besides,

00:30:39.352 --> 00:30:41.312
they wanted to hold
a housewarming party.

00:30:41.913 --> 00:30:43.352
But they can't hold their liquor.

00:30:43.393 --> 00:30:44.312
So it's only me.

00:30:45.433 --> 00:30:45.953
Then what?

00:30:47.433 --> 00:30:47.792
What?

00:30:48.312 --> 00:30:49.953
What happened to those partners?

00:30:50.633 --> 00:30:52.592
They made a comeback.

00:30:53.352 --> 00:30:54.752
Gold will always shine.

00:30:55.272 --> 00:30:56.393
They created another game,

00:30:56.913 --> 00:30:58.792
which gained even more fame.

00:30:59.072 --> 00:31:00.193
The one you're playing.

00:31:01.592 --> 00:31:02.233
The man who

00:31:02.233 --> 00:31:02.913
came to Jun An

00:31:02.913 --> 00:31:03.633
was their CEO.

00:31:04.473 --> 00:31:05.272
Impressive.

00:31:08.953 --> 00:31:11.713
You think their real lives

00:31:11.713 --> 00:31:13.193
are just like in the game?

00:31:13.953 --> 00:31:15.393
The passionate youths

00:31:15.393 --> 00:31:17.312
don't quit when they face setbacks.

00:31:17.552 --> 00:31:19.153
They keep chasing their dreams

00:31:19.433 --> 00:31:20.312
to save the world.

00:31:20.832 --> 00:31:21.993
They did that in the game

00:31:22.752 --> 00:31:23.473
and in real life.

00:31:27.032 --> 00:31:27.512
You know?

00:31:27.512 --> 00:31:29.153
I love souls-like games.

00:31:29.752 --> 00:31:31.873
I've always thought
that if they made one,

00:31:32.112 --> 00:31:33.233
it would be amazing.

00:31:33.913 --> 00:31:35.112
What are souls-like games?

00:31:37.433 --> 00:31:39.993
They feature deep storytelling

00:31:40.153 --> 00:31:42.433
with brutally difficult combat.

00:31:42.433 --> 00:31:43.752
Think of them as

00:31:43.752 --> 00:31:44.953
extremely tough

00:31:44.953 --> 00:31:45.592
RPGs.

00:31:46.112 --> 00:31:46.673
So,

00:31:46.673 --> 00:31:49.193
you might beat it once
after a hundred tries.

00:31:50.993 --> 00:31:52.393
Lawyering's hard enough.

00:31:52.473 --> 00:31:53.752
Why get tortured

00:31:53.953 --> 00:31:54.592
in games too?

00:31:54.792 --> 00:31:57.072
That's the essence of soul-likes.

00:31:57.473 --> 00:31:59.832
You have to fight repeatedly.

00:32:00.032 --> 00:32:01.193
You might face a boss

00:32:01.193 --> 00:32:02.673
who seems unbeatable.

00:32:02.873 --> 00:32:04.233
But you keep battling.

00:32:04.393 --> 00:32:05.792
You memorize their patterns

00:32:05.792 --> 00:32:06.832
and attack sequences.

00:32:07.112 --> 00:32:08.433
When you finally win,

00:32:08.433 --> 00:32:10.312
the satisfaction is incredible.

00:32:11.473 --> 00:32:12.352
Simply put,

00:32:12.352 --> 00:32:14.352
I'm drawn to that self-challenging rush.

00:32:14.953 --> 00:32:16.512
So you're meant to be a lawyer.

00:32:17.072 --> 00:32:17.552
How so?

00:32:18.153 --> 00:32:20.713
You approach every task meticulously.

00:32:20.873 --> 00:32:22.512
You're logical and driven.

00:32:22.713 --> 00:32:24.112
You're strict with yourself

00:32:24.193 --> 00:32:25.393
and enjoy challenges.

00:32:25.592 --> 00:32:26.352
I don't get

00:32:26.352 --> 00:32:27.352
how you find time

00:32:27.352 --> 00:32:29.233
for the gym after work every day.

00:32:29.832 --> 00:32:30.673
It's just that

00:32:30.752 --> 00:32:32.633
I'm not sure
if you're really working out.

00:32:33.233 --> 00:32:35.112
You don't look like
you have an eight-pack.

00:32:36.512 --> 00:32:38.233
I-I don't have an eight-pack.

00:32:38.953 --> 00:32:40.272
It's a six-pack. Want proof?

00:32:40.673 --> 00:32:41.193
Show me.

00:32:46.552 --> 00:32:47.072
Next time.

00:32:50.993 --> 00:32:52.473
Isn't it my housewarming party?

00:32:52.913 --> 00:32:54.512
Let's have a drink.

00:32:55.272 --> 00:32:55.752
Cheers.

00:32:56.193 --> 00:32:56.873
Happy moving.

00:32:57.352 --> 00:32:58.072
All the best.

00:33:04.233 --> 00:33:05.913
No one has wished me
all the best in ages.

00:33:06.713 --> 00:33:08.752
The last time my college boyfriend

00:33:08.832 --> 00:33:10.153
celebrated my birthday,

00:33:10.633 --> 00:33:11.832
he wished me success.

00:33:13.433 --> 00:33:14.233
So down-to-earth.

00:33:15.272 --> 00:33:16.512
So, he knew you well.

00:33:17.393 --> 00:33:19.433
Were you constantly radiating

00:33:19.433 --> 00:33:21.393
that "I must win" energy?

00:33:26.552 --> 00:33:26.953
Sorry.

00:33:33.112 --> 00:33:34.193
How did you break up?

00:33:39.873 --> 00:33:41.792
I kept winning, and he couldn't take it.

00:33:43.153 --> 00:33:44.433
His loss then.

00:33:44.913 --> 00:33:46.913
You instantly took my side.

00:33:47.352 --> 00:33:47.873
Of course.

00:33:48.193 --> 00:33:49.993
He's probably kicking himself now.

00:33:51.112 --> 00:33:52.032
Totally agree.

00:34:14.552 --> 00:34:15.632
Thanks for coming.

00:34:16.433 --> 00:34:16.793
I had

00:34:17.512 --> 00:34:18.112
a lot of fun.

00:34:18.833 --> 00:34:19.993
Don't flatter yourself.

00:34:21.192 --> 00:34:22.632
I've been drinking.

00:34:23.152 --> 00:34:24.353
Push me too far,

00:34:24.592 --> 00:34:25.192
and you'll

00:34:25.512 --> 00:34:26.552
face legal consequences.

00:34:32.393 --> 00:34:33.112
Try me.

00:34:34.032 --> 00:34:35.313
I'm the best lawyer.

00:34:37.712 --> 00:34:38.712
Don't get carried away.

00:34:38.833 --> 00:34:41.552
I know 108 legal provisions
to hold you accountable.

00:35:13.793 --> 00:35:15.433
(What exactly are we now?)

00:35:21.152 --> 00:35:22.112
It's almost 1:00 AM.

00:35:22.112 --> 00:35:22.913
I should head back.

00:35:23.672 --> 00:35:24.512
Good night.

00:35:26.953 --> 00:35:27.720
(I'm asking you.)

00:35:29.833 --> 00:35:31.080
(It's your first time asking.)

00:35:31.592 --> 00:35:32.313
(Let me think.)

00:35:32.313 --> 00:35:33.313
Tencent Video.

00:35:33.313 --> 00:35:33.913
(Think?)

00:35:33.913 --> 00:35:36.232
(Power off)

00:36:03.072 --> 00:36:03.592
Come clean.

00:36:04.793 --> 00:36:06.433
You came back super late last night.

00:36:06.993 --> 00:36:09.072
I heard the door at 1:00 AM.

00:36:09.632 --> 00:36:10.393
Come clean.

00:36:10.993 --> 00:36:11.953
Where did you go?

00:36:16.712 --> 00:36:17.712
My baby Jiatong

00:36:17.712 --> 00:36:19.793
is keeping secrets from me?

00:36:20.632 --> 00:36:22.913
Tell me what's going on!

00:36:23.032 --> 00:36:24.192
Who stole you from me?

00:36:25.592 --> 00:36:26.712
Ren Jiatong.

00:36:31.632 --> 00:36:33.592
Why are you also acting

00:36:34.232 --> 00:36:35.112
weird today?

00:36:36.473 --> 00:36:37.473
Please elaborate.

00:36:40.072 --> 00:36:41.032
Your dark circles look

00:36:41.192 --> 00:36:42.152
terribly heavy.

00:36:42.833 --> 00:36:45.032
You didn't sleep well in the new place

00:36:45.393 --> 00:36:46.433
last night?

00:36:47.993 --> 00:36:48.712
Impressive.

00:36:50.473 --> 00:36:52.112
I didn't sleep well.

00:36:54.632 --> 00:36:56.473
I heard something next door,

00:36:56.473 --> 00:36:58.112
maybe from your room.

00:36:58.592 --> 00:36:59.712
Loud snores.

00:36:59.712 --> 00:37:00.632
I don't snore.

00:37:06.273 --> 00:37:07.473
Mr. Zhou wants to meet us

00:37:08.793 --> 00:37:09.704
in the conference

00:37:11.032 --> 00:37:11.393
room.

00:37:15.592 --> 00:37:16.592
Li Ke, Guo Xiaoyu.

00:37:16.712 --> 00:37:18.433
You both did a great job.

00:37:18.512 --> 00:37:19.473
I updated your mentors

00:37:19.473 --> 00:37:20.833
about what Li Ke told me.

00:37:21.112 --> 00:37:22.433
After discussion

00:37:22.793 --> 00:37:23.833
and evaluation,

00:37:24.032 --> 00:37:26.032
Guo Xiaoyu earns 20 points this round.

00:37:26.273 --> 00:37:27.473
(Score +20)
Li Ke gets 10 points.

00:37:32.349 --> 00:37:32.873
(Score +10)

00:37:32.873 --> 00:37:33.833
The fifth round

00:37:33.993 --> 00:37:36.512
of the Talent Hunt Program starts today.

00:37:36.793 --> 00:37:39.232
I'm going to announce the first task.

00:37:39.816 --> 00:37:42.152
(Case Overview)

00:37:42.152 --> 00:37:44.032
You know
Tian Kai Xin Gaming Company, right?

00:37:44.152 --> 00:37:45.273
It's grown rapidly.

00:37:45.592 --> 00:37:46.552
Their CEO met with

00:37:46.592 --> 00:37:47.632
Mr. Song yesterday.

00:37:47.833 --> 00:37:48.953
They want Jun An

00:37:49.072 --> 00:37:50.433
to provide guidance during

00:37:50.592 --> 00:37:51.993
the upcoming funding rounds.

00:37:52.592 --> 00:37:53.032
Mr. Zhou,

00:37:53.433 --> 00:37:54.833
I've looked into this industry.

00:37:55.273 --> 00:37:55.873
The company

00:37:55.873 --> 00:37:57.993
had a law firm it regularly retained.

00:37:58.152 --> 00:37:59.353
Why are they switching to us?

00:37:59.592 --> 00:38:01.192
They were small before,

00:38:01.232 --> 00:38:02.473
but now, at Series C funding,

00:38:02.512 --> 00:38:04.273
they're looking for a larger firm.

00:38:05.473 --> 00:38:05.913
Mr. Zhou.

00:38:06.512 --> 00:38:09.112
This company's
three partners, executives,

00:38:09.112 --> 00:38:10.433
and core tech team

00:38:10.552 --> 00:38:11.953
haven't signed any non-competes.

00:38:12.793 --> 00:38:13.112
Yeah.

00:38:13.672 --> 00:38:14.953
It's another reason

00:38:15.072 --> 00:38:17.152
Series C investors urged them
to switch firms.

00:38:17.313 --> 00:38:19.032
Their previous law firm

00:38:19.152 --> 00:38:20.833
didn't advise them on non-competes.

00:38:21.273 --> 00:38:23.072
I know their Creative Director

00:38:23.072 --> 00:38:24.793
was one of the three founders.

00:38:25.112 --> 00:38:26.313
And he has resigned.

00:38:26.473 --> 00:38:27.313
If they hadn't

00:38:27.313 --> 00:38:28.953
signed any non-competes back then,

00:38:28.953 --> 00:38:31.393
the situation
is extremely risky right now.

00:38:31.672 --> 00:38:33.793
They've worked together and overcome

00:38:33.953 --> 00:38:35.873
so many hardships together.

00:38:36.353 --> 00:38:37.953
Why are they splitting up

00:38:37.953 --> 00:38:38.833
after succeeding?

00:38:38.953 --> 00:38:40.032
How did they end up

00:38:40.393 --> 00:38:42.152
suspecting each other of betrayal?

00:38:45.833 --> 00:38:46.833
What's wrong?

00:38:46.953 --> 00:38:48.473
This might be something

00:38:48.552 --> 00:38:49.433
we should

00:38:49.433 --> 00:38:51.072
keep an eye on going forward.

00:38:54.313 --> 00:38:55.112
Tian Kai Xin's CEO

00:38:55.232 --> 00:38:56.072
wants Jun An

00:38:56.072 --> 00:38:57.512
to conduct preliminary

00:38:57.512 --> 00:38:58.473
funding assistance work,

00:38:58.833 --> 00:38:59.953
which includes

00:38:59.953 --> 00:39:01.632
internal audit and rectification.

00:39:02.353 --> 00:39:04.152
Mr. Zhou, I saw

00:39:04.152 --> 00:39:05.152
Tian Kai Xin's CEO

00:39:05.152 --> 00:39:05.993
at Jun An yesterday.

00:39:06.112 --> 00:39:07.793
Though unclear on specifics,

00:39:07.793 --> 00:39:09.433
I've compiled materials

00:39:09.672 --> 00:39:11.592
on all their games

00:39:11.592 --> 00:39:13.632
since their founding day.

00:39:13.833 --> 00:39:15.993
Plus my insights as a veteran player.

00:39:16.313 --> 00:39:18.112
I'll send it to everyone shortly.

00:39:19.313 --> 00:39:20.152
Veteran player?

00:39:21.353 --> 00:39:21.793
Yeah.

00:39:22.512 --> 00:39:24.632
When did you do this?

00:39:24.913 --> 00:39:25.873
My goodness.

00:39:26.552 --> 00:39:27.072
Very good.

00:39:27.393 --> 00:39:27.953
Mr. Song

00:39:28.273 --> 00:39:28.913
will pick

00:39:28.993 --> 00:39:31.232
an assistant to support him.

00:39:31.592 --> 00:39:32.192
Strive for

00:39:32.512 --> 00:39:33.592
this opportunity.

00:39:33.913 --> 00:39:37.112
Mr. Zhou, I am Mr. Song's assistant.

00:39:37.112 --> 00:39:39.592
Why select someone else?

00:39:40.032 --> 00:39:40.833
His exact words.

00:39:41.473 --> 00:39:42.712
"It's a rare assignment."

00:39:42.913 --> 00:39:44.192
"We want the best on it."

00:39:44.433 --> 00:39:45.953
Everyone gets a shot in principle.

00:39:52.962 --> 00:39:53.732
(Non-compete Agreement)

00:39:53.732 --> 00:39:55.402
(Explanation: An agreement
that prohibits the employee)

00:39:55.402 --> 00:39:56.422
(from engaging in business activities
competitive with the employer)

00:39:56.422 --> 00:39:58.852
(for a specified period
after termination of employment.)

00:39:58.852 --> 00:40:00.672
(The employer
must pay financial compensation.)

00:40:00.672 --> 00:40:02.592
Impressive, veteran player.

00:40:02.873 --> 00:40:04.353
You came to play games last night

00:40:04.592 --> 00:40:05.953
just for the task today?

00:40:07.712 --> 00:40:08.512
That was the plan.

00:40:10.632 --> 00:40:11.112
Honestly,

00:40:11.112 --> 00:40:13.072
I really admire your low-key

00:40:13.592 --> 00:40:14.473
and reserved nature.

00:40:14.873 --> 00:40:15.913
You'll be a great lawyer

00:40:15.913 --> 00:40:17.032
and even a spy.

00:40:17.512 --> 00:40:18.632
If you guessed

00:40:18.632 --> 00:40:20.313
the topic of the final essay,

00:40:20.393 --> 00:40:22.192
would you tell your biggest competitor?

00:40:22.993 --> 00:40:24.112
Biggest competitor?

00:40:24.793 --> 00:40:26.032
You think so highly of me?

00:40:26.473 --> 00:40:27.032
Of course.

00:40:27.353 --> 00:40:29.552
You'll always be my runner-up.

00:40:31.793 --> 00:40:32.592
Except in games.

00:40:34.433 --> 00:40:36.192
"That was the plan." And then what?

00:40:37.273 --> 00:40:38.112
And then,

00:40:39.232 --> 00:40:39.712
it changed.

00:40:42.672 --> 00:40:43.313
I knew it.

00:40:44.433 --> 00:40:45.232
Work hard.

00:40:45.712 --> 00:40:46.393
Veteran player.

00:41:08.512 --> 00:41:10.833
Mr. Song, this is the game

00:41:10.833 --> 00:41:12.192
Tian Kai Xin is developing.

00:41:12.512 --> 00:41:13.753
I checked with Mr. Zhou.

00:41:13.913 --> 00:41:14.433
It's their

00:41:14.433 --> 00:41:16.072
key project after this round of funding.

00:41:19.273 --> 00:41:21.793
Here's a game still in development

00:41:21.993 --> 00:41:23.873
I found on gaming forums.

00:41:24.152 --> 00:41:25.712
It hasn't been launched.

00:41:26.032 --> 00:41:27.833
Its game universe,
mechanics, and gameplay

00:41:28.313 --> 00:41:29.393
are virtually identical

00:41:29.393 --> 00:41:31.313
to those of Tian Kai Xin's game.

00:41:32.393 --> 00:41:33.433
Are you suggesting

00:41:33.433 --> 00:41:35.232
that their idea has been leaked?

00:41:37.592 --> 00:41:38.592
Is the poster

00:41:39.152 --> 00:41:39.833
anonymous?

00:41:40.192 --> 00:41:40.793
I suspect

00:41:40.833 --> 00:41:42.953
it's someone from another game company.

00:41:42.993 --> 00:41:44.873
Typically, some games

00:41:44.873 --> 00:41:45.953
test the waters

00:41:46.112 --> 00:41:48.552
pre-launch in some niche forums

00:41:48.873 --> 00:41:50.152
to decide whether to proceed

00:41:50.273 --> 00:41:52.712
based on professional gamers' feedback.

00:41:53.152 --> 00:41:53.953
If this game

00:41:53.953 --> 00:41:56.232
gets released before
Tian Kai Xin's game,

00:41:56.232 --> 00:41:57.632
it could be a heavy blow

00:41:57.632 --> 00:41:58.873
to Tian Kai Xin

00:41:59.152 --> 00:42:00.353
and cause huge damage.

00:42:00.592 --> 00:42:01.433
And I noticed that

00:42:01.552 --> 00:42:02.273
in their Series C

00:42:02.273 --> 00:42:03.712
funding agreement,

00:42:03.913 --> 00:42:06.512
investors added earn-out clauses.

00:42:06.882 --> 00:42:08.492
(Earn-out Clause)

00:42:08.492 --> 00:42:10.302
(Explanation: A clause
in investment agreements)

00:42:10.302 --> 00:42:12.912
(requiring compensation to investors
if the target company fails)

00:42:12.912 --> 00:42:14.712
(to meet performance targets.)

00:42:14.712 --> 00:42:15.192
If

00:42:15.953 --> 00:42:18.152
Tian Kai Xin's game fails this time,

00:42:18.512 --> 00:42:19.433
they'll face

00:42:19.433 --> 00:42:20.993
massive compensation.

00:42:21.592 --> 00:42:22.672
We have to

00:42:22.672 --> 00:42:24.353
get ahead of this

00:42:24.712 --> 00:42:25.712
and eliminate the risk.

00:42:26.632 --> 00:42:28.473
Tian Kai Xin's founders haven't

00:42:28.753 --> 00:42:29.953
signed any non-competes.

00:42:30.473 --> 00:42:31.313
But it doesn't mean

00:42:31.512 --> 00:42:32.873
they can leak trade secrets.

00:42:33.473 --> 00:42:34.313
This is illegal.

00:42:39.072 --> 00:42:39.632
Mr. Zhou.

00:42:39.953 --> 00:42:40.393
It's me.

00:42:41.192 --> 00:42:41.993
Set up a meeting

00:42:41.993 --> 00:42:43.313
with Tian Kai Xin ASAP.

00:42:44.473 --> 00:42:44.833
Also,

00:42:45.273 --> 00:42:45.953
check whether

00:42:46.273 --> 00:42:48.592
their Creative Director
joined another gaming company.

00:42:49.393 --> 00:42:49.753
Okay.

00:42:53.552 --> 00:42:54.512
Mr. Song, I actually

00:42:55.192 --> 00:42:56.313
have a theory.

00:42:56.953 --> 00:42:57.873
I suspect the poster

00:42:57.873 --> 00:42:58.833
works for RE Games.

00:42:59.473 --> 00:43:00.313
Because the poster

00:43:00.313 --> 00:43:02.913
only liked and commented on posts

00:43:03.192 --> 00:43:04.672
related to RE's games.

00:43:07.112 --> 00:43:07.592
Jiang Chen.

00:43:08.712 --> 00:43:09.672
You are doing

00:43:10.232 --> 00:43:10.993
a great job.

00:43:13.232 --> 00:43:13.993
Thank you.

00:43:15.554 --> 00:43:16.968
(Must all employees sign non-competes?
Once signed, must it be obeyed?)

00:43:16.968 --> 00:43:17.960
(Answer: Not all employees.)

00:43:17.960 --> 00:43:19.496
(Article 24 of the Labor Contract Law
stipulates that)

00:43:19.496 --> 00:43:21.256
(non-compete obligations apply solely to
senior management, key technical employees,)

00:43:21.256 --> 00:43:23.336
(and employees exposed to core business secrets
and bound by non-disclosure obligations.)

00:43:23.336 --> 00:43:24.584
(Moreover, if the agreement fails
to provide for compensation)

00:43:24.584 --> 00:43:25.608
(or contains an overly broad scope
of restrictions,)

00:43:25.608 --> 00:43:27.004
(the employee may claim the agreement
is invalid either wholly or in part,)

00:43:27.004 --> 00:43:28.104
(and refuse to perform it.)
