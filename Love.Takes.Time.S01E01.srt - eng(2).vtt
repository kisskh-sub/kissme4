(Theory of Love)

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
(Christmas Day 2014)

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.600
I’m about to graduate.

00:00:44.966 --> 00:00:46.400
We won’t get to see
each other as much.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:48.500
I don’t want that.

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:55.900
Be my girlfriend.

00:00:58.933 --> 00:00:59.933
What do you say?

00:01:00.866 --> 00:01:01.866
Of course!

00:01:15.233 --> 00:01:16.500
Cut!

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.500
Great job, everyone.

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:22.566
That’s a wrap.

00:01:26.533 --> 00:01:27.566
- Good job.
- Finally.

00:01:27.833 --> 00:01:29.200
Tanwa is so cool.

00:01:29.366 --> 00:01:31.066
He’s handsome.
How does he not have a girlfriend?

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.666
Do you think he’s gay?

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.000
You’re talking nonsense.

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.033
I won’t bother you anymore. Thanks.

00:01:38.866 --> 00:01:40.400
- You can check it.
- Okay.

00:01:40.566 --> 00:01:42.766
- Make sure everything’s okay.
- Hey.

00:01:42.966 --> 00:01:43.966
Ouch.

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:45.900
Are you okay?

00:01:49.333 --> 00:01:50.333
Are you all right?

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.100
I'm fine. It's okay.

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.200
Come on, let me help you.

00:01:57.933 --> 00:01:58.933
Thank you.

00:02:02.766 --> 00:02:03.766
Hey.

00:02:04.133 --> 00:02:05.300
Are you a freshman?

00:02:07.033 --> 00:02:08.033
Yes.

00:02:08.033 --> 00:02:09.500
Thank you for helping out.

00:02:10.333 --> 00:02:12.033
What's your name?

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.000
My mom

00:02:17.733 --> 00:02:19.400
named me Sai.

00:02:20.133 --> 00:02:23.333
But when I started college,
I changed my name

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000
to Sandy.

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.300
Your mom calls you Sai at home,

00:02:29.533 --> 00:02:31.100
but once you’re in the big city,

00:02:31.333 --> 00:02:33.900
you’re suddenly Sandy.

00:02:34.366 --> 00:02:36.333
Shut up. Stop it.

00:02:36.966 --> 00:02:38.600
I think Sandy suits you.

00:02:39.233 --> 00:02:40.600
- Thank you.
- Sandy.

00:02:41.033 --> 00:02:43.200
There’s a Christmas party tonight.
Do you want to go?

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.733
I know, but...

00:02:48.133 --> 00:02:49.133
I’m a lightweight.

00:02:49.333 --> 00:02:50.333
Also,

00:02:50.966 --> 00:02:52.066
I don't know how to dance.

00:02:56.933 --> 00:02:59.500
Give me more!

00:02:59.566 --> 00:03:02.733
Bottoms up!

00:03:22.833 --> 00:03:28.000
Tan!

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:53.600
Hello?

00:03:53.866 --> 00:03:56.266
I’m about to go home,
I already told you.

00:03:56.533 --> 00:03:59.700
I’m out with the guy
I shot the short film with.

00:03:59.733 --> 00:04:00.766
I’ll head home soon.

00:04:02.333 --> 00:04:04.233
You should’ve come today.

00:04:04.666 --> 00:04:05.900
Let me tell you.

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.033
Such a joy to the world...

00:04:09.033 --> 00:04:10.033
What...

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.333
Darn it.

00:04:18.666 --> 00:04:21.166
It's nothing.

00:04:23.033 --> 00:04:24.100
I saw something really shocking.

00:04:29.866 --> 00:04:31.633
Santa’s here to pick me up.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.033
Fine, I’ll call Santa. Hey!

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:38.300
Hey.

00:04:38.966 --> 00:04:40.533
Santa's here.

00:04:40.933 --> 00:04:42.666
I have to go.

00:04:50.033 --> 00:04:52.700
I didn’t see anything, Tan.

00:04:53.666 --> 00:04:56.200
My eyes didn’t see anything.

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.333
Everything’s so blurry.

00:05:00.166 --> 00:05:01.700
One more thing.

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:04.233
You can be anything you want.

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.166
Just be yourself, don’t be shy.

00:05:08.166 --> 00:05:09.600
- Hold on, Sandy.
- Do you understand?

00:05:09.766 --> 00:05:11.333
I understand.

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:12.633
Wait.

00:05:13.366 --> 00:05:14.466
What do you think I am?

00:05:15.433 --> 00:05:17.500
Oh. Tan...

00:05:18.433 --> 00:05:19.766
You don’t like girls.

00:05:21.033 --> 00:05:23.233
No, Sandy.

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:24.866
Listen to me carefully.

00:05:25.066 --> 00:05:27.066
I was helping my friend.

00:05:27.166 --> 00:05:30.800
He’s going to an audition,
and there’s a scene

00:05:31.133 --> 00:05:33.266
where he has to make love
with a guy.

00:05:33.266 --> 00:05:34.900
But he’s too shy to do it.

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:36.600
So I wanted him to...

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:40.166
Tan, don’t be shy.

00:05:40.166 --> 00:05:42.400
Just admit it.
We’re in a new era now.

00:05:42.533 --> 00:05:44.800
You can be absolutely anything.

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:48.800
Love is a beautiful thing, Tan.

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:51.200
I understand.

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:55.100
Your boyfriend is so cute.

00:05:56.066 --> 00:05:58.566
- You two look so good together.
- Hey.

00:05:59.466 --> 00:06:02.533
You guys are adorable.

00:06:02.933 --> 00:06:04.600
It’s not like that.

00:06:04.966 --> 00:06:06.466
Trust me.

00:06:07.533 --> 00:06:09.133
Okay.

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:12.100
But Santa’s almost here.

00:06:13.733 --> 00:06:14.733
Santa?

00:06:14.766 --> 00:06:15.866
Yes.

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:20.466
Santa’s picking me up.

00:06:20.566 --> 00:06:22.500
But I’m so wasted,

00:06:24.266 --> 00:06:27.600
I don’t think I’ll make it back.

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:28.600
So...

00:06:30.266 --> 00:06:31.400
Sister.

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:35.100
Tandy, please take me home.

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:36.600
Please.

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.833
- Tandy?
- Yes.

00:06:39.166 --> 00:06:40.200
Tandy.

00:06:40.433 --> 00:06:42.033
That's right.

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:43.700
Tandy.

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:47.300
- Santa's here. I'm here.
- Tandy?

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:50.100
Jingle bells.

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:53.400
Sandy, be careful.

00:06:53.533 --> 00:06:55.200
- Sandy.
- Hello.

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:57.900
I'm so sorry.

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:00.566
- I'm sorry.
- Hello, Santa.

00:07:00.766 --> 00:07:03.366
- Is that right?
- Yes, he's Santa.

00:07:04.133 --> 00:07:05.133
Let's go.

00:07:05.133 --> 00:07:06.766
Be careful.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.066
You look so funny.

00:07:15.333 --> 00:07:17.066
Thank you for taking me home.

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:19.600
You're welcome.

00:07:19.766 --> 00:07:21.566
Do you really not like guys?

00:07:24.033 --> 00:07:25.300
Why stress yourself out?

00:07:26.566 --> 00:07:27.600
It’s nothing.

00:07:29.466 --> 00:07:30.733
Fine, I’ll give it a shot.

00:07:31.566 --> 00:07:32.566
Yes.

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:46.300
I don’t like guys.

00:07:51.766 --> 00:07:53.066
Then prove it.

00:07:58.100 --> 00:07:59.100
Wait.

00:08:02.433 --> 00:08:04.500
Don’t overthink it.

00:08:05.766 --> 00:08:06.833
You said

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:09.500
it’s just a kiss.

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:27.466
Don’t joke with me, Sandy.

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:29.200
What if I’m not joking?

00:08:33.666 --> 00:08:35.433
What kind of guy are you?

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.166
You’re alone with a girl,

00:08:38.766 --> 00:08:39.766
but you won’t do anything.

00:08:41.833 --> 00:08:45.266
So you really are gay, right?

00:08:45.766 --> 00:08:50.333
Come on, just be honest with me.
It’s fine.

00:08:50.333 --> 00:08:51.533
We’re in a new era now.

00:08:51.766 --> 00:08:53.266
You are gay.

00:08:53.433 --> 00:08:54.966
- You are gay.
- No.

00:08:54.966 --> 00:08:56.633
Be quiet.

00:08:56.666 --> 00:09:00.766
Your neighbor will hear you.
It’s late, Sandy.

00:09:01.033 --> 00:09:02.833
I’m just a gentleman.

00:09:03.433 --> 00:09:04.433
A gentleman.

00:09:05.833 --> 00:09:06.833
All right?

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:13.266
Why are you laughing?

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:15.833
I'll get going.

00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:17.400
Don't forget to lock the door.

00:09:18.166 --> 00:09:19.700
Take a shower and go to bed.

00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:22.666
I have to go, you naughty girl.

00:09:23.066 --> 00:09:26.033
No one has ever taken
such good care of me before.

00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:34.333
You’re the best Christmas gift
this year, Tan.

00:09:36.233 --> 00:09:38.266
Merry Christmas!

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:41.400
I have to go.

00:09:41.666 --> 00:09:42.666
Merry Christmas.

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:46.200
Let me know when you're home.

00:09:46.633 --> 00:09:47.633
Sure.

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:51.600
- Jingle bells. Jingle all the way.
- Be quiet.

00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:53.300
Keep your voice down.

00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:55.133
Go to bed now.

00:09:55.966 --> 00:09:56.966
Be quiet.

00:10:31.933 --> 00:10:32.933
I'm home.

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:39.500
Good night.

00:10:45.433 --> 00:10:46.433
Good night.

00:10:57.433 --> 00:10:59.733
That was the beginning of
the special, label-less relationship

00:10:59.966 --> 00:11:03.266
between Tan and me, Aoy and Chod.

00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:06.600
(January 2015)

00:11:06.666 --> 00:11:08.333
We had just met,

00:11:08.566 --> 00:11:10.733
but it felt like
we were already so close.

00:11:11.666 --> 00:11:13.800
Tan often called to wake me up.

00:11:14.933 --> 00:11:16.266
Hello, Tan.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.500
I thought you said you were going
to be the new you and wake up early.

00:11:20.433 --> 00:11:22.300
Did you just want me to wake you up?

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:24.833
I’m already up.

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:31.533
We went to school and came home
together almost every day.

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:33.700
Everyone thought we were together.

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:37.166
Are you two dating?

00:11:41.766 --> 00:11:43.933
We were on the phone
almost every night.

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:47.100
We had things to talk about
for hours.

00:11:47.466 --> 00:11:48.966
We never got bored of each other.

00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:54.600
We always hung out on our days off.

00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:57.433
Tan always asked me
to go out and take photos.

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:23.200
(2016)

00:12:23.266 --> 00:12:25.700
Happy birthday to you.

00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:27.866
Time flew by,

00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:33.266
and I realized we were in
each other’s lives on special days

00:12:33.833 --> 00:12:34.833
every single year.

00:12:38.066 --> 00:12:39.500
I graduated!

00:12:42.566 --> 00:12:45.166
You two have graduated.
When will I hear the good news?

00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:46.700
Do you have a plan?

00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:48.233
You’re talking nonsense.

00:12:48.233 --> 00:12:49.700
- What?
- What plan?

00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:51.700
Take our photo. Make it nice.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.000
All right.

00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:56.933
Many years flew by.

00:12:57.433 --> 00:13:01.200
We never talked about what we were.

00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:05.233
Our relationship was never clear,
Aoy and Chod.

00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:15.300
(February 2020)

00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:25.100
Sandy.

00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:29.033
Tan, you scared me.

00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:32.733
Why are you so late?

00:13:32.866 --> 00:13:35.333
I waited for a long time.
I finished my work quickly.

00:13:36.633 --> 00:13:38.133
Happy Valentine’s Day.

00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:47.133
I’m sorry for being late.

00:13:47.833 --> 00:13:49.066
I was trying to find you a rose.

00:13:49.733 --> 00:13:50.733
That’s why I was late.

00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:52.700
Thank you.

00:13:57.300 --> 00:14:00.600
That was the first Valentine’s Day
he ever did that.

00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:03.600
The first time he gave me a card,

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.000
it said...

00:14:05.466 --> 00:14:07.066
"I feel good when I am with you."

00:14:07.333 --> 00:14:09.466
"Thank you for being in my life."

00:14:10.966 --> 00:14:13.033
I feel good when I am with you too.

00:14:13.333 --> 00:14:14.466
Thank you

00:14:14.933 --> 00:14:17.300
for always taking care of me.

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:19.766
I'm happy

00:14:20.266 --> 00:14:22.033
to have you in my life.

00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:26.500
Come here.

00:14:29.533 --> 00:14:31.100
Thank you

00:14:31.633 --> 00:14:33.000
for being in my life.

00:14:33.966 --> 00:14:37.066
Thank you so much, my good girl.

00:14:38.633 --> 00:14:40.866
Wait, there's one more thing.

00:14:44.933 --> 00:14:45.933
Your gift.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:58.100
An hourglass?

00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:00.366
Your real name means sand.

00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:01.933
When I saw it,

00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:03.766
it made me think of you.

00:15:07.966 --> 00:15:08.966
You don’t like it?

00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:10.800
I do.

00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:16.500
Tan continued to treat me that way

00:15:16.866 --> 00:15:18.900
all the way into the tenth year
of knowing each other.

00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:21.300
He gave me a gift and a card

00:15:21.666 --> 00:15:24.633
that said how he felt about me

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:26.466
on every special occasion.

00:15:27.433 --> 00:15:30.466
All he lacked was a clear, verbal
confirmation of who I was to him.

00:15:32.066 --> 00:15:33.066
And...

00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:36.366
Is there anything else
you’d like to tell me?

00:15:38.266 --> 00:15:39.266
No.

00:15:41.966 --> 00:15:43.533
Why? What's wrong?

00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:46.700
Nothing.

00:15:48.566 --> 00:15:52.033
They say it takes time
to truly get to know someone.

00:15:52.666 --> 00:15:54.666
So I should be able to wait, right?

00:15:59.133 --> 00:16:00.400
- Come look at this.
- Okay.

00:16:00.766 --> 00:16:03.033
Here, I think
the lighting’s too low.

00:16:03.533 --> 00:16:05.266
- I want it to be darker.
- Sure.

00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:06.300
Please recheck it.

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:09.033
Tan.

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:10.833
Is this dress color okay
for the next shoot?

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:12.600
Yes, it suits the model.

00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:14.800
Please iron it.

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:17.433
Are you ready?

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:19.100
Tan.

00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:21.900
I checked on the model.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.500
She’s getting dressed
and almost ready.

00:16:23.666 --> 00:16:28.100
Okay, how’s the model?
I’ve never worked with her before.

00:16:28.466 --> 00:16:31.533
Based on her profile,
she seems okay.

00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:34.400
She’s a rising star,
and she’s quite busy.

00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:37.733
She looks like an easy person
to work with.

00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:39.200
Don't worry.

00:16:39.933 --> 00:16:41.000
Good job.

00:16:42.233 --> 00:16:43.700
You look worried.

00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:44.900
What's wrong?

00:16:45.133 --> 00:16:47.933
You’re an award-winning
photographer.

00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:49.833
There’s nothing to worry about.

00:16:49.833 --> 00:16:51.100
That’s enough.

00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:53.066
This is easy.

00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:56.700
I’ll go check on other things.

00:16:57.033 --> 00:16:58.966
- We’re running late.
- Okay.

00:17:00.233 --> 00:17:01.533
- Are we ready?
- Yes.

00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:08.033
Are you still not ready?

00:17:14.366 --> 00:17:15.433
It’s getting really late.

00:17:23.633 --> 00:17:24.633
Hello.

00:17:25.633 --> 00:17:26.933
I’m sorry we kept you waiting.

00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:29.733
I wanted to make sure
everything was okay,

00:17:30.233 --> 00:17:32.066
so your photos
would look their best.

00:17:34.133 --> 00:17:36.000
Do you want me to photograph
a beautiful model

00:17:36.366 --> 00:17:37.633
with a bad set?

00:17:37.833 --> 00:17:39.133
That would be a waste.

00:17:39.966 --> 00:17:42.000
- Okay.
- I’m Tan.

00:17:42.633 --> 00:17:44.766
Nice to meet you, Miss April.

00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:47.800
Call me April.

00:17:48.466 --> 00:17:49.600
No need to be formal.

00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:52.300
Okay.

00:17:55.233 --> 00:17:57.433
Did you prepare the set on your own?

00:17:58.700 --> 00:17:59.700
Your shirt is all stained.

00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:10.500
Are you ready?

00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:13.900
I was about to go get you.
I’m sorry.

00:18:14.266 --> 00:18:16.500
- No worries, but we should hurry.
- Okay.

00:18:16.766 --> 00:18:18.333
- So it won’t get even later.
- Yes.

00:18:18.466 --> 00:18:19.600
- Let's get started.
- Okay.

00:18:19.933 --> 00:18:21.100
Tan.

00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:22.666
Please check on April.

00:18:23.333 --> 00:18:25.100
It will be as we discussed.

00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:27.100
It's good.

00:18:27.333 --> 00:18:28.700
- You checked?
- Yes.

00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:30.800
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

00:18:31.166 --> 00:18:32.333
Let's get started.

00:18:32.866 --> 00:18:34.633
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:36.166
- How ready?
- So ready.

00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:38.066
How ready?

00:18:38.333 --> 00:18:40.266
Let's get started, everyone.

00:18:40.966 --> 00:18:42.333
Get ready.

00:18:42.766 --> 00:18:46.433
We're starting now.
Bring your energy.

00:18:47.533 --> 00:18:48.533
Good.

00:18:51.033 --> 00:18:52.033
Get ready.

00:18:52.433 --> 00:18:53.433
One, two.

00:18:54.333 --> 00:18:55.333
Turn to the other side.

00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:56.866
Nice.

00:18:59.233 --> 00:19:00.233
I'll do a zoom-in shot.

00:19:02.333 --> 00:19:03.433
Good, don't move.

00:19:04.566 --> 00:19:06.133
The stylist did an amazing job.

00:19:07.266 --> 00:19:08.933
That's good.

00:19:09.066 --> 00:19:10.900
Don't move. This is great.

00:19:11.033 --> 00:19:12.100
Are you two together?

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:16.400
What?

00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:18.700
Are you two together?

00:19:22.333 --> 00:19:25.400
Sandy was a junior at school.

00:19:27.366 --> 00:19:30.700
April, I'd like to try something.

00:19:37.766 --> 00:19:40.400
Please touch the fabric here,

00:19:42.366 --> 00:19:43.500
and look at your hand

00:19:43.933 --> 00:19:46.533
as if you’re expressing that

00:19:46.833 --> 00:19:48.733
you’re in love with someone.

00:19:49.533 --> 00:19:50.633
Like this?

00:19:50.766 --> 00:19:51.766
Yes.

00:19:57.566 --> 00:19:58.566
Like this?

00:20:27.966 --> 00:20:28.966
I'm sorry.

00:20:29.933 --> 00:20:30.933
I...

00:20:32.266 --> 00:20:33.266
Okay.

00:20:41.466 --> 00:20:43.500
Let's try it again.

00:20:48.066 --> 00:20:50.700
Are you ready? One, two.

00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:52.600
Good.

00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:56.566
Isn't that a little too close?

00:20:58.033 --> 00:21:00.300
Let me check the photo.

00:21:27.366 --> 00:21:29.766
Download the photos
and send them to me. I’ll get going.

00:21:29.966 --> 00:21:31.033
- Thank you.
- See you.

00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:41.800
They seemed happy with your work
and couldn’t stop complimenting you.

00:21:42.866 --> 00:21:43.866
Really?

00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:47.366
But I didn’t like what April did.

00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:49.100
What did she do?

00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:52.800
Kissed me?

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:55.000
It's nothing.

00:21:55.700 --> 00:21:57.966
She’s mixed.
She probably thinks it’s normal.

00:21:59.066 --> 00:22:00.866
She probably just wanted
to mess with me.

00:22:01.966 --> 00:22:05.900
What if a male model kissed
a female photographer just for fun?

00:22:06.866 --> 00:22:09.733
I’m a guy. It means nothing.

00:22:14.866 --> 00:22:16.833
You're just going to
let her do that to you?

00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:20.400
Come on,
what do you expect me to do?

00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:23.900
You want me to criticize her
and ruin the atmosphere?

00:22:24.033 --> 00:22:26.033
I don’t want to cause any trouble.

00:22:27.433 --> 00:22:28.433
I have to go.

00:22:29.300 --> 00:22:30.400
Wait.

00:22:31.966 --> 00:22:32.966
Why are you mad?

00:22:34.333 --> 00:22:35.333
I’m not.

00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:37.100
I’m just tired.

00:23:01.366 --> 00:23:02.700
Yes, Aoy and Chod.

00:23:03.366 --> 00:23:05.066
What right did I have
to be mad at him?

00:23:05.733 --> 00:23:07.266
We weren’t together.

00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:11.933
(Tan)

00:23:14.866 --> 00:23:16.833
(Tan)

00:23:24.833 --> 00:23:26.866
I know you’re in there.

00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:29.500
Why didn’t you answer
my calls last night?

00:23:30.066 --> 00:23:31.266
Are you mad at me?

00:23:48.166 --> 00:23:50.500
Sandy.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:52.766
- Hey!
- Sandy.

00:23:53.433 --> 00:23:57.266
Why did you just come in?
Why didn’t you call me first?

00:23:57.433 --> 00:23:59.600
I'm sorry.

00:23:59.933 --> 00:24:03.366
Why didn’t you answer my calls?

00:24:03.533 --> 00:24:05.033
I knocked on the door,
but you didn’t open.

00:24:05.333 --> 00:24:07.066
I was in the shower.

00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:10.800
Why are you here?

00:24:12.733 --> 00:24:14.233
Why are you mad at me?

00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:17.333
No, I'm not mad.

00:24:17.866 --> 00:24:19.000
I'm fine.

00:24:19.133 --> 00:24:20.133
You're lying.

00:24:20.533 --> 00:24:22.033
- I bought pizza.
- Tan!

00:24:26.966 --> 00:24:27.966
Fine.

00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:30.100
Do you want to eat or not?

00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:35.000
Yes or no?

00:24:36.866 --> 00:24:38.033
- I'll leave then.
- I'll eat it.

00:24:39.066 --> 00:24:40.066
See?

00:24:40.333 --> 00:24:42.766
- Tan.
- I saw you.

00:24:46.533 --> 00:24:48.433
Let me get dressed first.

00:24:49.066 --> 00:24:50.200
Don't start without me.

00:24:50.933 --> 00:24:51.933
Hurry up.

00:25:01.966 --> 00:25:04.133
He always did this, Aoy and Chod.

00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:06.966
He knows how to make it up to me,

00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:10.266
and would spend
the whole day with me

00:25:10.666 --> 00:25:12.933
until he was sure I felt better.

00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:16.266
If he didn’t have feelings for me,

00:25:16.666 --> 00:25:19.233
he wouldn’t have paid
so much attention to me, right?

00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:33.600
Hey.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:36.033
Oh...

00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:38.000
It’s late.
Why didn’t you wake me up?

00:26:38.466 --> 00:26:41.800
You were sleeping so peacefully.
I didn’t want to disturb you.

00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:45.600
Then...

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.366
I'll get going.

00:27:06.833 --> 00:27:07.833
Thanks.

00:27:08.366 --> 00:27:09.866
Thank you for keeping me company.

00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:11.800
Sure.

00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:13.200
Bye.

00:27:16.366 --> 00:27:17.366
Tan.

00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:18.900
Yes?

00:27:32.633 --> 00:27:35.000
We’ve known each other
for almost ten years now.

00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:39.400
Is there anything
you’d like to tell me?

00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:49.700
I...

00:27:51.933 --> 00:27:53.200
I want to let you know...

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:57.000
I...

00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:05.500
Thank you

00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:08.366
for always being by my side.

00:28:11.566 --> 00:28:13.700
You’re always so good to me.

00:28:14.300 --> 00:28:15.733
You help me with everything.

00:28:16.366 --> 00:28:18.766
I wouldn’t be here without you.

00:28:20.866 --> 00:28:22.566
That’s all you wanted to tell me?

00:28:23.266 --> 00:28:24.266
Yes.

00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:27.300
What about you?

00:28:31.066 --> 00:28:32.800
Is there anything
you’d like to tell me?

00:28:40.066 --> 00:28:41.466
I want to tell you...

00:28:48.966 --> 00:28:50.600
Thank you.

00:28:58.866 --> 00:28:59.866
Okay.

00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:02.166
I'll get going then.

00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:05.100
Don't sleep too late.

00:29:55.333 --> 00:29:57.300
- Hello.
- This is April.

00:29:58.300 --> 00:29:59.300
April?

00:29:59.733 --> 00:30:00.733
Yes.

00:30:00.733 --> 00:30:03.166
You might want to save my number,

00:30:03.266 --> 00:30:05.966
because we’ll be talking
on the phone more.

00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:09.700
I’m thinking of shooting
a photo book.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:11.966
I’m not sure if you’re up for it.

00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:13.900
I really like

00:30:14.166 --> 00:30:17.000
the photos you took
at the photoshoot.

00:30:17.133 --> 00:30:21.466
So I thought if you shoot
the photo book for me,

00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:25.633
my model friends
will be killing over you.

00:30:27.233 --> 00:30:28.233
Well...

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:30.000
Sure.

00:30:31.766 --> 00:30:32.766
I...

00:30:34.133 --> 00:30:36.900
Let’s meet to discuss the details.

00:30:37.466 --> 00:30:39.000
Where would you like to meet?

00:30:39.466 --> 00:30:40.466
My place.

00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:45.700
The photoshoot will take place
at my place anyway.

00:30:45.766 --> 00:30:49.033
You might want
to check out the location.

00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:50.533
Is that okay with you?

00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:06.800
Hello, April.

00:31:08.133 --> 00:31:09.133
Hello.

00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:14.500
If you wanted a drink,
we could’ve had one at my place.

00:31:14.633 --> 00:31:15.633
We didn’t have to come here.

00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:18.533
I didn’t want
to invade your privacy.

00:31:18.700 --> 00:31:21.233
We can discuss work here.

00:31:21.700 --> 00:31:24.666
Don’t want to invade my privacy,
or is it out of respect for someone?

00:31:27.233 --> 00:31:28.233
No.

00:31:28.433 --> 00:31:32.400
Let’s discuss work
and not waste your time.

00:31:32.966 --> 00:31:33.966
This way.

00:31:42.133 --> 00:31:44.133
- Have a drink with me.
- It’s fine, thank you.

00:31:44.300 --> 00:31:45.666
Be a gentleman.

00:31:47.366 --> 00:31:48.366
Thank you.

00:31:59.266 --> 00:32:01.866
You only want to discuss work.

00:32:02.166 --> 00:32:04.866
I want to talk about other things,
so I can get to know you better.

00:32:05.166 --> 00:32:06.366
When we work together,

00:32:07.033 --> 00:32:08.133
I’ll know what you like.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:14.800
That's enough.

00:32:17.100 --> 00:32:18.100
I’m feeling pretty tipsy.

00:32:19.733 --> 00:32:20.733
Thank you.

00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:32.633
Are you really still single?

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:37.000
I’m not in a rush.

00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:39.100
You’re 30 now.

00:32:39.533 --> 00:32:41.766
When do you plan
on having a girlfriend?

00:32:44.700 --> 00:32:45.700
April.

00:32:46.266 --> 00:32:47.900
Were you looking at my ID?

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:52.566
My parents got married
after dating for only a short while.

00:32:52.966 --> 00:32:55.533
They ended up getting divorced.

00:32:55.866 --> 00:32:56.900
They had issues.

00:32:57.600 --> 00:32:58.900
It made me feel like

00:32:59.866 --> 00:33:03.133
I should take my time
to get to know someone.

00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:05.366
But I think

00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:09.266
Sandy likes you.

00:33:11.533 --> 00:33:13.633
You’re making things up, April.

00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:16.000
Sandy and I

00:33:17.333 --> 00:33:18.466
are just friends.

00:33:32.766 --> 00:33:33.766
Tanwa.

00:33:39.866 --> 00:33:41.166
Someone who’s just a friend

00:33:42.166 --> 00:33:44.133
doesn’t know you that well.

00:33:48.666 --> 00:33:49.666
If...

00:33:50.900 --> 00:33:51.900
You say

00:33:52.566 --> 00:33:53.833
you’re single,

00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:56.900
but I really think Sandy likes you.

00:33:57.300 --> 00:33:59.600
If you keep her waiting,

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:03.133
then maybe
she’s not the one for you.

00:34:10.166 --> 00:34:12.133
Can I say something?

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:14.000
Sure.

00:34:15.366 --> 00:34:16.366
Well...

00:34:17.766 --> 00:34:19.300
You don’t have a crush on anyone.

00:34:19.866 --> 00:34:20.966
I like you.

00:34:22.866 --> 00:34:24.300
After we kissed that day,

00:34:25.366 --> 00:34:27.200
I couldn’t stop thinking about you.

00:34:29.900 --> 00:34:30.933
Should we date?

00:34:32.500 --> 00:34:33.500
Excuse me?

00:34:34.533 --> 00:34:35.866
I’m an easygoing person.

00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:38.766
If we’re not compatible,
we can just go our separate ways

00:34:39.233 --> 00:34:40.233
and not waste time.

00:34:41.566 --> 00:34:42.566
Well...

00:34:46.933 --> 00:34:47.933
April.

00:34:48.366 --> 00:34:50.466
You’re really drunk.

00:34:52.300 --> 00:34:53.300
I'm not.

00:34:53.833 --> 00:34:55.233
I meant

00:34:56.900 --> 00:34:58.033
everything I said.

00:35:00.100 --> 00:35:01.100
I...

00:35:04.700 --> 00:35:06.233
April, no.

00:35:07.366 --> 00:35:10.700
I’m sorry, I...

00:35:12.433 --> 00:35:15.966
I don’t have feelings for you.

00:35:16.033 --> 00:35:18.766
I’m sorry. I have to go.

00:35:18.766 --> 00:35:22.100
If you have any more ideas,

00:35:22.633 --> 00:35:23.666
you can call me.

00:35:24.266 --> 00:35:25.333
Please excuse me.

00:35:25.900 --> 00:35:27.033
Thank you.

00:35:49.900 --> 00:35:51.533
(April)

00:36:00.566 --> 00:36:01.566
Hello.

00:36:02.300 --> 00:36:03.533
Are you Sandy?

00:36:04.100 --> 00:36:05.266
I'm April.

00:36:05.333 --> 00:36:07.900
I can't get a hold of Tanwa,

00:36:08.033 --> 00:36:11.666
and I wanted to talk to him
about what we discussed last night.

00:36:12.100 --> 00:36:13.100
Last night?

00:36:13.733 --> 00:36:14.733
What about?

00:36:14.966 --> 00:36:17.300
I got a little drunk last night.

00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:19.400
Tanwa didn’t try to stop me.

00:36:19.466 --> 00:36:22.433
I don’t remember
what happened last night.

00:36:23.266 --> 00:36:24.966
And why are you calling me?

00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:27.600
About shooting
the photo book at my place.

00:36:28.166 --> 00:36:29.166
So...

00:36:29.566 --> 00:36:32.166
Tanwa didn’t tell you anything?

00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:33.800
Then it's fine.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.133
I’ll wait for him to call me back.

00:36:36.433 --> 00:36:37.433
Thank you.

00:36:50.066 --> 00:36:51.833
Sandy, did you wait long?

00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:55.833
The traffic’s really bad.
Let’s go eat.

00:36:56.733 --> 00:36:57.966
Where were you last night?

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:02.033
You went to see April, didn’t you?

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.800
Yes. How did you know?

00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:11.400
April has a gig for us,

00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:13.233
so I went out
to discuss it with her.

00:37:13.566 --> 00:37:14.933
I was going to tell you today.

00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:17.400
Why didn’t you ask me
to go with you?

00:37:17.833 --> 00:37:19.600
We always discuss work together.

00:37:19.966 --> 00:37:23.833
Come on, Sandy.
I know you don’t like her.

00:37:24.166 --> 00:37:26.500
I just went to do a first screening.

00:37:26.833 --> 00:37:28.700
This is the first time
you didn’t tell me about it.

00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:31.500
You like her, don’t you?

00:37:31.866 --> 00:37:33.733
Come on, Sandy.

00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:36.000
That’s why you were okay
when she kissed you.

00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:38.400
Hey, come on.

00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:40.300
Be reasonable.

00:37:40.533 --> 00:37:42.266
We’ve known each other
for ten years now.

00:37:42.500 --> 00:37:44.266
You still don’t know
what kind of person I am?

00:37:44.600 --> 00:37:47.366
That’s because you’ve never acted
like this in ten years.

00:37:48.166 --> 00:37:50.433
She kissed you and flirted with you.

00:37:50.600 --> 00:37:53.666
She asked you out late at night
and you agreed to it.

00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:55.600
You slept with her, didn’t you?

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:57.800
She said she got drunk
and couldn’t remember.

00:37:57.933 --> 00:38:00.666
Sandy, don’t be ridiculous.
We’re adults.

00:38:00.733 --> 00:38:02.000
You’re the one being ridiculous.

00:38:02.466 --> 00:38:04.766
You never understand how I feel.

00:38:05.066 --> 00:38:07.000
Nearly ten years now...
what was all of that?

00:38:09.100 --> 00:38:10.533
I showed you everything.

00:38:10.900 --> 00:38:12.000
Tell me.

00:38:12.500 --> 00:38:14.200
What am I to you?

00:38:20.833 --> 00:38:21.933
You’re not going to say it, right?

00:38:22.333 --> 00:38:23.700
Then don’t say it.

00:38:24.366 --> 00:38:25.366
I understand.

00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:48.400
Nearly ten years now...
what was all of that?

00:38:48.466 --> 00:38:49.666
Tell me.

00:38:49.833 --> 00:38:51.566
What am I to you?

00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:05.600
(April)

00:39:14.466 --> 00:39:15.466
Yes, April?

00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:17.766
I don’t know what’s wrong
with the signal.

00:39:17.766 --> 00:39:20.300
I tried to call you,
but I couldn’t reach you,

00:39:20.633 --> 00:39:22.266
so I called Sandy.

00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:25.500
She already told me about it.

00:39:25.900 --> 00:39:28.833
Really? She called you?

00:39:29.300 --> 00:39:34.300
I didn’t know you didn’t tell her
about our meeting last night.

00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:37.800
I didn’t cause any trouble, did I?

00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:42.800
Everything’s fine.

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:45.300
Why did you call me?

00:39:45.700 --> 00:39:47.000
It’s not important.

00:39:47.733 --> 00:39:50.300
I’m throwing a party
at my place tonight,

00:39:50.466 --> 00:39:51.500
and I’d like to invite you.

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:54.333
I...

00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:57.833
There won’t just be
my model friends,

00:39:58.200 --> 00:40:02.466
but many important people
in the fashion industry.

00:40:02.700 --> 00:40:05.033
If you get to know them,

00:40:05.533 --> 00:40:07.933
it’ll benefit you.

00:40:08.633 --> 00:40:12.133
A chance like this
doesn’t come by often.

00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:14.766
I can introduce you to them.

00:40:16.700 --> 00:40:17.700
Well...

00:40:30.333 --> 00:40:31.333
Sure.

00:40:31.633 --> 00:40:34.400
See you tonight.

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:37.366
Let’s party through the night.

00:40:37.666 --> 00:40:40.900
I can’t stay late though.

00:40:41.300 --> 00:40:42.900
I’ll send you the location.

00:40:43.566 --> 00:40:44.566
See you soon.

00:41:04.466 --> 00:41:06.766
Cheers, everyone.

00:41:56.800 --> 00:41:58.900
It's getting late. I have to go.

00:41:59.100 --> 00:42:01.066
Tanwa's leaving now.

00:42:01.166 --> 00:42:03.333
What?

00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:05.866
Come on, stay longer.

00:42:05.866 --> 00:42:07.433
One last drink.

00:42:07.433 --> 00:42:09.233
Bottoms up.

00:42:20.700 --> 00:42:22.700
It's getting late. I have to go.

00:42:23.633 --> 00:42:25.066
Is someone waiting for you at home?

00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:27.600
Sandy?

00:42:30.533 --> 00:42:31.700
I don't understand.

00:42:33.066 --> 00:42:35.833
That woman is of no use
in your life at all.

00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:38.600
She doesn’t even love you that much.

00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:41.600
Right?

00:42:42.233 --> 00:42:45.200
If she did, she would’ve already
asked to be your girlfriend by now.

00:42:46.066 --> 00:42:47.100
You too.

00:42:48.300 --> 00:42:50.733
What are you trying to prove?

00:42:52.066 --> 00:42:54.000
You're drunk, April.

00:42:54.333 --> 00:42:56.900
I should get going.

00:42:57.833 --> 00:42:59.400
The person you should be
paying attention to

00:43:00.500 --> 00:43:01.933
is me.

00:43:02.500 --> 00:43:04.033
Look at the guests here.

00:43:05.233 --> 00:43:07.700
That’s the future waiting for you.

00:43:08.300 --> 00:43:10.433
Don’t waste your time.

00:43:16.233 --> 00:43:17.233
April.

00:43:19.566 --> 00:43:22.100
I should go. You're wasted.

00:43:22.100 --> 00:43:23.566
Don't say no to me.

00:43:23.700 --> 00:43:25.533
A talented photographer like you

00:43:26.400 --> 00:43:29.733
belongs with a well‑connected model
like me.

00:43:30.566 --> 00:43:33.166
Why wait for someone
who doesn’t deserve you?

00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:37.233
Don't.

00:43:38.033 --> 00:43:39.433
Someone might see us.

00:43:39.633 --> 00:43:41.200
I don't think it's a good idea.

00:43:54.066 --> 00:43:55.466
You're drunk.

00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:57.600
I'm glad I'm drunk.

00:43:58.600 --> 00:44:00.833
So you will be the happiest with me.

00:44:57.500 --> 00:45:03.100
(Reminder: Sandy's Birthday)

00:45:03.766 --> 00:45:05.933
(Reminder: Sandy's Birthday)

00:45:17.633 --> 00:45:19.700
They won’t let you get any closer,

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:21.933
but you can’t walk away either.

00:45:22.300 --> 00:45:25.166
Or maybe they don't want to lose
a good person but don’t love you?

00:45:26.633 --> 00:45:27.866
- Oh no.
- Be careful.

00:45:28.133 --> 00:45:29.300
- Here.
- Thank you.

00:45:29.400 --> 00:45:30.700
Don’t bother next time.

00:45:30.766 --> 00:45:32.366
I thought you two were a couple,

00:45:32.366 --> 00:45:33.733
but Tanwa denied it.

00:45:33.866 --> 00:45:35.900
The longer a woman waits,
the older she gets.

00:45:35.966 --> 00:45:37.266
And it will be hard
to find a good guy.

00:45:38.466 --> 00:45:39.633
What are you doing?

00:45:39.900 --> 00:45:41.200
I want the polaroid.

00:45:41.466 --> 00:45:43.033
It’s in my bedroom.
Can you get it for me?

00:45:44.366 --> 00:45:45.366
What are these?

00:45:48.333 --> 00:45:49.766
I don’t want to waste any more time.

00:45:49.900 --> 00:45:51.100
What’s gotten into you?

00:45:51.200 --> 00:45:54.933
After ten years,
I want to know who I am to you.

00:45:56.333 --> 00:45:58.100
The 148th take.

00:45:58.233 --> 00:45:59.800
Let's change the actor.

00:46:00.400 --> 00:46:01.766
You've never acted this way.

00:46:01.766 --> 00:46:03.866
She asked you out late at night

00:46:03.866 --> 00:46:05.900
- and you agreed to it.
- Cut.

00:46:06.166 --> 00:46:08.100
Show the monitor.

00:46:08.233 --> 00:46:09.666
Your phone.

00:46:09.733 --> 00:46:11.466
Me?

00:46:11.600 --> 00:46:13.233
Do it again.

00:46:14.600 --> 00:46:15.600
Wow.

00:46:16.300 --> 00:46:17.666
Show them.

00:46:20.366 --> 00:46:22.233
- Cut.
- Let's get changed.

00:46:24.133 --> 00:46:26.433
Many more scenes to go.
