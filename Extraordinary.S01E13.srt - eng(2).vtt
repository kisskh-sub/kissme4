00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:07.560
So bitter...

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:09.680
Drink it all while it's hot.

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:13.840
Even the Princess fears bitterness?

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:22.200
I've got a surprise for you.

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:23.400
Wait for me.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:25.400
I...

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:17.719
Son...

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:19.879
Aren't you making medicine?

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:21.400
What are you tinkering with here?

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.080
The medicine still needs time.

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:25.240
Father.

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:26.719
Here, try this.

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:37.520
Come on, have a taste.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:38.680
W-what is this?

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.879
My new invention. Try it.

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:51.520
Maybe add more sugar?

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:54.520
You don't get this mutual sweetness.

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:57.400
Son...

00:02:58.479 --> 00:03:00.680
Tell me, am I really getting old?

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.719
Why is it when you talk,

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.159
I understand you less and less?

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.280
That's called a generation gap.

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:10.240
What? What gap?

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.560
Let me try.

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.159
Herbal medicine is bitter.

00:03:23.719 --> 00:03:25.000
Maybe it does need more sugar.

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.120
Can I skip drinking it?

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:07.599
This medicine is too bitter.

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.959
If you keep sulking like this,

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:18.839
your illness will get worse.

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:25.560
This isn't the same medicine.

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.959
This is bubble tea—fragrant and sweet.

00:04:29.279 --> 00:04:32.079
Is this the surprise you mentioned?

00:04:34.439 --> 00:04:35.079
Try it quickly.

00:04:40.079 --> 00:04:40.839
So sweet!

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:42.040
See, I wasn't lying.

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:56.040
Does it taste good?

00:04:58.879 --> 00:04:59.639
After you finish this,

00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:00.879
you have to drink the medicine.

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:11.319
Young Duke.

00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:13.199
Miss Ziyan sent this.

00:05:15.079 --> 00:05:16.480
I shouldn't have hidden it from you.

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:18.399
I couldn't get the medicine.

00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:19.920
What happened?

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:21.720
I overheard...

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:23.199
The Four Great Medicine Merchants said

00:05:23.439 --> 00:05:25.000
they won't sell us any medicine.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.560
We'll deal with these deadwood sooner or later.

00:05:30.399 --> 00:05:32.319
Young Duke, but we have no medicine.

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:33.480
What should we do?

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:37.519
Relief herbs on slopes,

00:05:38.079 --> 00:05:39.680
damp herbs in marshlands,

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:41.959
tonics in valleys,

00:05:42.399 --> 00:05:44.160
vines in deep woods.

00:05:45.319 --> 00:05:45.800
Perfect.

00:05:46.879 --> 00:05:48.639
Fresh ones work even better.

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:50.560
This...

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:58.160
Your Majesty.

00:05:58.399 --> 00:06:00.040
Young Duke Shi sent word.

00:06:00.439 --> 00:06:03.439
There are no new epidemic cases now.

00:06:04.439 --> 00:06:05.720
Still no reason given?

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:10.639
How is the Princess?

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:14.120
After taking Young Duke Shi's medicine,

00:06:14.399 --> 00:06:16.600
her symptoms have eased.

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:17.680
That's wonderful.

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:19.680
Quick, prepare to go to the Duke's Mansion.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:20.560
Yes.

00:06:28.439 --> 00:06:28.920
Your Majesty.

00:06:29.279 --> 00:06:29.759
Young Duke.

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:31.160
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

00:06:35.879 --> 00:06:36.399
Your Majesty.

00:06:37.399 --> 00:06:38.040
Standing here,

00:06:38.199 --> 00:06:39.199
I can't work well.

00:06:39.439 --> 00:06:40.639
You should check on the Princess.

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.279
The Princess is resting.

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:46.120
The medicine depends on this.

00:06:48.079 --> 00:06:48.720
To answer Your Majesty,

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:49.600
yes.

00:06:54.199 --> 00:06:55.040
How long will it take?

00:06:56.399 --> 00:06:57.160
Before tomorrow.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:00.480
Your Majesty.

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:02.720
Tomorrow, just wait for our Young Duke

00:07:02.879 --> 00:07:04.519
to witness a miracle.

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:33.079
Young Duke.

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:35.360
Can this really cure illness?

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:36.959
Not yet.

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:38.759
But it's more than halfway there.

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:40.519
In theory,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.560
it could already be used to treat illness.

00:07:42.839 --> 00:07:44.000
But it's better if it crystallizes.

00:07:44.519 --> 00:07:45.480
Crystals?

00:07:48.439 --> 00:07:50.800
So what do we do next?

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:55.079
Now, we just have to wait.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:56.519
Wait...

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:04.040
Wait for me, Young Duke!

00:08:48.759 --> 00:08:49.360
Young Duke.

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:50.879
Young Duke! Young Duke!

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:52.039
Young Duke.

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:53.399
Wake up, Young Duke!

00:08:53.759 --> 00:08:54.639
Young Duke.

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:56.759
Young Duke.

00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:59.159
Young Duke, something's wrong!

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:01.080
The medicine was stolen!

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:02.279
Young Duke.

00:09:02.679 --> 00:09:03.759
Young Duke, bad news!

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.360
The Princess has purple spots on her hand.

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:07.799
Young Duke.

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:12.039
Young Duke, where are you going?

00:09:12.559 --> 00:09:13.240
To save someone.

00:09:15.519 --> 00:09:16.639
I have no medicine!

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:18.559
Young Duke.

00:09:18.919 --> 00:09:20.000
Wasn't the medicine stolen?

00:09:20.799 --> 00:09:22.159
This is called "learn from mistakes."

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:31.919
Your Majesty.

00:09:34.879 --> 00:09:36.279
Hurry and treat the Princess!

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:37.879
Your Majesty.

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:40.519
I wish to speak with you alone.

00:09:42.279 --> 00:09:42.759
Safe and sound.

00:09:43.639 --> 00:09:45.080
Then I'll take the medicine box.

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:53.720
This is utter nonsense.

00:09:59.919 --> 00:10:01.600
Your Majesty, everything is ready.

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:02.799
I will go in now.

00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:03.919
Go in soon.

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:05.080
Know what to say

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:06.360
and what not to say.

00:10:08.559 --> 00:10:09.120
Wait a moment.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.240
Let me check first.

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:18.399
Fan'er...

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:21.840
What could be said about curing illness

00:10:21.919 --> 00:10:23.200
that can't be spoken?

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:27.720
Father, it's best you don't know.

00:10:37.159 --> 00:10:38.919
If word of this gets out,

00:10:39.159 --> 00:10:40.360
I will exterminate your entire clan.

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:42.399
Your Shi family will never rise again.

00:10:43.039 --> 00:10:43.720
Rest assured, Your Majesty.

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:45.120
It had better be.

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:23.919
This batch of medicine

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:25.200
has already been prepared differently.

00:11:25.759 --> 00:11:26.440
I guarantee it's not bitter.

00:11:38.759 --> 00:11:39.320
Not bitter, right?

00:11:51.879 --> 00:11:53.200
Next,

00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:55.519
explain to the Princess first.

00:11:58.279 --> 00:11:59.080
We...

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:00.639
We...

00:12:01.159 --> 00:12:01.799
Don't worry, Princess.

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:02.639
I'm definitely not

00:12:02.759 --> 00:12:04.000
someone who takes advantage of others.

00:12:04.399 --> 00:12:04.960
I...

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.679
I trust your character.

00:12:08.759 --> 00:12:09.679
It's just...

00:12:58.799 --> 00:13:00.200
I cannot see what is in front of me.

00:13:01.399 --> 00:13:02.559
I ask the Princess for forgiveness.

00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:38.639
Your Majesty

00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:40.639
I have finished treating the Princess.

00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:42.559
What are you doing?

00:14:46.279 --> 00:14:47.399
My reputation is not good.

00:14:47.879 --> 00:14:49.200
The Princess is of noble birth.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.159
So I had to treat the Princess blindfolded.

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:53.679
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

00:14:54.799 --> 00:14:56.080
You have thought of everything.

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:02.360
I didn't expect he would actually make it.

00:15:03.039 --> 00:15:05.120
Luckily, I had a backup plan.

00:15:06.159 --> 00:15:07.919
Now the medicine is in our hands.

00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:10.639
Let's see how he saves anyone now.

00:15:11.919 --> 00:15:12.919
Prince Qing is right.

00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:17.559
When we see Your Majesty soon,

00:15:18.399 --> 00:15:21.159
say I funded your research.

00:15:21.399 --> 00:15:22.799
Do not give yourself away.

00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:23.559
Yes.

00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:24.879
Your Majesty

00:15:25.679 --> 00:15:27.240
The Princess has taken the medicine and is asleep.

00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:28.559
But she still needs daily treatment.

00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:30.000
I humbly ask Your Majesty

00:15:30.279 --> 00:15:31.960
to let the Princess stay and recover.

00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:33.000
I promise

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:35.320
to return a healthy Princess to Your Majesty.

00:15:37.919 --> 00:15:38.480
Your Majesty

00:15:39.799 --> 00:15:40.840
Prince Qing requests an audience.

00:15:41.519 --> 00:15:43.399
I only brought Eunuch Cao out of the palace.

00:15:43.639 --> 00:15:45.120
How does he know I am here?

00:15:45.919 --> 00:15:46.360
I will not see him.

00:15:46.639 --> 00:15:47.480
Why is he everywhere?

00:15:48.039 --> 00:15:48.960
A lingering ghost.

00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:51.440
Let him in.

00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:53.039
Yes.

00:15:53.759 --> 00:15:55.240
Your Majesty invites you in.

00:16:05.039 --> 00:16:05.639
Your Majesty

00:16:05.879 --> 00:16:06.480
Your Majesty

00:16:06.639 --> 00:16:07.799
Speak, what is it?

00:16:08.159 --> 00:16:11.000
I am very worried Shi Feifan is boasting.

00:16:11.159 --> 00:16:12.320
He may delay the Princess's recovery.

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:15.000
He does not care about the people's lives.

00:16:15.639 --> 00:16:18.600
So I sent people to seek famous doctors.

00:16:18.679 --> 00:16:19.720
After much hardship,

00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:22.320
we finally developed a cure for the epidemic.

00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:27.440
If the Princess takes this medicine,

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:29.960
she will surely recover fully.

00:16:30.519 --> 00:16:31.120
Prince Qing

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:33.399
Have you tested this medicine?

00:16:35.559 --> 00:16:36.360
Of course.
