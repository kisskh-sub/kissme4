00:03:10.545 --> 00:03:11.665
What are you doing?

00:03:12.825 --> 00:03:14.425
Applying an under-eye mask.

00:03:15.385 --> 00:03:16.445
You're already gorgeous.

00:03:17.625 --> 00:03:18.945
Where are you going, sis?

00:03:20.225 --> 00:03:21.385
Shhh!

00:03:22.565 --> 00:03:23.305
See you.

00:03:23.625 --> 00:03:24.385
Huh?

00:03:24.625 --> 00:03:25.545
I'll be going now.

00:03:31.025 --> 00:03:32.305
Where are you going this time?

00:03:33.585 --> 00:03:34.985
You dropped out

00:03:35.025 --> 00:03:36.225
and said you'd look for work.

00:03:36.425 --> 00:03:37.515
All you do is drink.

00:03:37.555 --> 00:03:38.895
I've talked to my friends.

00:03:39.525 --> 00:03:41.705
I'm going to buy
and sell secondhand clothes.

00:03:42.425 --> 00:03:43.665
Don't worry about me.

00:03:44.205 --> 00:03:46.305
Why can't you be
a good example for Cream for once?

00:03:48.065 --> 00:03:49.575
All you do is frivolous stuff.

00:03:59.865 --> 00:04:01.705
Cream and I are different, Dad.

00:04:03.385 --> 00:04:05.225
If she loves studying, then let her be.

00:04:05.865 --> 00:04:06.905
I don't.

00:04:06.945 --> 00:04:08.425
Selling secondhand goods?

00:04:09.205 --> 00:04:10.585
Sneaking out at night to drink?

for failing to be the good girl
you expect me to be.

Cheers! Cheers!

00:04:44.545 --> 00:04:46.745
Guys, you're drunk already?

00:04:48.465 --> 00:04:49.865
Your faces are all red!

I'm kidding.

- Wait, cheers!

00:05:03.085 --> 00:05:04.285
Watch your step.

00:05:07.985 --> 00:05:10.065
This way, Claire!

00:05:22.825 --> 00:05:23.985
Claire.

00:05:25.245 --> 00:05:26.245
I'm home.

00:05:28.385 --> 00:05:30.145
Aww, I'm actually craving this.

00:05:30.185 --> 00:05:31.505
Thank you.

00:05:33.105 --> 00:05:34.105
Have you had anything?

00:05:34.625 --> 00:05:35.625
I haven't, actually.

00:05:41.105 --> 00:05:42.105
Gosh.

00:05:42.465 --> 00:05:43.905
You carry these every day?

00:05:44.245 --> 00:05:45.185
Mm.

00:05:45.225 --> 00:05:47.825
Currently, I'm preparing for
the International Physics Olympiad.

00:05:47.865 --> 00:05:49.655
I've got subjects
that I'm worried I'll be behind.

00:05:49.695 --> 00:05:51.165
That's why
I'm carrying the books around.

00:05:51.645 --> 00:05:53.225
You're always like this.

00:05:53.565 --> 00:05:55.065
You said
you couldn't study them in time,

00:05:55.405 --> 00:05:57.465
but you'd always get full scores.

00:06:04.105 --> 00:06:05.105
And...

00:06:05.505 --> 00:06:07.105
You're not going to continue
your studies?

00:06:07.825 --> 00:06:08.825
Probably not.

00:06:09.825 --> 00:06:11.065
I have no knack for this.

00:06:11.865 --> 00:06:14.025
Honestly, you're a great student.

00:06:14.065 --> 00:06:15.985
You learn new things so easily,

00:06:16.125 --> 00:06:17.585
meanwhile I don't.

00:06:17.625 --> 00:06:18.785
For example?

00:06:19.345 --> 00:06:21.585
Like, riding a bicycle.

00:06:21.985 --> 00:06:24.585
It took you only an hour
to figure out how to ride it.

00:06:24.625 --> 00:06:25.865
The same goes for swimming.

00:06:26.445 --> 00:06:27.985
I think you're talented.

00:06:29.965 --> 00:06:32.345
Why are the examples
so funny-sounding?

00:06:32.385 --> 00:06:35.105
Hey! They're not.

00:06:35.385 --> 00:06:37.345
They're all survival skills.

00:06:41.985 --> 00:06:42.985
I can't hold it anymore.

00:06:45.145 --> 00:06:45.865
Hey.

00:06:45.985 --> 00:06:46.705
Hm?

00:06:47.985 --> 00:06:49.585
Do you want to know a secret?

00:06:51.985 --> 00:06:52.805
What is it?

00:06:53.705 --> 00:06:55.585
Promise me you won't tell anyone.

00:06:58.505 --> 00:06:59.505
I promise.

00:07:04.985 --> 00:07:06.985
I actually don't have any talents.

00:07:08.225 --> 00:07:10.025
I just say, "Screw it.

00:07:10.545 --> 00:07:12.025
It's okay to fail.

00:07:12.305 --> 00:07:14.105
I'll keep at it until I get there."

00:07:16.325 --> 00:07:18.825
When you're not worried
about making mistakes,

00:07:20.265 --> 00:07:21.265
you'll learn things quickly.

00:07:24.365 --> 00:07:27.385
Is the reason
you're not returning to school

00:07:27.705 --> 00:07:29.385
that you're worried
you'll do worse than me?

00:07:29.745 --> 00:07:32.145
Hey! I'm not worried about that.

00:07:32.185 --> 00:07:34.545
- Are you?
- I'm not!

00:07:39.585 --> 00:07:42.225
Let's just say that
being a good daughter

00:07:42.885 --> 00:07:44.545
is your duty, okay?

00:07:44.985 --> 00:07:46.945
As for being a nonsensical daughter,

00:07:47.505 --> 00:07:48.865
I'll take care of that.

00:07:49.505 --> 00:07:50.395
Okay?

00:07:51.765 --> 00:07:52.985
Okay, I guess.

00:07:53.225 --> 00:07:54.225
Come on, eat up.

00:07:55.545 --> 00:07:56.625
I'm starving.

00:07:56.825 --> 00:07:57.665
Let me have some of yours.

00:07:58.985 --> 00:08:00.745
My cup is almost empty.

00:08:00.785 --> 00:08:02.225
- No!
- Just a bit!

00:08:02.265 --> 00:08:03.185
I refuse!

00:08:19.905 --> 00:08:21.065
Hey, to me!

00:08:24.945 --> 00:08:25.745
There!

00:08:37.925 --> 00:08:38.925
Teacher Maed.

00:08:39.705 --> 00:08:42.305
Can you help me with
the International Physics Olympiad?

00:08:43.985 --> 00:08:45.545
I don't accept tutoring, unfortunately.

00:08:45.585 --> 00:08:46.825
It needs school permission.

00:08:47.545 --> 00:08:49.505
Please help me, Teacher.

00:08:49.545 --> 00:08:52.185
I really want a spot
by competing in the Olympiad.

00:08:56.465 --> 00:08:58.185
If the school finds out,

00:08:58.345 --> 00:08:59.465
I'll be in deep trouble.

00:09:00.145 --> 00:09:01.585
I beg you, Teacher.

00:09:02.905 --> 00:09:06.805
I'll study hard and won't let you down.

00:09:07.185 --> 00:09:08.625
Please, Teacher.

00:09:11.865 --> 00:09:12.865
Fine, I'll help.

00:09:14.025 --> 00:09:15.585
But you must not tell this to anybody,

00:09:15.625 --> 00:09:16.465
okay?

00:09:16.745 --> 00:09:17.525
Okay.

00:09:17.825 --> 00:09:18.585
Uh...

00:09:19.425 --> 00:09:22.065
What about the fee?

00:09:22.105 --> 00:09:23.345
We'll talk about it later.

00:09:23.865 --> 00:09:24.665
Yay!

00:09:25.625 --> 00:09:27.865
Thank you! Thank you so much.

00:09:27.905 --> 00:09:29.545
I'll study my heart out.

00:09:29.975 --> 00:09:30.975
Thank you.

00:09:31.185 --> 00:09:32.345
Have a good one, Teacher.

00:09:32.505 --> 00:09:33.385
Bye-bye.

00:09:43.025 --> 00:09:45.905
A mass M with volume V
is released into a deep cup of water,

00:09:45.945 --> 00:09:47.025
- right?
- Yes.

00:09:47.065 --> 00:09:49.825
It'd look like this,
with a ping-pong ball underneath.

00:09:50.745 --> 00:09:52.225
Notice that it's the same.

00:09:54.585 --> 00:09:56.505
The only difference is the latter.

00:10:03.145 --> 00:10:03.945
Great!

00:10:07.905 --> 00:10:08.785
Awesome!

00:10:10.985 --> 00:10:12.265
Have I kept you waiting?

00:10:12.305 --> 00:10:13.185
Hey, Claire!

00:10:14.135 --> 00:10:16.855
I went and got the clothes, guys.

00:10:17.065 --> 00:10:18.305
I think I can do this.

00:10:18.345 --> 00:10:19.225
Cool!

00:10:19.265 --> 00:10:20.505
Cheers!

00:10:20.545 --> 00:10:21.745
You guys are so funny.

00:10:27.425 --> 00:10:28.425
Thank you.

00:11:11.345 --> 00:11:12.745
You've gotten so much better, Cream.

00:11:14.465 --> 00:11:15.415
At this rate,

00:11:16.145 --> 00:11:17.385
you're sure to get the quota spot.

00:11:19.225 --> 00:11:20.425
Thank you, Teacher.

00:11:49.225 --> 00:11:50.345
Cream, do you know that...

00:11:52.785 --> 00:11:54.225
of all the students I've taught,

00:11:55.665 --> 00:11:57.305
you're the most beautiful.

00:11:59.305 --> 00:12:00.305
Thank you.

00:12:06.625 --> 00:12:07.785
Teacher...

00:12:08.145 --> 00:12:09.145
This is a bit too close.

00:12:18.025 --> 00:12:18.985
I've helped you.

00:12:21.705 --> 00:12:22.945
Please don't do this.

00:12:22.985 --> 00:12:24.185
Please return the favor.

00:12:37.745 --> 00:12:38.745
Stay still.

00:12:39.185 --> 00:12:40.305
Help!

00:12:42.345 --> 00:12:43.885
Help me!

00:12:45.345 --> 00:12:46.665
I told you to stay still.

00:13:33.065 --> 00:13:34.265
Get back!

00:13:42.625 --> 00:13:43.625
Go away!

00:13:49.545 --> 00:13:51.025
- Who is it?
- This song...

00:13:51.705 --> 00:13:52.905
It's Cream.

00:13:53.305 --> 00:13:54.825
- Cream?
- Who is it?

00:13:54.865 --> 00:13:56.265
Oh, it's my sister.

00:13:57.465 --> 00:13:59.985
What is it, Cream?

00:14:08.945 --> 00:14:10.785
- Hey, where are you going, Claire?
- Claire?

00:14:10.905 --> 00:14:11.825
Claire!

00:14:11.865 --> 00:14:13.065
Hello, Cream?

00:14:44.217 --> 00:14:44.917
Cream!

00:14:50.305 --> 00:14:51.145
Cream!

00:14:51.645 --> 00:14:52.545
Cream!

00:14:53.625 --> 00:14:54.625
D*mn it!

00:14:59.065 --> 00:14:59.865
Cream!

00:15:06.785 --> 00:15:07.905
Claire...

00:15:08.705 --> 00:15:09.505
Cream!

00:15:11.385 --> 00:15:12.705
Claire...

00:15:14.185 --> 00:15:16.385
I killed him.

00:15:17.905 --> 00:15:19.575
He tried to sexually assault me.

00:15:19.615 --> 00:15:21.705
I did it to defend myself.

00:15:21.745 --> 00:15:23.225
I didn't mean to do it...

00:15:23.265 --> 00:15:24.025
It's okay.

00:15:24.065 --> 00:15:25.465
I'll call the cops.

00:15:25.505 --> 00:15:26.905
Claire!

00:15:26.945 --> 00:15:29.585
Don't do it, please.

00:15:29.705 --> 00:15:30.705
Please.

00:15:30.745 --> 00:15:32.905
Don't call the police, please.

00:15:33.345 --> 00:15:34.785
Please, can we...

00:15:35.345 --> 00:15:36.625
Can we keep it a secret?

00:15:36.665 --> 00:15:39.185
I don't want anybody
to find out about this.

00:15:40.585 --> 00:15:41.405
Please?

00:15:44.905 --> 00:15:45.745
Please.

00:15:45.905 --> 00:15:48.065
He sexually assaulted me.

00:15:50.985 --> 00:15:53.265
Please, help me, Claire.

00:15:53.305 --> 00:15:55.145
Please, get me out of this.

00:16:10.825 --> 00:16:12.705
Go home without me, okay?

00:16:13.105 --> 00:16:14.745
I'll deal with this myself.

00:16:17.065 --> 00:16:18.785
What are you going to do?

00:16:29.465 --> 00:16:30.905
But you have to promise me

00:16:30.945 --> 00:16:32.785
you won't tell this to anyone,

00:16:32.825 --> 00:16:34.385
including Mom, Dad,

00:16:34.785 --> 00:16:36.785
your close friends, or anybody.

00:16:37.265 --> 00:16:38.385
Keep your lips sealed.

00:16:39.105 --> 00:16:40.105
Understood?

00:16:44.425 --> 00:16:48.225
Promise me that
this stays between us sisters.

00:16:51.985 --> 00:16:52.985
Cream!

00:16:56.665 --> 00:16:57.665
Promise?

00:17:04.585 --> 00:17:05.585
I promise.

00:17:21.225 --> 00:17:22.745
Listen to me.

00:17:24.065 --> 00:17:25.665
You're a good girl...

00:17:29.585 --> 00:17:30.945
You have a bright future ahead of you.

00:17:32.625 --> 00:17:34.545
Study hard...

00:17:39.745 --> 00:17:41.185
Make Mom and Dad proud.

00:17:42.225 --> 00:17:43.225
Understood?

00:17:50.145 --> 00:17:51.585
What are you going to do?

00:18:15.985 --> 00:18:17.385
It's time to leave.

00:18:28.185 --> 00:18:29.185
Cream.

00:18:33.665 --> 00:18:34.945
Don't forget our promise.

00:18:38.745 --> 00:18:39.985
I'll see you soon.

00:20:45.625 --> 00:20:46.625
How's it going?

00:20:52.025 --> 00:20:53.625
Are you alright? You look a bit off.

00:20:53.665 --> 00:20:55.745
The dead teacher's sister
came to talk to me.

00:20:58.145 --> 00:20:59.905
She then showed me a photo of Cream.

00:21:04.545 --> 00:21:05.745
Everyone must have known

00:21:06.145 --> 00:21:07.145
who my sister is.

00:21:09.625 --> 00:21:10.585
How did she know?

00:21:10.625 --> 00:21:12.145
I should be the one asking you.

00:21:15.545 --> 00:21:16.545
What do you mean?

00:21:16.825 --> 00:21:18.785
You're the only one
I talked to about my sister,

00:21:19.625 --> 00:21:21.865
and then it suddenly spread around.

00:21:22.385 --> 00:21:23.385
Wait.

00:21:23.665 --> 00:21:25.425
You think I spread the news about her?

00:21:25.465 --> 00:21:26.465
Then who else could it be?

00:21:27.045 --> 00:21:28.865
Not long ago, you were on the phone.

00:21:29.145 --> 00:21:29.905
Claire...

00:21:30.625 --> 00:21:32.185
I didn't tell anyone.

00:21:32.865 --> 00:21:33.865
Why would I do that?

00:21:35.105 --> 00:21:36.105
Who were you talking to?

00:21:36.825 --> 00:21:38.425
I called my attorney.

00:21:38.665 --> 00:21:40.105
I wanted a new one.

00:21:49.345 --> 00:21:50.345
You don't trust me?

00:21:52.025 --> 00:21:52.975
I just thought

00:21:52.997 --> 00:21:55.065
it was only my sister
and I who knew it.

00:21:56.985 --> 00:21:57.825
After I told you about it,

00:21:57.865 --> 00:21:58.865
- then...
- Enough.

00:22:02.665 --> 00:22:04.505
I don't want to be hurt anymore.

00:22:16.945 --> 00:22:19.465
You shouldn't have f*cking told me.

00:22:36.025 --> 00:22:37.945
Where have Mathusorn
and Karakade gone?

00:22:38.825 --> 00:22:40.065
I haven't seen them at all lately.

00:22:41.785 --> 00:22:44.185
Kae is probably with them,
asking the inmates to repay the money.

00:22:47.105 --> 00:22:48.535
By the way, Mangpor,

00:22:48.985 --> 00:22:52.145
when will the new stock arrive?

00:22:53.385 --> 00:22:54.145
There.

00:22:54.185 --> 00:22:54.815
Huh?

00:22:55.305 --> 00:22:56.305
You already dropped it off?

00:22:57.385 --> 00:22:58.825
I thought it'd be
at the end of the month.

00:22:58.865 --> 00:23:00.105
I'm not talking about the stock.

00:23:00.505 --> 00:23:01.905
It's the Rabid Dog.

00:23:02.705 --> 00:23:04.585
She must've found out
the news about her sister.

00:23:04.945 --> 00:23:06.865
It's Kae who spread the news.
I wasn't part of it.

00:23:06.905 --> 00:23:08.905
- Don't do it!
- Please, don't!

00:23:08.945 --> 00:23:09.985
- Hey!
- Come with me.

00:23:10.025 --> 00:23:10.785
Wait...

00:23:10.825 --> 00:23:12.665
What did you hear?

00:23:12.705 --> 00:23:14.185
- I've done nothing!
- Silence!

00:23:16.265 --> 00:23:17.665
Shut your mouth.

00:23:18.265 --> 00:23:20.505
Just nod and play along.

00:23:29.065 --> 00:23:30.425
Did she take the wrong person?

00:23:34.345 --> 00:23:35.265
Shut the door.

00:23:35.505 --> 00:23:37.025
- Hey, you're not allowed in this area!
- How did you get here?

00:23:37.065 --> 00:23:38.425
- You can't be here!
- Leave now!

00:23:38.665 --> 00:23:40.225
- Out!
- I told you to leave!

00:23:40.545 --> 00:23:41.425
Hey, what the hell?!

00:23:45.625 --> 00:23:47.265
Hey! I told you that
you're not allowed!

00:23:47.305 --> 00:23:48.065
After them!

00:23:48.105 --> 00:23:49.745
Don't let them go!

00:23:49.785 --> 00:23:50.825
I actually don't want to be here.

00:23:50.865 --> 00:23:52.145
Incoming!

00:23:52.185 --> 00:23:54.705
The horse is climbing your leg!

00:23:57.785 --> 00:23:58.785
What the hell is going on?!

00:23:59.005 --> 00:24:01.105
I've talked to inmate Mangpor.

00:24:02.745 --> 00:24:05.105
This month, I'm selling the products
from the prison myself.

00:24:06.705 --> 00:24:07.705
Right?

00:24:09.905 --> 00:24:10.905
Are you crazy?

00:24:11.405 --> 00:24:12.785
How can you be sure you can do it?

00:24:12.825 --> 00:24:13.825
It's none of your business.

00:24:14.585 --> 00:24:16.185
Or do you want me to expose you, too?

00:24:19.905 --> 00:24:20.895
What the hell do you want?

00:24:20.935 --> 00:24:23.105
Let me sell
the products instead of her.

00:24:23.505 --> 00:24:24.945
I want permission to leave.

00:24:24.985 --> 00:24:26.505
I only ask for this one time,

00:24:26.625 --> 00:24:27.825
then I'll behave

00:24:29.545 --> 00:24:30.825
and won't cause any more trouble.

00:24:47.745 --> 00:24:48.945
Cause no more trouble?

00:24:49.225 --> 00:24:50.345
You already have.

00:24:50.945 --> 00:24:52.865
The reports
about Pa'Porn's Alzheimer's...

00:24:53.225 --> 00:24:55.105
Do you know how much trouble
I'm in because of it?

00:24:55.505 --> 00:24:57.385
And you still dare ask me
to go outside?

00:24:57.705 --> 00:24:59.705
All I ask for is this one time.

00:25:00.865 --> 00:25:02.145
If I let you leave,

00:25:02.545 --> 00:25:03.545
then you'll try running away.

00:25:04.385 --> 00:25:06.385
Don't you dare beg me for anything

00:25:06.425 --> 00:25:07.705
because I'll never allow it.

00:25:08.025 --> 00:25:09.545
I'll also give you
an increased sentence

00:25:09.585 --> 00:25:10.945
so that you'll stay here until you die.

00:25:10.985 --> 00:25:12.505
Do you think
you can just barge in here

00:25:12.545 --> 00:25:14.345
and hope you get what you want?

00:25:14.705 --> 00:25:15.425
You're f*cking insane.

00:25:15.465 --> 00:25:16.265
It's impossible.

00:25:18.225 --> 00:25:19.365
Let go!

00:25:19.705 --> 00:25:20.985
Sh*t...

00:25:21.865 --> 00:25:22.865
Let me go!

00:25:24.215 --> 00:25:24.915
D*mn it.

00:25:24.945 --> 00:25:26.305
Put her in the hole for a month,

00:25:26.585 --> 00:25:27.745
so she doesn't fly off the handle.

00:25:27.785 --> 00:25:29.655
Wouldn't that be too long?

00:25:29.695 --> 00:25:31.105
Obey my f*cking order!

00:25:31.505 --> 00:25:32.985
Let go of me!

00:25:33.025 --> 00:25:34.745
- I told you to f*cking let go!
- Move!

00:25:34.785 --> 00:25:35.785
You b*stard!

00:25:36.565 --> 00:25:37.905
Let me f*cking go!

00:25:38.145 --> 00:25:39.105
- Move!
- Let go!

00:25:39.145 --> 00:25:40.025
Hands off.

00:25:40.545 --> 00:25:42.145
Let me f*cking go, you b*stard!

00:25:42.185 --> 00:25:43.545
Let me go out!

00:25:43.585 --> 00:25:45.065
- Let go!
- Enough!

00:25:45.905 --> 00:25:46.745
Let me go!

00:25:46.785 --> 00:25:47.905
F*cking let go!

00:25:47.945 --> 00:25:48.825
Let go!

00:25:48.865 --> 00:25:49.945
- Let go!
- She's so strong!

00:25:49.985 --> 00:25:51.705
- Hey, get in!
- Let me go!

00:25:52.025 --> 00:25:53.145
She's so d*mn strong!

00:25:53.185 --> 00:25:54.345
Hey, quickly!

00:25:57.705 --> 00:25:58.585
Gosh...

00:25:58.625 --> 00:26:00.305
She's impossibly strong.

00:26:00.745 --> 00:26:02.185
- Let me go!
- Whoa!

00:26:03.305 --> 00:26:04.305
Kae.

00:26:04.625 --> 00:26:05.505
Hm?

00:26:09.125 --> 00:26:11.105
Claire knew about her sister.

00:26:11.905 --> 00:26:13.825
That's why she went mad
and punched Wichai in the face.

00:26:14.385 --> 00:26:15.945
She's being locked up
alone for a month.

00:26:19.265 --> 00:26:20.265
For a month?

00:26:22.785 --> 00:26:23.625
Good.

00:26:24.145 --> 00:26:26.425
This means she's no longer in my way.

00:26:29.025 --> 00:26:30.505
She won't know that

00:26:31.865 --> 00:26:33.305
we're behind this, right?

00:26:35.985 --> 00:26:37.425
Don't be afraid of her.

00:26:38.165 --> 00:26:39.385
Claire

00:26:40.005 --> 00:26:41.825
isn't as scary as we thought.

00:26:46.505 --> 00:26:47.505
Done?

00:26:48.265 --> 00:26:49.265
That's all you have for me?

00:26:51.545 --> 00:26:53.225
Let me go!

00:26:54.065 --> 00:26:55.185
Let me out!

00:26:55.225 --> 00:26:57.145
I told you to f*cking let me out!

00:26:57.585 --> 00:26:58.585
Out!

00:27:01.025 --> 00:27:02.785
Let me go!

00:27:06.545 --> 00:27:07.945
F*cking let me go!

00:27:08.065 --> 00:27:09.065
Let go!

00:27:09.585 --> 00:27:12.065
Let me f*cking go!

00:27:21.225 --> 00:27:23.225
Sis, I'm hungry.

00:27:23.585 --> 00:27:24.505
Sis, I'm hungry...

00:27:27.905 --> 00:27:28.665
Sis...

00:27:28.705 --> 00:27:29.905
I'm hungry, sis.

00:27:31.545 --> 00:27:32.745
D*mn it, Karakade!

00:27:33.625 --> 00:27:34.745
Eat properly, please.

00:27:35.745 --> 00:27:36.945
F*cking disgusting.

00:27:38.185 --> 00:27:39.585
Do you want some?

00:27:41.985 --> 00:27:42.785
Oh?

00:27:45.145 --> 00:27:46.345
I want a loan.

00:27:47.905 --> 00:27:49.665
Are you for real?

00:27:52.225 --> 00:27:53.145
Hey, Kae...

00:27:53.465 --> 00:27:54.465
What should we do?

00:27:55.065 --> 00:27:57.625
Your roommate
wants to take a loan from us.

00:28:04.945 --> 00:28:05.825
Go ahead.

00:28:07.385 --> 00:28:09.065
The interest rate is 20%.

00:28:09.345 --> 00:28:10.665
Repay us on payday.

00:28:11.465 --> 00:28:12.665
Pay it in one go.

00:28:13.985 --> 00:28:14.985
How much do you want?

00:28:16.885 --> 00:28:17.885
Three thousand baht.

00:28:17.985 --> 00:28:19.385
Why do you need that much money?

00:28:19.905 --> 00:28:20.545
None of your business.

00:28:20.585 --> 00:28:22.825
- Hey, you want trouble, don't you?
- Duen.

00:28:23.385 --> 00:28:25.145
Don't hurt our client.

00:28:26.405 --> 00:28:28.225
When she can't afford to repay...

00:28:28.865 --> 00:28:30.265
we can deal with her later.

00:28:36.505 --> 00:28:37.505
Sis!

00:28:37.545 --> 00:28:40.465
Can I have a loan, please?

00:28:40.945 --> 00:28:42.585
You're talking too much.

00:28:43.265 --> 00:28:44.665
Hey, sis!

00:28:45.065 --> 00:28:45.985
I'm stuck.

00:28:46.025 --> 00:28:47.145
I can't get my head out.

00:28:47.185 --> 00:28:48.025
It hurts!

00:28:48.065 --> 00:28:49.865
Guards! My head is bleeding!

00:28:50.105 --> 00:28:52.025
- Help me.
- I'm helping.

00:28:52.065 --> 00:28:53.185
Don't help her.

00:28:53.385 --> 00:28:55.025
Sis, I'm stuck!

00:29:12.985 --> 00:29:13.985
I'll leave this to you, okay?

00:29:20.985 --> 00:29:21.985
That's a lot.

00:29:22.185 --> 00:29:23.545
Can you afford to repay them?

00:29:25.565 --> 00:29:26.545
Fast!

00:29:28.665 --> 00:29:29.945
Faster!

00:29:32.825 --> 00:29:34.865
Hey, is this as fast as you can go?

00:29:35.945 --> 00:29:36.945
Faster!

00:29:38.985 --> 00:29:40.345
Come on! Faster!

00:29:41.905 --> 00:29:42.825
Yeah.

00:29:46.745 --> 00:29:47.585
Bell.

00:29:50.665 --> 00:29:54.385
You can have the bags
of soil and fertilizer,

00:29:54.545 --> 00:29:57.345
rose seeds,
and gardening tools right away.

00:29:57.645 --> 00:29:59.305
The rest of your stuff
is in the library.

00:30:01.665 --> 00:30:02.705
Thank you, Mangpor.

00:30:02.745 --> 00:30:03.985
Mm, don't mention it.

00:32:59.688 --> 00:33:03.038
[Bell]

00:33:03.062 --> 00:33:05.152
[Claire]

00:34:04.345 --> 00:34:05.425
Kung!

00:34:05.465 --> 00:34:06.345
Kung!

00:34:06.385 --> 00:34:07.105
Kung!

00:34:07.145 --> 00:34:08.465
I'm out of liquor, Kung!

00:34:11.225 --> 00:34:12.345
Kung! Kung!

00:34:12.385 --> 00:34:13.905
Kung!

00:34:14.855 --> 00:34:16.785
I miss you so much!

00:34:16.825 --> 00:34:18.225
Where have you been?!

00:34:22.705 --> 00:34:23.465
I'm out of liquor.

00:34:23.505 --> 00:34:24.825
Please fetch some from my dad's.

00:34:24.865 --> 00:34:25.665
It's in his room.

00:34:25.705 --> 00:34:28.305
- I'm not allowed in Mr. Sutthi's room.
- Well, he's away!

00:34:28.345 --> 00:34:30.065
- Please, fetch it for me.
- Yes, Master!

00:34:32.385 --> 00:34:33.705
Chop-chop!

00:34:34.065 --> 00:34:35.905
You've got this!

00:34:35.945 --> 00:34:37.905
Like the wind, Kung!

00:34:39.505 --> 00:34:41.385
Left, right, left, right, left, right!

00:34:41.425 --> 00:34:43.865
Score!

00:34:45.545 --> 00:34:46.465
- Yeah!
- Top.

00:34:52.705 --> 00:34:54.545
- Uh...
- Jade, your name means a gemstone.

00:34:54.705 --> 00:34:55.865
Jade, your name means a gemstone!

00:34:57.625 --> 00:34:58.785
You're here to see Mr. Sutthi?

00:34:59.145 --> 00:35:00.425
He's not home. He's overseas.

00:35:00.465 --> 00:35:02.345
He's probably going to be away
for a long time.

00:35:02.385 --> 00:35:03.705
I'm actually coming to see you, Top.

00:35:03.745 --> 00:35:06.425
No, no, no! You're lying.

00:35:06.465 --> 00:35:08.305
A person like you only serves my dad!

00:35:08.345 --> 00:35:09.465
You didn't come here to see me!

00:35:09.505 --> 00:35:10.985
But now that you're here, let's drink!

00:35:11.425 --> 00:35:12.345
- Uh...
- Drink!

00:35:13.505 --> 00:35:14.425
Top...

00:35:15.425 --> 00:35:16.425
There's nobody in the kitchen.

00:35:16.465 --> 00:35:18.825
I'm alone and have nobody else.

00:35:18.865 --> 00:35:21.705
You also put my girlfriend in prison.

00:35:21.745 --> 00:35:23.345
That's what I'm actually here for.

00:35:23.545 --> 00:35:24.345
Right.

00:35:25.265 --> 00:35:26.025
Right!

00:35:30.185 --> 00:35:32.265
Ah...

00:35:32.425 --> 00:35:34.145
You're spying on me or something?

00:35:35.505 --> 00:35:37.465
The picture is so old, bro!

00:35:39.425 --> 00:35:41.205
Found it!

00:35:46.065 --> 00:35:47.305
Alright, let's go.

00:35:53.625 --> 00:35:54.945
Right now...

00:35:54.985 --> 00:35:55.665
- Right.
- They...

00:35:55.705 --> 00:35:57.025
They're connecting the dots.

00:35:59.065 --> 00:36:01.185
They found that people who got charged
for drug abuse at the bar

00:36:01.195 --> 00:36:02.425
were your friends.

00:36:02.705 --> 00:36:04.345
To put it simply,

00:36:04.385 --> 00:36:06.905
the evidence is clear that
you were there at the bar.

00:36:07.945 --> 00:36:09.425
Aside from that, though...

00:36:12.625 --> 00:36:14.185
People online
somehow discovered that...

00:36:15.385 --> 00:36:18.785
your confiscated car key
mysteriously went missing.

00:36:18.825 --> 00:36:21.825
Just get to the point already, brother.

00:36:23.225 --> 00:36:26.145
Soon, they'll be able
to trace everything back to you.

00:36:26.505 --> 00:36:28.385
- Right.
- However...

00:36:29.065 --> 00:36:30.345
You still have a way out.

00:36:31.105 --> 00:36:33.345
This will also get Bell out of prison.

00:36:35.505 --> 00:36:38.225
But you might have to cut ties

00:36:38.865 --> 00:36:40.145
with your friends.

00:36:51.185 --> 00:36:52.145
Uh...

00:36:52.185 --> 00:36:54.265
Thank you. I'm actually hungry.

00:36:59.805 --> 00:37:01.385
I want to give this to her and leave.

00:37:01.425 --> 00:37:03.145
This is a restricted area.

00:37:03.345 --> 00:37:04.545
You're not allowed to enter.

00:37:07.545 --> 00:37:08.905
She has to stay there for a long time.

00:37:08.945 --> 00:37:10.465
I think she's probably losing her mind.

00:37:11.985 --> 00:37:13.265
At least...

00:37:13.885 --> 00:37:15.425
Can you give this to her?

00:37:16.345 --> 00:37:17.665
This will make her know that

00:37:18.025 --> 00:37:20.345
someone's waiting for her,
even though she's in there alone.

00:37:20.385 --> 00:37:21.665
I cannot allow that either.

00:37:48.665 --> 00:37:49.945
Your lunch.

00:37:50.185 --> 00:37:51.505
I think you're going to enjoy this.

00:39:42.705 --> 00:39:45.385
I'll never tell your secret to anyone.

00:39:50.510 --> 00:39:52.610
Because I really care about you.

00:40:00.785 --> 00:40:02.465
Please stop being mad at me

00:40:02.505 --> 00:40:04.065
and come out soon, okay?

00:40:08.905 --> 00:40:10.065
I'm waiting for you.

00:41:00.425 --> 00:41:02.345
Bell, I can't do this anymore.

00:41:06.225 --> 00:41:07.345
Are you alright?

00:41:07.585 --> 00:41:08.425
Wait...

00:41:09.905 --> 00:41:11.185
I'll help.

00:41:15.545 --> 00:41:17.185
Thank you. It must've been heavy.

00:41:18.025 --> 00:41:19.585
Don't forget to repay me, alright?

00:41:22.025 --> 00:41:22.745
Mm...

00:41:33.185 --> 00:41:34.985
It's time to pay up, Bell.

00:41:40.262 --> 00:41:42.262
[Claire]

00:41:46.825 --> 00:41:48.905
I haven't done any work at all,

00:41:49.385 --> 00:41:50.625
so I don't have any income.

00:41:51.425 --> 00:41:52.705
Everybody says that.

00:41:53.345 --> 00:41:54.945
Can I at least pay the interest first?

00:41:55.785 --> 00:41:57.505
The principal is 3,000 baht,

00:41:57.545 --> 00:41:59.025
so 20% of that is 600 baht.

00:41:59.065 --> 00:42:00.345
I demand you pay the whole amount.

00:42:01.665 --> 00:42:02.905
I don't accept small payments.

00:42:04.465 --> 00:42:06.225
The total amount
isn't 3,000 baht either.

00:42:07.385 --> 00:42:08.385
It's 9,000 baht.

00:42:08.705 --> 00:42:11.305
It includes the bribe money that let
you attend your dad's funeral...

00:42:13.345 --> 00:42:14.825
and your new shoes.

00:42:17.305 --> 00:42:19.025
If so, I can't repay you.

00:42:19.505 --> 00:42:21.345
- You have...
- Don't give her time.

00:42:22.585 --> 00:42:23.665
You dare interrupt me?

00:42:23.705 --> 00:42:24.705
Yeah, so what?

00:42:25.105 --> 00:42:26.305
She said she had no money.

00:42:26.505 --> 00:42:28.105
Just collect the "interest" from her

00:42:28.145 --> 00:42:29.505
the same way you do with the others.

00:42:30.185 --> 00:42:31.385
It's not that difficult.

00:42:33.905 --> 00:42:35.705
You told us
not to lay our fingers on her.

00:42:37.545 --> 00:42:39.305
I've already withdrawn that condition.

00:42:40.425 --> 00:42:42.305
Claire is going to kill you all.

00:42:45.505 --> 00:42:47.225
Let me tell you girls something.

00:42:48.705 --> 00:42:50.545
Don't be afraid of Claire.

00:42:52.465 --> 00:42:54.065
She's just an insane person.

00:42:54.745 --> 00:42:56.465
She's never actually killed a person.

00:42:57.985 --> 00:42:59.745
She's only serving
the sentence for her sister.

00:43:01.225 --> 00:43:02.305
What the hell are you saying?

00:43:06.865 --> 00:43:07.985
Surprised?

00:43:09.865 --> 00:43:12.865
I'm actually the one
spreading the news about her sister.

00:43:15.105 --> 00:43:17.305
I eavesdropped on everything
you two talked about

00:43:19.345 --> 00:43:21.745
and saw everything you did there.

00:43:25.345 --> 00:43:26.705
Why are you doing this?

00:43:28.385 --> 00:43:30.625
Because you two hurt my feelings.

00:43:32.385 --> 00:43:33.905
That's why I want my revenge.

00:43:34.705 --> 00:43:35.705
Can't I do that?

00:43:46.025 --> 00:43:47.345
What are you waiting for?

00:43:47.385 --> 00:43:48.465
Make her pay.

00:43:49.505 --> 00:43:51.305
Don't be afraid of Claire.

00:43:56.545 --> 00:43:57.545
Mathusorn.

00:43:57.825 --> 00:43:58.745
Karakade.

00:43:59.905 --> 00:44:01.065
Lock her arms.

00:44:02.345 --> 00:44:03.945
- Hey! Hey!
- Let me go.

00:44:05.305 --> 00:44:06.225
Come here!

00:44:06.745 --> 00:44:07.545
Stay still!

00:44:09.185 --> 00:44:10.145
Don't move.

00:44:22.385 --> 00:44:23.585
Teach her a lesson,

00:44:24.305 --> 00:44:25.465
so she learns.

00:44:56.385 --> 00:44:58.385
Why can't I interrupt you, huh?

00:45:04.465 --> 00:45:05.585
What should we do?

00:45:14.385 --> 00:45:16.065
That's enough. She's gonna die.

00:45:16.105 --> 00:45:17.105
Let's go, girls.

00:45:45.265 --> 00:45:46.265
Come on, let's move.

00:45:47.185 --> 00:45:48.185
After her.

00:45:49.105 --> 00:45:50.265
- Come on!
- May I ask for an interview?

00:45:50.305 --> 00:45:51.145
D*mn it.

00:45:51.465 --> 00:45:52.705
Can I please have an interview?

00:45:52.985 --> 00:45:54.625
- May I ask for an interview?
- Natty.

00:45:54.665 --> 00:45:56.345
There is news reporting that

00:45:56.385 --> 00:45:57.945
- you're part of a murder case.
- Calm down, everyone.

00:45:58.345 --> 00:45:59.745
- What are your thoughts on this?
- Calm down, everybody.

00:45:59.785 --> 00:46:00.785
Please calm down.

00:46:00.825 --> 00:46:02.185
- Please step back.
- Do you have anything to say?

00:46:02.225 --> 00:46:04.185
Can we please have an interview?

00:46:08.055 --> 00:46:08.935
Hey!

00:46:09.345 --> 00:46:10.225
You!

00:46:10.505 --> 00:46:11.425
This way!

00:46:11.925 --> 00:46:12.825
Hurry!

00:46:12.865 --> 00:46:13.745
Get in!

00:46:13.785 --> 00:46:14.785
Stop!

00:46:14.825 --> 00:46:15.745
Quickly!

00:46:15.785 --> 00:46:17.065
Come on, get in!

00:46:18.305 --> 00:46:20.065
- Can I have an interview?
- After her!

00:46:20.105 --> 00:46:21.105
Please wait!

00:46:21.145 --> 00:46:22.465
May we ask for an interview?

00:46:22.505 --> 00:46:23.545
Please wait!

00:46:23.705 --> 00:46:25.545
Natty, please wait!

00:46:25.585 --> 00:46:26.905
- Natty!
- Natty!

00:46:26.945 --> 00:46:28.145
- Can we please have an interview?
- Natty...

00:46:28.385 --> 00:46:29.465
Natty.

00:46:32.345 --> 00:46:33.785
Feel free to drop me off here.

00:46:37.785 --> 00:46:39.305
Thank you so much.

00:46:40.065 --> 00:46:41.145
Wait.

00:46:42.345 --> 00:46:43.225
Yes?

00:46:46.505 --> 00:46:48.105
Remember, we've met before?

00:46:50.465 --> 00:46:52.105
We were there
to visit the same inmate

00:46:53.465 --> 00:46:54.465
whose name is Claire.

00:46:55.145 --> 00:46:56.545
Wait, don't leave!

00:46:56.585 --> 00:46:58.065
- Talk to me.
- Let me go!

00:46:58.105 --> 00:46:59.465
I'm done talking!

00:46:59.505 --> 00:47:00.225
Hey!

00:47:25.545 --> 00:47:26.545
You're free.

00:47:50.665 --> 00:47:52.745
The roses are blooming just in time
to welcome you back.

00:48:08.945 --> 00:48:11.345
I've been changing the fertilizer,

00:48:11.385 --> 00:48:13.145
using compost
and manure back and forth.

00:48:13.305 --> 00:48:15.305
I've also been watering them daily.

00:48:17.865 --> 00:48:18.985
Who did this to you?

00:48:20.425 --> 00:48:21.665
Was it Deedee's girls?

00:48:27.545 --> 00:48:28.545
Or was it Kae?

00:48:34.745 --> 00:48:35.545
Claire!

00:48:35.585 --> 00:48:36.885
Don't do it!

00:48:37.225 --> 00:48:38.225
Please don't.

00:48:39.485 --> 00:48:41.505
I don't want to lose you again.

00:48:43.145 --> 00:48:44.265
Please, I beg you.

00:53:12.265 --> 00:53:13.625
- Wait...
- Duen.

00:53:13.665 --> 00:53:14.745
Over there.

00:53:22.265 --> 00:53:23.465
Don't be scared of her.

00:53:24.025 --> 00:53:25.585
She's never actually killed anyone.

00:53:38.745 --> 00:53:41.545
I know you're behind
all this sh*tty stuff,

00:53:43.625 --> 00:53:45.425
including the news about my sister

00:53:46.465 --> 00:53:48.025
and how Bell got hurt.

00:53:56.465 --> 00:53:57.785
Do you know

00:53:58.505 --> 00:54:00.185
what Bell told me?

00:54:03.105 --> 00:54:05.105
She told me not to do anything to you,

00:54:05.665 --> 00:54:07.665
even after all that you did to her.

00:54:15.225 --> 00:54:16.225
From now on,

00:54:17.045 --> 00:54:18.985
don't mess with Bell
and me ever again.

00:54:20.865 --> 00:54:23.465
Or else, the first person I kill

00:54:25.265 --> 00:54:26.265
will be you.

00:54:29.345 --> 00:54:30.345
Got it?

00:54:46.825 --> 00:54:48.745
And about the money Bell owed you,

00:54:52.545 --> 00:54:54.385
I'll find the money
and repay you myself.

00:55:04.105 --> 00:55:05.505
See? I warned you.

00:55:07.145 --> 00:55:09.945
It doesn't matter if she has

00:55:09.985 --> 00:55:10.985
or hasn't killed anyone,

00:55:11.425 --> 00:55:13.345
she's still the Rabid Dog.

00:55:13.665 --> 00:55:14.985
You're so f*cking dumb.

00:55:17.065 --> 00:55:17.865
F*ck off!

00:55:17.905 --> 00:55:19.305
How dare you f*cking say that to me?!

00:55:19.945 --> 00:55:21.465
- How could you say that?!
- So what?

00:55:21.505 --> 00:55:22.395
So what?!

00:55:22.625 --> 00:55:23.625
- Let me go!
- Get off me!

00:55:24.145 --> 00:55:25.345
From now on,

00:55:25.785 --> 00:55:28.505
I'm fully taking over the business.

00:55:28.545 --> 00:55:29.625
You dare do that?

00:55:29.665 --> 00:55:30.665
Yeah!

00:55:31.905 --> 00:55:33.345
Turn around and ask your underlings.

00:55:35.705 --> 00:55:37.265
Just f*cking look at them!

00:55:38.505 --> 00:55:39.985
Let me ask you this.

00:55:40.025 --> 00:55:42.345
What the f*ck do you even do in a day?

00:55:44.345 --> 00:55:46.545
The money
funding the business is mine.

00:55:47.745 --> 00:55:49.065
When the payment's due,

00:55:49.105 --> 00:55:51.305
Karakade and Mathusorn
handle collecting.

00:55:52.065 --> 00:55:54.145
Those who do more
deserve to be paid more.

00:55:54.665 --> 00:55:56.945
Those who do less
deserve to be paid f*cking less!

00:55:56.985 --> 00:55:57.825
Kae!

00:56:00.185 --> 00:56:01.465
You piece of sh*t...

00:56:01.945 --> 00:56:02.945
You're such an a**hole.

00:56:05.545 --> 00:56:06.465
What did you say?

00:56:06.505 --> 00:56:07.945
Don't hurt my sister!

00:56:12.105 --> 00:56:14.585
Without Dao and Wichai,

00:56:15.705 --> 00:56:17.345
it kinda feels empty, huh?

00:56:23.025 --> 00:56:24.745
Don't f*cking do it, Kae!

00:56:24.785 --> 00:56:25.745
What?

00:56:25.785 --> 00:56:26.465
Let her go!

00:56:26.505 --> 00:56:28.065
Are you going to cry?

00:56:28.105 --> 00:56:29.305
Don't f*cking touch her!

00:56:31.625 --> 00:56:32.985
I told you to stop!

00:56:34.705 --> 00:56:35.785
Kae!

00:56:40.665 --> 00:56:42.225
Kae! You b*stard!

00:56:44.905 --> 00:56:46.505
- Kae!
- What the f*ck do you want, huh?

00:56:49.825 --> 00:56:50.945
Are you alright?

00:56:54.105 --> 00:56:55.665
How dare you do this to me?

00:56:56.185 --> 00:56:57.065
I'm really sorry.

00:56:57.105 --> 00:56:58.265
Don't say f*cking sorry!

00:56:59.185 --> 00:57:00.345
Go f*cking away!

00:57:02.265 --> 00:57:03.825
Get out!

00:57:03.865 --> 00:57:05.145
Oh, really?

00:57:05.185 --> 00:57:07.105
Mr. Elephant, I'm doing well.

00:57:07.425 --> 00:57:08.545
Have you had anything?

00:57:08.585 --> 00:57:09.865
Are you out of your mind?!

00:57:10.585 --> 00:57:12.705
You put an inmate
in confinement for a month?

00:57:12.745 --> 00:57:13.505
Well...

00:57:13.705 --> 00:57:15.505
That inmate punched me, sir.

00:57:15.545 --> 00:57:16.905
Then extend her sentence

00:57:16.945 --> 00:57:18.185
and file a report.

00:57:18.905 --> 00:57:20.905
You can't simply
take action so arbitrarily.

00:57:21.285 --> 00:57:23.625
Do you understand what humanity is?

00:57:46.105 --> 00:57:48.185
You f*cking reported
your punishment to the Director?

00:57:50.745 --> 00:57:51.625
Yes.

00:57:52.025 --> 00:57:52.905
I did it.

00:57:53.705 --> 00:57:55.345
That's only the first report
about you, though.

00:57:56.545 --> 00:57:58.425
There are still more reports to come

00:58:00.825 --> 00:58:03.745
from accepting bribe money

00:58:03.785 --> 00:58:05.305
and the affair

00:58:05.345 --> 00:58:07.185
- between...
- Enough. Shut up.

00:58:12.785 --> 00:58:14.305
What do you want?

00:58:17.385 --> 00:58:18.945
Transfer Bell to my cell,

00:58:20.065 --> 00:58:21.665
and I'll be out of your hair.

00:58:22.945 --> 00:58:24.265
What else do you want?

00:58:25.865 --> 00:58:26.865
That's all.

00:58:31.265 --> 00:58:32.145
Fine.

00:59:05.945 --> 00:59:10.345
♫There's a problem
that needs to be resolved♫

00:59:10.385 --> 00:59:14.385
♫You came into my life
and made me sway♫

00:59:14.425 --> 00:59:16.545
♫I'm a bit lost
and don't know what to say,♫

00:59:16.585 --> 00:59:20.745
♫But simply looking into your eyes
makes me fall apart (all bark, no bite)♫

♫I'm husky for your love♫

00:59:22.585 --> 00:59:25.105

00:59:25.265 --> 00:59:26.985
♫Say bow, wow, wow, wow, wow♫

00:59:27.025 --> 00:59:29.705

♫Hug me every day and night♫

♫Let me stay by your side♫

01:00:25.505 --> 01:00:27.585
[Dao, Duen, Deedee]

01:00:27.625 --> 01:00:29.625
Have you ever
thought of going outside?

01:00:31.545 --> 01:00:33.865
Outside the cell or the prison?

01:00:34.105 --> 01:00:35.465
Outside the prison, of course.

01:00:36.345 --> 01:00:37.625
Um...

01:00:38.625 --> 01:00:40.025
At first, I did,

01:00:40.985 --> 01:00:42.185
but not anymore.

01:00:44.905 --> 01:00:46.465
Don't you feel any resentment

01:00:46.985 --> 01:00:50.185
for serving time for a crime
you didn't commit?

01:00:54.345 --> 01:00:55.945
It's what I've chosen,

01:00:57.865 --> 01:00:59.905
so I have to accept the consequences.

01:01:00.865 --> 01:01:02.005
What about you?

01:01:04.265 --> 01:01:06.025
Ever since I got to stay here,

01:01:06.065 --> 01:01:07.625
it's been bad for me.

01:01:08.745 --> 01:01:10.745
I haven't been able
to sleep that well at all.

01:01:12.345 --> 01:01:13.945
All I feel is paranoia.

01:01:17.465 --> 01:01:19.745
However, I do hope that
there's a way to turn my case around.

01:01:21.025 --> 01:01:22.625
I want to get out of here so badly.

01:01:26.265 --> 01:01:27.865
What if I never get to be free?

01:01:32.185 --> 01:01:33.665
Why did you say that?

01:01:37.345 --> 01:01:39.305
I've exchanged my life for my sister's.

01:01:43.425 --> 01:01:45.425
If my freedom

01:01:48.425 --> 01:01:50.625
meant she had to be
locked up here instead...

01:01:54.345 --> 01:01:55.665
I just can't accept that.

01:02:17.905 --> 01:02:20.905
♫You turn the darkness around♫

01:02:21.425 --> 01:02:24.675
