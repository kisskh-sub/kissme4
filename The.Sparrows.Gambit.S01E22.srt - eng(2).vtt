00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.940
Marshal, Marshal Chen is still out.

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:15.700
Wenbin.

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:19.340
What's this?

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:21.940
A birthday cake I made for you.

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:23.380
But it's a bit burnt.

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:34.380
Mmm. Tasty!

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.860
Really?

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:37.060
Really!

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:38.900
I'll make you a cake

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.340
every year!

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:41.980
That's my boy!

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:46.620
So good!

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:51.900
Tomorrow is my birthday banquet.

He'll be back.

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.740
I pointed a gun
at Chen Shangfu yesterday.

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:36.780
I froze.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.140
Couldn't even pull the trigger.

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:45.900
Do you remember

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.420
our first time shooting?

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.100
I couldn't hit a single target.

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.300
Wang Penghui once told me,

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:54.980
"Good shooters are heartless."

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.900
Only the cold-blooded shoot straight.

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.340
Maybe he was right.

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.300
But I only shot straight

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:09.500
after meeting you.

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:14.740
I want to protect you.

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:16.500
I want to be strong

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:18.940
to protect those around me.

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:26.820
Let me fire the shot

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:30.140
tomorrow.

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:34.900
Let me be your gun.

a humble gift for you!

Thank you! Thank you!

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.700
Marshal, you opium trafficker!

no proof,

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.220
just slander me?

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.500
Aren't you being too arrogant?

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:19.060
Marshal!

I heard it.

Where?

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:40.500
Is this proper?

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.180
It's perfectly proper.

Marshal Chen?

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:49.700
Fine.

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:53.980
Miss Liu, you're quite charming,

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:57.340
turning my son against me.

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:59.460
I suppose

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:01.980
I can't stop you today.

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:07.340
Then do it, feel free.

Alright! I know where it is!

Won't you even

call me "Dad" now?

There's nothing here.

who you're seeking,

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:49.700
but I believe

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:52.700
you know this well.

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:54.780
Since Wang Penghui's case,

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:58.020
I've been concerned about opium.

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:00.580
I found this by chance.

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:03.340
It's from ten years ago,

Song City's roots

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:52.220
are rotten with opium.

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:53.820
I came back to investigate.

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:55.500
With or without you,

00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:57.820
things would be the same.

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:01.860
You helped me make up my mind

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:02.940
to do the right thing.

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:05.700
Don't blame yourself.

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:14.740
When this is over,

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:17.900
let's leave here.

No!

Your family. So sweet.

Tell me how you and Jinmo met.

00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:54.740
We met here at this orphanage.

00:08:56.940 --> 00:08:58.300
I trained here.

Jinmo

00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:02.980
was the fairest kid here.

00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:04.900
He got bullied a lot for it.

00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:06.220
Once I saw it,

00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:07.300
I rushed in.

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:10.220
We both got beaten up together.

00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:13.140
Then,

00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:15.300
we paid them all back.

00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:18.340
Candy was the best reward

00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:20.020
that every kid wanted here.

00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:22.900

When I got beaten,

00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:30.220
he'd sneak me a candy.

00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:34.980
