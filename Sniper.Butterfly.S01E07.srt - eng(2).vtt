00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.290
Instead of looking for a job,

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:49.740
in broad daylight,

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.911
you're just hanging around
in my shop, huh?

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:53.490
Don't rush me.

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:55.577
I haven't been this relaxed
in a long time.

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:56.666
I just don't believe

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:57.820
that you can stop

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:59.020
and not look for a job at all.

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.020
Nothing gets past you.

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.850
Yeah.

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.850
Actually, a headhunter

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.044
has already contacted me.

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.170
There is a great creative company.

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:11.060
They offered me a director position,

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:13.260
but I plan to rest for two days

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.333
before I get back to it.

00:02:14.333 --> 00:02:16.610
Such a good opportunity!
Hurry up and go.

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.940
By the way,

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.130
a singer I like
is having a concert here.

00:02:21.244 --> 00:02:22.444
You'll come with me, right?

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:23.570
You go by yourself.

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:25.410
I just want two quiet days.

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:27.660
What's up?

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.610
Just accompanying your brother, huh?

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.540
What?

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:32.730
What's that kid doing?

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:34.130
Going to school?

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.660
Any handsome photos recently?

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:38.570
Like in uniform or something?

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:39.570
Uniform photos?

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.130
That's his school uniform, okay?

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:43.170
Miss.

00:02:43.177 --> 00:02:43.844
Order, please.

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:52.580
(Brother)

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:54.044
(We have exams on Thursday and Friday.)

00:02:54.044 --> 00:02:54.909
(Next week?)

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:55.666
(This week.)

00:02:56.155 --> 00:02:58.220
(His exam results should be
out by now, right?)

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.060
(Why didn't he tell me himself?)

00:03:02.688 --> 00:03:04.290
(Could it be that he didn't do well?)

00:03:07.933 --> 00:03:09.340
I'm going downstairs for a bit.

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.780
Okay.

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:13.420
(Mr. Qi)

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:19.130
(Hello, Mr. Qi.)

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:21.500
(I need to trouble you with something.)

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:23.570
(I want to know)

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:24.940
(Li Wu's exam results this time.)

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:26.540
(He hasn't told me at all.)

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.060
(I'm worried that he didn't do well,)

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:30.266
(so he doesn't want to say.)

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:31.660
(So I didn't ask him directly.)

00:03:31.911 --> 00:03:33.660
(I hope to take a shortcut through you.)

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:35.410
(If possible,)

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:37.010
(I hope you can send me)

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:38.290
(his scores for each subject.)

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:39.260
(That way,)

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:40.060
(I can also)

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:41.290
(know his exact situation.)

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:43.890
(Check for gaps
and apply the right remedy.)

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:45.290
(Thank you.)

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:48.260
Cheng Rui, slow down.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:48.890
Wait for me.

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:49.980
You're too slow.

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:51.730
Li Wu! Feichi!

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:52.540
I gotta go! Bye!

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:53.410
You two, slow down.

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:57.690
Pretty fast, huh?

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:03.570
By the way,

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:04.660
you know what?

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:06.850
Today, at the cafeteria,

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:09.130
I was behind Liu Yating in line.

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.220
She even turned around and spoke to me.

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:12.780
When was that?

00:04:13.155 --> 00:04:15.170
Weren't we just
entering the cafeteria together?

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:16.340
Come on.

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:17.730
She turned her head

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:19.266
to signal him
to keep the noise down.

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:21.100
I thought so.

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.020
Don't care about what she said.

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:24.700
Did she speak to me first?

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:26.170
Yes.

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:28.930
The last time you spoke
to pretty girls

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:30.140
was ages ago.

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:33.170
If you count that,

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:35.340
last week, at the office door,

00:04:35.422 --> 00:04:36.340
I ran into Tao Wanwen.

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:37.850
She even explained two questions to me.

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:39.140
That counts too.

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:40.730
Wen doesn't count.

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:42.730
Why not?

00:04:43.177 --> 00:04:45.410
As a top student, she has a cold face,

00:04:45.444 --> 00:04:46.490
and looks unapproachable.

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:47.900
I agree.

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:50.170
But the way she stays quiet

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:50.810
is pretty, too.

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:51.660
I think so.

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:52.660
I'm warning you.

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:53.900
Don't get any funny ideas.

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:55.490
Wen isn't an ordinary person.

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:57.730
"Wen isn't an ordinary person."

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:00.140
Strange.

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:11.170
Li Wu.

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:12.980
Who do you think

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.488
is the best-looking in our grade?

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:18.810
Enough.

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:20.810
He's upset about the exams.

00:05:53.266 --> 00:05:54.933
I have something to do. I'll go first.

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:57.660
So sudden.

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:00.580
What's going on?

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:20.980
Are you

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:22.140
about to tell me something?

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:26.730
Cen Jin...

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:29.170
Does she know you are like this?

00:06:29.355 --> 00:06:30.866
You're not afraid I'll tell her?

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:35.220
What is it?

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:41.810
If I hadn't asked,

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:42.930
would you

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:44.290
have kept it from me forever?

00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:58.490
I don't know what you're talking about.

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:00.140
Your exam results

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:01.222
have been out for a while.

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:02.370
Why didn't you tell me?

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:09.490
I didn't do well,

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:10.730
so I didn't tell you.

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:13.020
So you planned to keep it a secret?

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:15.460
If you asked me,

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:16.340
I would have told you.

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:18.340
Tell me now.

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:34.460
(Name: Li Wu)

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:35.980
(Class rank: 6, Grade rank: 78)

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:38.460
That's pretty good, isn't it?

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:42.700
Not in the top thirty.

00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:46.340
Does someone demand you get top thirty

00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:47.460
on your first exam?

00:07:49.266 --> 00:07:51.133
What's wrong?
Didn't do well on the exam?

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:53.730
It should be fine.

00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:55.370
How fine?

00:07:56.220 --> 00:07:57.580
Top thirty in the grade?

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:01.290
No.

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:06.660
Can you give me

00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:07.410
this report card?

00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:10.290
I want to paste it in my life journal

00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:11.050
as a record.

00:08:11.244 --> 00:08:13.155
To commemorate your
first successful exam.

00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:19.290
If not,

00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:20.370
I can make a copy.

00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:24.810
Sure.

00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:29.140
Li Wu, you're awesome.

00:08:30.088 --> 00:08:31.220
From now on, remember to

00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:32.355
give me the report cards.

00:08:43.355 --> 00:08:44.340
There's one more thing.

00:08:48.730 --> 00:08:51.490
My mood was unstable recently.

00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:53.940
I don't know

00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:54.890
if it affected you.

00:08:57.155 --> 00:08:58.311
It won't happen again.

00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:03.890
I didn't have siblings growing up.

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:04.940
And I never

00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:06.180
interacted with children.

00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:08.420
So I don't really know

00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:09.370
what kids your age

00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:10.300
are thinking about.

00:09:11.890 --> 00:09:12.890
I hope that from now on,

00:09:12.890 --> 00:09:14.370
whatever you think,

00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:15.700
you can tell me honestly.

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:24.420
Anything?

00:09:26.890 --> 00:09:27.650
Anything.

00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:30.300
Then...

00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:35.460
Then, in the future,

00:09:36.890 --> 00:09:37.890
can you stop

00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:39.460
treating me like a child?

00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:41.420
I'm already an adult.

00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:45.420
Okay.

00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:05.340
What's wrong?

00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:06.180
Go in quickly.

00:10:06.288 --> 00:10:07.688
Don't delay your evening study.

00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:09.300
There's still some time.

00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:11.850
Sister, you go ahead first.

00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:16.111
Wait a moment.

00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:28.770
This is...

00:10:28.770 --> 00:10:30.580
This is lotus seed paste
with salted egg yolk.

00:10:30.622 --> 00:10:33.111
At noon, my parents specifically
asked me to bring it to you.

00:10:33.250 --> 00:10:34.650
And these are your new shoes.

00:10:34.733 --> 00:10:36.039
They arrived and were sent to me.

00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:38.422
Try them when you go back.
They should fit this time.

00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:46.750
Thanks.

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:47.700
Alright, go ahead.

00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:01.490

Ms. Cen's work experience

00:13:19.933 --> 00:13:21.100
and abilities are impressive.

00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:23.820
The projects you led before
for top-tier brands

00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:24.820
were very memorable.

00:13:24.977 --> 00:13:27.150
I've been wanting
to collaborate with you for a while.

00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:28.733
I didn't expect it to happen so soon.

00:13:28.777 --> 00:13:29.666
Finally fulfilled.

00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:32.730
I wonder, Ms. Cen,

00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:34.820
what do you know about AusStar?

00:13:35.422 --> 00:13:36.820
I really loved the advertisement

00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:38.530
that AusStar won an award last year.

00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:39.820
It was creative,

00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:42.333
compelling, and had
a very youthful concept.

00:13:42.890 --> 00:13:43.730
I think

00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:45.130
AusStar's corporate culture

00:13:45.130 --> 00:13:45.850
gives employees

00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:47.250
a lot of freedom to excel.

00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:49.420
For me, it's very attractive.

00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:52.890
When can you start?

00:13:56.250 --> 00:13:57.010
Anytime.

00:13:58.730 --> 00:13:59.850
The holiday is coming up.

00:14:00.890 --> 00:14:01.490
Then...

00:14:02.610 --> 00:14:03.770
After the holiday, okay?

00:14:04.850 --> 00:14:05.250
Of course.

00:14:05.650 --> 00:14:06.100
Great.

00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:09.250
Then let's wish
a pleasant collaboration.

00:14:10.422 --> 00:14:11.733

A reminder to a few students.

00:15:39.890 --> 00:15:40.980
Collect yourselves,

00:15:41.370 --> 00:15:43.200
and don't just think about
going out to play.

00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:45.120
You're almost at the NCEE.

00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:46.590
Repeating a year

00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:48.060
isn't the last chance in life,

00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:50.730
but it's the final push

00:15:51.010 --> 00:15:53.622
in your academic journey,
the stepping stone for your future.

00:15:55.460 --> 00:15:56.250
You've already

00:15:56.250 --> 00:15:57.580
endured a year more than others.

00:15:57.730 --> 00:15:59.130
We can't let it go to waste.

00:15:59.610 --> 00:16:00.420
Got it?

00:16:00.850 --> 00:16:02.530
- Got it.
- Got it.

00:16:21.890 --> 00:16:22.730
Hey, Aunt.

00:17:56.140 --> 00:17:56.980
Why are you here?

00:18:06.644 --> 00:18:07.490
Why didn't you think

00:18:07.490 --> 00:18:09.022
to ask me to give you a ride back?

00:18:10.266 --> 00:18:11.570
I don't want to trouble you.

00:18:12.511 --> 00:18:14.111
Still treating me like an outsider?

00:18:14.155 --> 00:18:15.688
You'd better come up
with another reason,

00:18:15.688 --> 00:18:16.466
or I'll get mad.

00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:18.290
No.

00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:19.940
It's because...

00:18:24.311 --> 00:18:25.530
Because you told me yesterday

00:18:25.530 --> 00:18:26.660
that you're starting work.

00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:28.530
Li Wu,

00:18:28.530 --> 00:18:29.980
can you not be so sensible?

00:19:49.010 --> 00:19:49.940

00:19:50.350 --> 00:19:52.200
You knew I wasn't,
yet you didn't wait for me.

00:19:53.490 --> 00:19:54.050
Sorry.

00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:56.570
No need to apologize.

00:19:57.250 --> 00:19:57.810
Hurry down.

00:19:57.940 --> 00:19:59.010
Your aunt is waiting below.

00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:02.180
Slow down.

00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:07.050
Be careful here.

00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:23.380

00:20:23.770 --> 00:20:24.460
Wu.

00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:29.900
Ms. Cen, slow down.

00:20:37.860 --> 00:20:38.490
Are you okay

00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:39.730
doing this work?

00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:40.730
It's fine.

00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:42.140

00:20:42.730 --> 00:20:43.380

No need to do it.

00:24:21.022 --> 00:24:21.770
No problem, right?

00:24:23.511 --> 00:24:24.810
Thanks for your help, Yiyang.

00:24:25.111 --> 00:24:26.333
You're too polite.

00:24:26.422 --> 00:24:27.810
It's not our first collaboration.

00:24:27.911 --> 00:24:29.133
You provide the funding,

00:24:29.140 --> 00:24:29.940
and our institute

00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:31.140
also has funds for experiments.

00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:32.570
This is a win-win.

00:24:40.010 --> 00:24:40.380
Thanks.

00:24:40.620 --> 00:24:41.090
Thanks.

00:24:42.660 --> 00:24:43.220
Enjoy.

00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:47.810
I've stopped contacting them.

00:24:48.050 --> 00:24:48.980
If you don't believe me,

00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:49.620
I can delete

00:24:49.620 --> 00:24:50.688
everyone in my contacts.

00:24:50.980 --> 00:24:51.570
No need.

00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:53.140
It's fine.

00:24:57.140 --> 00:24:57.660
Chang.

00:24:57.977 --> 00:24:59.050
What are you doing here?

00:24:59.860 --> 00:25:00.770
How did you get here?

00:25:01.155 --> 00:25:03.140
If not for Paopao
accidentally spilling it,

00:25:03.530 --> 00:25:04.490
I wouldn't have known

00:25:04.490 --> 00:25:06.133
you had someone else behind my back!

00:25:06.420 --> 00:25:07.010
Who is he?

00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:08.900
He is...

00:25:09.620 --> 00:25:10.330
Who is he?

00:25:12.530 --> 00:25:13.660
Calling it betrayal

00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:14.620
is the most shameful.

00:25:15.140 --> 00:25:16.050
Aren't you ashamed?

00:25:16.420 --> 00:25:17.860
I've given so much to you,

00:25:18.180 --> 00:25:19.330
planned our future,

00:25:19.644 --> 00:25:21.180
and this is how you repay me?

00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:22.250
I'm sorry.

00:25:22.420 --> 00:25:23.810
It's all my fault.

00:25:24.010 --> 00:25:25.250
I really didn't know

00:25:25.250 --> 00:25:26.290
who to choose.

00:25:26.530 --> 00:25:28.090
Both of you are too good.

00:25:28.530 --> 00:25:30.530
I don't expect your forgiveness.

00:25:31.220 --> 00:25:33.380
People like you don't deserve true love.

00:25:33.940 --> 00:25:34.460
From now on,

00:25:35.010 --> 00:25:36.380
don't contact me again!

00:25:37.380 --> 00:25:37.980
Okay.

00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:39.730
Remember to pay the bill.

00:25:39.860 --> 00:25:40.900
I didn't eat a bite.

00:25:41.730 --> 00:25:42.530
Didn't even drink.

00:25:44.010 --> 00:25:44.730
Chun Chang.

00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:47.490
Li Wu?

00:25:49.810 --> 00:25:51.090
When did you come back?

00:25:51.622 --> 00:25:53.050
You've been gone so many years.

00:25:53.330 --> 00:25:54.980
You didn't even contact me.

00:25:58.700 --> 00:25:59.460
He is...

00:26:00.810 --> 00:26:01.490
Shen Yiyang.

00:26:08.530 --> 00:26:09.620
Really sorry.

00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:12.700
How about taking your pants
to the cleaners?

00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:13.700
I'll pay for it.

00:26:14.290 --> 00:26:14.810
No need.

00:26:15.050 --> 00:26:16.420
Anyway, I just saw a good show.

00:26:16.810 --> 00:26:17.460
It balances out.

00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:50.090
Hey, Ms. Cen Jin.

00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:51.700
Hey, Cheng Rui.

00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:52.490
Can you help me

00:26:52.490 --> 00:26:53.733
get Li Wu to come downstairs?

00:26:55.911 --> 00:26:57.555
You're downstairs at our company?

00:26:59.490 --> 00:27:00.380
Li Wu isn't here.

00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:01.700
He went to talk to my uncle.

00:27:02.250 --> 00:27:03.380
Did you call him?

00:27:03.644 --> 00:27:05.177
I did, but he didn't pick up.

00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:07.980
Then, he probably isn't done yet,

00:27:08.490 --> 00:27:09.380
but should be soon.

00:27:10.620 --> 00:27:11.490
After finishing,

00:27:11.511 --> 00:27:13.577
this workaholic will definitely
return to the office.

00:27:14.222 --> 00:27:15.680
Why don't you come up for some water,

00:27:15.711 --> 00:27:16.570
sit and wait for him?

00:27:17.177 --> 00:27:18.355
We haven't chatted in ages.

00:27:18.355 --> 00:27:20.050
Every time we meet,
it's always for a meeting.

00:27:20.050 --> 00:27:21.050
No time to talk.

00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:23.380
Alright, wait for me then.

00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:29.530
Finally got rid of them.

00:27:29.860 --> 00:27:30.570
If not for my mom

00:27:30.570 --> 00:27:31.980
forcing me to meet each one,

00:27:32.180 --> 00:27:33.250
I wouldn't have bothered.

00:27:33.530 --> 00:27:34.860
Each one weirder than the last.

00:27:35.155 --> 00:27:36.660
There's one we haven't started yet,

00:27:36.660 --> 00:27:37.770
but he has already decided

00:27:37.770 --> 00:27:39.309
how many kids I'll have after marriage.

00:27:39.310 --> 00:27:41.400
And I must go to his home
for the Chinese New Year.

00:27:41.444 --> 00:27:42.711
Another one was even weirder.

00:27:42.730 --> 00:27:43.250
One day,

00:27:43.250 --> 00:27:44.420
I accidentally

00:27:44.420 --> 00:27:45.730
found a spreadsheet on his phone.

00:27:46.010 --> 00:27:47.220
On that spreadsheet,

00:27:47.570 --> 00:27:49.530
there were at least 20 girls.

00:27:49.980 --> 00:27:51.900
They're all the times and places

00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:53.490
he met every girl.

00:27:53.490 --> 00:27:55.290
Isn't he a time management master?

00:27:57.777 --> 00:27:59.460
But if you're breaking up,
just break up.

00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:00.140
Doing this

00:28:00.140 --> 00:28:02.180
only ruins your own image.

00:28:02.222 --> 00:28:04.444
Hurts the enemy a thousand,
harms yourself eight hundred.

00:28:04.466 --> 00:28:05.290
But I had no choice.

00:28:05.290 --> 00:28:05.770
This guy

00:28:05.770 --> 00:28:07.420
has an inexplicable confidence.

00:28:07.622 --> 00:28:08.810
If I don't use these tactics,

00:28:08.810 --> 00:28:09.977
I just can't get rid of him.

00:28:16.860 --> 00:28:18.780
(Cheng Rui)

00:28:19.570 --> 00:28:20.010
Hello.

00:28:26.570 --> 00:28:27.010
Okay.

00:28:29.533 --> 00:28:30.420
I have something to do.

00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:31.090
I'll go first.

00:28:31.290 --> 00:28:32.010
Okay, go ahead.

00:28:32.066 --> 00:28:32.810
Sure, see you later.

00:28:32.810 --> 00:28:33.822
Leaving first, Yiyang.

00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:34.940
Well...

00:28:36.330 --> 00:28:36.900
Li Wu.

00:28:38.644 --> 00:28:39.400
Don't forget.

00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:44.250
Hello.

00:28:44.250 --> 00:28:45.290
You're Shen Yiyang, right?

00:28:47.090 --> 00:28:48.530
I'm also Li Wu's friend.

00:28:48.530 --> 00:28:49.622
My name is Chun Chang.

00:28:50.311 --> 00:28:51.590
Let's add each other on WeChat.

00:28:51.770 --> 00:28:53.290
I have a bar nearby,

00:28:53.620 --> 00:28:54.380
called Chang.

00:28:54.380 --> 00:28:55.140
Come by sometime.

00:28:56.180 --> 00:28:57.311
No need to trouble yourself.

00:28:59.140 --> 00:28:59.770
Look.

00:28:59.770 --> 00:29:01.330
I even dirtied your clothes.

00:29:02.570 --> 00:29:03.380
We should

00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:04.460
exchange contact info.

00:29:04.511 --> 00:29:06.288
I'll transfer you the laundry fee.

00:29:23.810 --> 00:29:24.660
I'm not used

00:29:24.660 --> 00:29:26.140
to scanning strangers' payment codes.

00:29:26.770 --> 00:29:27.530
I'm not used

00:29:27.530 --> 00:29:28.730
to scanning strangers' WeChats.

00:29:29.066 --> 00:29:30.330
Just transfer directly to me.

00:29:32.380 --> 00:29:33.010
Okay.

00:29:38.660 --> 00:29:39.622
You decide the amount.

00:29:40.140 --> 00:29:41.266
Bye.

00:29:49.733 --> 00:29:50.420
Wait a moment.

00:29:50.488 --> 00:29:51.200
It'll be quick.

00:29:51.250 --> 00:29:51.620
Okay.

00:30:05.330 --> 00:30:05.730
Here.

00:30:06.460 --> 00:30:08.250
Li Wu's treasured white tea.
Very fragrant.

00:30:08.660 --> 00:30:09.420
Good for the skin.

00:30:16.222 --> 00:30:17.222
Be careful. It's hot.

00:30:17.222 --> 00:30:18.290
Okay, thanks.

00:30:24.730 --> 00:30:27.570
Li Wu always forgets
to take his medicine.

00:30:27.900 --> 00:30:28.490
I'm almost

00:30:28.490 --> 00:30:29.570
becoming his caregiver.

00:30:31.050 --> 00:30:31.900
This is his medicine?

00:30:34.770 --> 00:30:35.380
Yes.

00:30:36.220 --> 00:30:36.810
Who else

00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:37.700
could it be?

00:30:39.380 --> 00:30:39.940
Here too.

00:30:43.860 --> 00:30:44.700
An old problem.

00:30:45.140 --> 00:30:45.730
Insomnia.

00:30:46.090 --> 00:30:46.730
Migraines.

00:30:46.980 --> 00:30:48.570
Plus, working like crazy.

00:30:49.050 --> 00:30:50.180
I always say

00:30:50.420 --> 00:30:51.420
that his deadly trio

00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:53.460
relies on these bottles to cope.

00:30:54.290 --> 00:30:55.530
Does he often have insomnia?

00:30:58.730 --> 00:30:59.844
Hasn't he seen a doctor?

00:31:00.250 --> 00:31:01.140
He has.

00:31:02.290 --> 00:31:05.090
Treatment is only 30%.
The other 70% is self-care.

00:31:05.420 --> 00:31:06.490
But when he works,

00:31:06.490 --> 00:31:07.222
he goes all out.

00:31:07.444 --> 00:31:08.711
His insomnia can't be cured.

00:31:13.220 --> 00:31:13.980
Ms. Cen Jin.

00:31:14.660 --> 00:31:15.660
You know him very well.

00:31:15.777 --> 00:31:17.311
He is a very driven person.

00:31:17.330 --> 00:31:18.570
He shoulders everything himself.

00:31:19.530 --> 00:31:20.620
When he first went abroad,

00:31:21.090 --> 00:31:22.730
he didn't tell us anything.

00:31:23.220 --> 00:31:24.259
I only found out about it

00:31:24.260 --> 00:31:26.177
after arriving in the US
and asking his classmates.

00:31:26.711 --> 00:31:27.530
When he first arrived,

00:31:27.530 --> 00:31:28.620
he was in a terrible state.

00:31:28.866 --> 00:31:30.600
No one knows where he is all day long.

00:31:30.660 --> 00:31:31.711
He hardly slept either.

00:31:32.688 --> 00:31:34.770
(During the first few months,
they hardly saw him)

00:31:34.770 --> 00:31:35.660
(in the dorm.)

00:31:36.155 --> 00:31:37.330
(He lost a lot of weight.)

00:31:44.010 --> 00:31:44.620
Daniel.

00:31:45.050 --> 00:31:47.290
It's already 3:30 AM.
Why aren't you sleeping?

00:31:48.660 --> 00:31:49.090
Yeah.

00:31:50.290 --> 00:31:51.250
I'm going to sleep now.

00:31:51.420 --> 00:31:52.490
I'll get some water.

00:31:52.730 --> 00:31:53.010
Okay.

00:32:06.810 --> 00:32:09.250
Daniel, you can't keep staying up
like this.

00:32:09.420 --> 00:32:10.090
Go to sleep.

00:32:10.810 --> 00:32:11.330
Yeah.

00:32:11.666 --> 00:32:12.419
Good night.

00:32:12.420 --> 00:32:13.133
Good night, man.

00:32:17.090 --> 00:32:18.180
(When he finally perked up,)

00:32:18.490 --> 00:32:20.050
(I thought everything would get better.)

00:32:20.460 --> 00:32:22.220
(But he started studying like crazy.)

00:32:22.422 --> 00:32:24.010
(Every day it was either school or work,)

00:32:24.010 --> 00:32:25.180
(or he'd be in the library,)

00:32:25.180 --> 00:32:26.177
(or in the computer lab.)

00:32:26.530 --> 00:32:27.860
(Even harder than in senior year.)

00:32:28.770 --> 00:32:30.460
(During the pandemic, he got COVID.)

00:32:30.711 --> 00:32:31.380
(He had a fever,)

00:32:31.380 --> 00:32:32.422
(but didn't stop studying.)

00:32:32.711 --> 00:32:34.577
(I was scared just watching him then.)

00:32:36.570 --> 00:32:38.900
(Later, he published several articles.)

00:32:39.311 --> 00:32:40.420
(Actually, very few people)

00:32:40.420 --> 00:32:41.810
(could publish continuously)

00:32:42.050 --> 00:32:43.330
(in top journals)

00:32:43.330 --> 00:32:44.330
(in such a short time.)

00:32:44.570 --> 00:32:45.700
(But he worked too hard,)

00:32:46.940 --> 00:32:48.530
(either doing experiments,)

00:32:48.530 --> 00:32:49.250
(generating data,)

00:32:49.770 --> 00:32:51.460
(or looking for topics,)

00:32:51.460 --> 00:32:52.511
(writing new articles.)

00:32:56.666 --> 00:32:58.111
(He began applying for internships)

00:32:58.155 --> 00:32:59.020
(before graduating.)

00:32:59.111 --> 00:33:01.810
(But he didn't neglect working
with us on our startup.)

00:33:03.044 --> 00:33:04.288
(When we just started,)

00:33:04.288 --> 00:33:06.050
(he attended classes
and interned during the day.)

00:33:06.050 --> 00:33:07.177
(At night, he'd work with us)

00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:08.600
(handling Tongchen's work online.)

00:33:08.711 --> 00:33:10.940
(He couldn't even sleep
for three hours a day.)

00:33:11.222 --> 00:33:12.577
(I've also asked him what exactly)

00:33:12.577 --> 00:33:14.111
(he was rushing against the clock for.)

00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:14.888
(He didn't say.)

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:17.250
(When I first went abroad,)

00:33:17.770 --> 00:33:18.490
(his headaches)

00:33:18.490 --> 00:33:19.444
(had already started.)

00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:21.810
(Never fully healed?)

00:33:22.133 --> 00:33:23.490
(Don't even mention curing them.)

00:33:24.050 --> 00:33:24.940
(Later, it got so bad,)

00:33:24.940 --> 00:33:26.066
(and he needed medication.)

00:33:26.250 --> 00:33:26.980
(And then later,)

00:33:27.140 --> 00:33:28.530
(ordinary medicine didn't work.)

00:33:29.622 --> 00:33:30.644
(But he's stubborn,)

00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:32.177
(and won't listen to persuasion.)

00:33:32.380 --> 00:33:33.700
(Keeps shouldering it himself.)

00:33:34.777 --> 00:33:36.620
(I'm afraid, one day,
he'll just collapse.)

00:33:38.577 --> 00:33:39.460
(Ms. Cen Jin.)

00:33:41.050 --> 00:33:43.700
(If you have a chance,
please try to persuade him, too.)

00:33:44.490 --> 00:33:46.460
(He'll listen to what you say.)

00:33:49.570 --> 00:33:50.220
Want some?

00:33:54.420 --> 00:33:55.330
What are you thinking?

00:33:56.660 --> 00:33:57.050
Want some?

00:33:57.860 --> 00:33:58.380
No, thanks.

00:34:00.700 --> 00:34:01.250
Jun.

00:34:02.050 --> 00:34:03.730
Do people around you get migraines?

00:34:06.810 --> 00:34:07.860
Many get migraines

00:34:07.860 --> 00:34:08.650
during their period.

00:34:09.288 --> 00:34:10.820
Sinusitis can also cause headaches.

00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:12.977
My dad also has a headache.

00:34:13.044 --> 00:34:14.380
And my daughter sometimes says,

00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:16.000
"Mom, my head hurts so much today."

00:34:16.044 --> 00:34:17.130
We took her to the hospital,

00:34:17.260 --> 00:34:18.170
but nothing was found.

00:34:18.222 --> 00:34:19.210
So we just drop it.

00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:21.690
What's wrong? Your head hurts?

00:34:22.050 --> 00:34:22.940
I have painkillers.

00:34:24.010 --> 00:34:24.530
Not me.

00:34:25.420 --> 00:34:27.010
It's a friend of mine.

00:34:28.380 --> 00:34:29.090
Is it serious?

00:34:29.690 --> 00:34:30.340
I heard

00:34:30.340 --> 00:34:31.780
he's taking level-2 painkillers.

00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:34.300
That's pretty serious.

00:34:35.650 --> 00:34:37.980
Isn't Dr. Lu a neurologist?

00:34:37.980 --> 00:34:39.888
You could introduce
your friend to see him.

00:34:44.260 --> 00:34:45.820
Jun. I'll take a half-day off.

00:34:45.820 --> 00:34:46.933
Going out for something.

00:34:51.460 --> 00:34:52.050
(Where is she?)

00:34:53.488 --> 00:34:55.777
(Ms. Cen Jin said she had something
to do and left.)

00:34:57.980 --> 00:34:58.570
Li Wu.

00:36:06.940 --> 00:36:07.420
Thank you.

00:36:07.940 --> 00:36:08.420
Thank you.

00:36:08.420 --> 00:36:08.940
Enjoy.

00:36:21.010 --> 00:36:21.490
No.

00:36:42.980 --> 00:36:43.690

00:36:45.690 --> 00:36:46.300
Here you go.

00:37:01.980 --> 00:37:02.900

00:37:04.460 --> 00:37:05.380
That night, I...

00:37:05.380 --> 00:37:06.210
That night...

00:37:07.130 --> 00:37:07.740
It's fine.

00:37:08.690 --> 00:37:09.420
Fine?

00:37:13.610 --> 00:37:14.690
I mean...

00:37:15.650 --> 00:37:16.740
I won't take

00:37:16.940 --> 00:37:19.010
what you said
when you were drunk seriously.

00:37:20.300 --> 00:37:23.380
So no need to worry about it either.

00:37:33.010 --> 00:37:33.490
Okay.

00:37:41.155 --> 00:37:43.311
Is there anything else
you came to see me today?

00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:49.844
I want to apologize to you.

00:37:52.460 --> 00:37:53.570
Since you came back,

00:37:54.490 --> 00:37:55.490
we've never

00:37:56.050 --> 00:37:57.940
had a calm and proper conversation.

00:38:02.260 --> 00:38:03.010
I feel...

00:38:04.490 --> 00:38:06.130
I owe you a proper apology.

00:38:08.010 --> 00:38:08.980
Back then,

00:38:09.688 --> 00:38:11.177
I didn't handle things well.

00:38:13.170 --> 00:38:14.777
Maybe there were better ways.

00:38:15.940 --> 00:38:16.610
But I chose...

00:38:16.610 --> 00:38:17.733
Have you ever regretted it?

00:38:28.244 --> 00:38:28.820
No.

00:38:30.530 --> 00:38:31.130
At that time,

00:38:32.170 --> 00:38:33.010
you had to leave.

00:38:42.022 --> 00:38:43.570
So what are you apologizing for?

00:38:47.780 --> 00:38:48.740
Cheng Rui told me

00:38:50.340 --> 00:38:51.420
your health is not good.

00:38:52.555 --> 00:38:54.460
It's an illness you get
after going abroad...

00:38:56.933 --> 00:38:58.210
