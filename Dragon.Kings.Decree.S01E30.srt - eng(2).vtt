and that fake Saintess Liluo

Guards,

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:30.338
get her out of here.

00:04:30.339 --> 00:04:31.939
I am the real Saintess.

Prince Zhi,

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:35.140
how dare you do this to me?

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:36.098
Let go!

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:38.619
You have to return to the sanctuary
and give His Majesty

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:40.260
an explanation on this matter.

00:04:44.299 --> 00:04:46.338
You have an extreme yin constitution

00:04:46.339 --> 00:04:49.098
and improved your War God Constitution
with the dragon pearl.

00:04:49.099 --> 00:04:50.819
All signs confirm

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:52.978
you are the real Wujing Saintess.

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:55.619
Please come back with us
to the sanctuary.

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:00.419
Now you acknowledge me

00:05:01.099 --> 00:05:02.340
because you're in danger.

00:05:03.859 --> 00:05:06.619
You two should leave.

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:08.979
Chu Moshang and I are already married,

00:05:09.339 --> 00:05:12.179
but the sanctuary's collapse
is still ongoing.

00:05:12.339 --> 00:05:13.220
Young Master,

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.020
we should hurry back to the sanctuary.

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:16.580
She was right.

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:18.379
The Dragon King's Decree prophecy

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:20.179
can't save the sanctuary.

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:25.539
I'll wait for you here.

00:05:47.339 --> 00:05:48.340
Shang,

00:05:49.739 --> 00:05:51.340
you were right.

00:05:51.859 --> 00:05:53.979
Marrying the Wujing Saintess

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:57.979
can't save the sanctuary
from this disaster.

00:05:59.179 --> 00:06:01.020
We were all wrong.

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:04.099
We were all wrong.

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:07.659
Is this the end of the sanctuary?

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:10.419
Is this the end of the sanctuary?

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:11.580
Your Majesty,

00:06:11.779 --> 00:06:13.459
Prince Zhi has always known

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:15.139
Liluo isn't the true Wujing Saintess.

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:16.499
How should he be punished?

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:18.220
When a Dragon makes mistakes,

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:20.539
it's never just simple lectures.

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:23.140
With the Black and White Envoys here,

00:06:23.299 --> 00:06:25.780
I believe they'll carry out
the fairest execution.

00:06:25.979 --> 00:06:27.418
Winner takes all.

00:06:27.419 --> 00:06:28.739
I accept the consequences.

00:06:29.299 --> 00:06:30.979
I have nothing more to say.

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.978
Prince Zhi angered the Dragon God.

00:06:33.979 --> 00:06:35.260
His crime is unforgivable.

00:06:35.659 --> 00:06:37.858
He's sentenced to endless torment,

00:06:37.859 --> 00:06:39.459
repeating forever

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:42.460
until he earns
the Dragon God's forgiveness.

00:06:45.419 --> 00:06:46.460
Father,

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:49.859
even till the very last moment,

00:06:49.979 --> 00:06:51.780
you never cared about me.

00:06:52.779 --> 00:06:54.580
I'll make sure you regret

00:06:54.979 --> 00:06:57.619
the decision you made today.

00:07:03.419 --> 00:07:04.299
Mother.

00:07:04.539 --> 00:07:05.580
Zhilou.

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:07.499
Wujing Saintess, congratulations

00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:10.020
for reclaiming everything
that belongs to you.

00:07:14.099 --> 00:07:15.299
But...

00:07:17.179 --> 00:07:18.739
what if it's all been a mistake?

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:21.059
What if I'm not really
the Wujing Saintess?

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:22.139
Zhilou,

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:24.218
even if you're not the Wujing Saintess,

00:07:24.219 --> 00:07:25.218
to us,

00:07:25.219 --> 00:07:26.940
you'll always be one.

00:07:27.099 --> 00:07:30.139
The Wujing Saintess' coronation
never requires proof.

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:31.580
Only the world's acceptance.

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:33.178
To me, our Dragon Queen

00:07:33.179 --> 00:07:35.499
is incomparable in the world.

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:36.780
You're the best.

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:37.900
Zhilou,

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:41.020
you deserve to be the Wujing Saintess.

00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:42.338
Feng Zhilou!

00:07:42.339 --> 00:07:44.059
Why did you wear my battle robe?

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:45.739
You witch.

00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:47.820
I can't kill you
no matter how hard I try.

00:07:47.859 --> 00:07:49.538
I can't escape you
no matter where I hide.

00:07:49.539 --> 00:07:51.940
And now you even dare
to wear my battle robe?

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.178
I'm the real Wujing Saintess!

00:07:54.179 --> 00:07:55.978
I'm the future Dragon Queen!

00:07:55.979 --> 00:07:57.499
It's me!

00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:03.820
Her blood poisoning is flaring up.

00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:10.700
My hair.

00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:13.780
My face!

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:16.139
Why is this happening?

00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:17.499
Why is this happening?

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:18.978
Karma is catching up.

00:08:18.979 --> 00:08:19.899
I don't want this.

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:20.619
I...

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:21.418
I don't want this.

00:08:21.419 --> 00:08:23.658
I don't want to become like my mother.

00:08:23.659 --> 00:08:24.579
No way.

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:25.139
Mother,

00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:26.379
please save me.

00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:28.020
To become the Dragon Queen,

00:08:28.299 --> 00:08:30.700
she didn't even get to see
her mother one last time.

00:08:30.779 --> 00:08:31.580
No!

00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:32.340
No!

00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:39.139
The sanctuary.

00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:41.379
I'm going to the sanctuary.

00:08:41.699 --> 00:08:44.580
I can't just die like this.

00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:01.859
Zhilou,

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:03.099
go on.

00:09:33.059 --> 00:09:33.859
Shang,

00:09:34.779 --> 00:09:35.899
what are you doing?

00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:38.298
He's sacrificing himself.

00:09:38.299 --> 00:09:41.360
He's transferring his life force to the Tree
of Life to protect the sanctuary's barrier.

00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:43.619
Saving the sanctuary
has always been our duty as people

00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:44.700
of the sanctuary.

00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:45.940
His life force isn't enough.

00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:47.180
We'll do our part too.

00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:51.619
This is the real power
of the Dragon King

00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:54.460
and the Wujing Saintess.

00:10:56.419 --> 00:10:58.019
Yes, it worked.

00:10:58.020 --> 00:10:59.259
This is great.

00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:06.940
Honey,

00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:08.420
help me gather these herbs.

00:11:15.699 --> 00:11:17.578
It's basically a miracle.

00:11:17.579 --> 00:11:20.220
His lordship actually regained his sight

00:11:20.579 --> 00:11:23.099
and opened the apothecary to us.

00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:24.580
My stomach feels a bit off.

00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:25.698
That's nothing.

00:11:25.699 --> 00:11:28.660
His lordship's wife
is blessed by the Dragon God.

00:11:28.819 --> 00:11:31.540
Even her muteness is cured.

00:11:31.659 --> 00:11:32.499
Yeah.

00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:33.658
It's a miracle.

00:11:33.659 --> 00:11:35.180

00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:49.420
You forgot already?

00:11:49.459 --> 00:11:50.940
I just told you yesterday.

00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:54.698
This is poria.

00:11:54.699 --> 00:11:55.940

It's an important occasion.

He's just a flood dragon,
