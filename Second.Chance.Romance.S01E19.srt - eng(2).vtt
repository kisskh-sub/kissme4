Hello.

I often hear Le talk about you.

Ms. Tan,

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:26.020
I had so much

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:28.100
I wanted to say to you
when I saw you today.

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:30.170
Too bad Grandma cut in.

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:32.140
What did you want to say?

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:33.930
Nothing really.

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:35.340
I just wanted to chat.

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:37.610
I've been so bored lately.

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:39.250
Oh,

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:40.370
I should tell you...

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:43.700
the wedding between my dad
and Ms. Wen is off.

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:45.540
Le,

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:47.460
aren't you

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:49.850
upset that your dad's wedding

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:51.540
got called off?

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:55.460
Of course I'm a little upset.

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:59.020
But like I said,

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:02.170
who he marries is his own business.

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:04.410
I just think

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:06.780
Ms. Wen has been really good
to both of us.

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.020
I just feel a bit bad for her.

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:11.660
But it's okay.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.220
I'm pretty easygoing about it.

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:14.540
Ms. Wen and I

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:15.850
can still be good friends.

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:16.980
Just like you and me.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.900
But my grandma can't accept it.

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:25.540
She really likes Ms. Wen.

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:27.730
She even gave her the family heirloom.

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:30.100
Now that Grandma knows my dad
isn't marrying Ms. Wen,

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:31.220
she seems really mad.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.660
You're quite the little observer.

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:35.780
How do you know about all this?

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:37.140
Oh,

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:38.730
and Yang Zihuan and I

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:40.220
have started working on a new plane.

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:41.580
A new plane?

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:43.580
This one

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:45.490
is way better than the last one.

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:48.850
We made it

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:50.050
even lighter.

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:51.610
It flies super fast.

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:53.540
Give me a demonstration

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:54.900
when it's ready.

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:56.220
Sure.

00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:59.220
Our skills are improving really fast.

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:01.460
That's impressive.

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:03.610
You can join us next time we work on it.

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:05.460
I might not be able to come soon.

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:08.930
Maybe we can schedule it
for another day?

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:10.140
Even better.

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:10.930
And I want a cola.

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:19.170
Do I have to wait in line to call you?

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:23.660
Are you really jealous of your own son?

00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:27.290
You saw Le?

00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:29.850
I did.

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:31.980
But then your mom took him away.

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:34.930
I think my mom

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:37.290
is keeping a close eye on Le right now.

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:40.250
I really wish

00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:42.140
I could see Le every single day

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:43.170
and make up

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:44.930
for all the love

00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:48.020
I owe him

00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:49.490
over the past 12 years.

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:51.930
I understand how you feel.

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:53.900
Le told me today

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:55.490
that your wedding is off.

00:07:55.950 --> 00:07:57.340
He told you all that?

00:07:58.870 --> 00:08:00.100
Seems you two get along really well.

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:02.220
A strong blood bond

00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:04.930
and an irresistible magnetic attraction
between us.

00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:08.660
But he said your mom

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:09.900
seems really mad.

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:12.020
Though I can imagine why.

00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:15.250
My mom

00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:17.660
might have a hard time accepting it.

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:20.020
Just give her a little more time.

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:23.780
Honestly, I don't care
about your mom's stance.

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:25.610
I'm just worried she might do something.

00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:27.490
I don't want Le to get hurt.

00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:28.930
She won't.

00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:31.050
My mom loves Le very much.

00:08:32.670 --> 00:08:34.250
But if it's about getting at me,

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:37.530
I think she's capable of anything.

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:44.180
Feng Rui,

00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:47.100
let's go to France.

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:49.650
The three of us
could go to Paris together.

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:51.530
I could keep teaching ballet,

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:53.250
and you could sell wine.

00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:54.490
Just the three of us.

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:56.420
No one else to bother us.

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:06.420
It's nothing. I was just saying.

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:07.700
No.

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:08.610
I... I was thinking...

00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:11.180
Don't worry about it. I was just saying.

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:12.100
You don't have to take it seriously.

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:13.890
Really.

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:16.130
I think that sounds great.

00:09:17.270 --> 00:09:18.980
The three of us

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:20.820
will go to Paris together

00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:22.420
and

00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:24.370
never be apart.

00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:27.220
Okay.

00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:30.220
Okay.

00:09:47.270 --> 00:09:47.650
Dad,

00:09:49.270 --> 00:09:50.940
Rui and Yan's engagement

00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:52.060
is off.

00:09:57.630 --> 00:09:58.580
Is it

00:09:58.980 --> 00:09:59.850
because of that girl?

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:02.100
They went to Hongyuan County
in Aba Prefecture, Sichuan.

00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:04.250
It seems he's made up his mind

00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:06.130
to be

00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:07.180
with Tan Siting.

00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:10.980
Some things

00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:13.610
can't be kept hidden forever, Hui.

00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:16.100
I always thought Rui was a smart kid.

00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:17.530
After all these years,

00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:19.300
he should know

00:10:19.510 --> 00:10:20.650
what kind of girl

00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:21.610
is most suitable for him.

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:23.530
But that's not the case.

00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:26.180
He's treating me like an enemy now.

00:10:27.550 --> 00:10:28.770
Rui is naive, after all.

00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:30.460
Talk to him properly.

00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:31.530
Maybe there's a way.

00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:32.100
Dad,

00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:33.580
you know how he's been

00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:34.730
since he was a child.

00:10:35.390 --> 00:10:36.610
Once he sets his mind on something,

00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:37.650
it can't be changed.

00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:39.180
That's also his strong point.

00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:43.060
It seems Rui truly loves her.

00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:49.380
What's the situation with Ms. Wen now?

00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:50.220
She...

00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:52.060
She's not even answering my calls.

00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:54.140
Instead of worrying about Rui,

00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:55.740
you should think

00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:58.900
about how to explain this to Ms. Wen.

00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:11.860
Are you done talking?

00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:16.580
Come take a break.

00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:29.300
Let me ask you,

00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:31.140
over these years,

00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:32.780
have I been

00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:36.300
an adequate mother?

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:41.580
Yes.

00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:47.020
But I feel Rui

00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:49.620
is getting farther and farther
away from me.

00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:52.500
He's grown up.

00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:53.460
Some things

00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:54.860
are beyond our control now.

00:11:57.540 --> 00:11:58.620
He's been like this since he was little.

00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:00.460
In front of me,

00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:02.340
he only ever reported

00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:04.660
his improved grades

00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:06.780
or another award he'd won.

00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:08.580
If his grades slipped,

00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:10.500
or if he was wronged outside,

00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:11.860
he'd always

00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:13.860
come to you.

00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:16.940
Rui

00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:19.780
never shows his vulnerable side

00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:21.300
in front of me.

00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:23.140
That's because he knows

00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:25.340
your expectations are too high.

00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:27.020
He's afraid of disappointing you.

00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:29.180
He's becoming
more and more guarded with me.

00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:31.900
He's learned, almost instinctively,

00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:33.100
what he should say,

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:34.260
what he shouldn't,

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:35.500
what he should listen to,

00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:38.420
and what he shouldn't.

00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:41.900
I feel like I'm losing my place

00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:43.740
in his heart.

00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:46.860
Sometimes

00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:50.140
I'm jealous of you.

00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:53.380
At least he doesn't push you away.

00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:56.100
Look, even the way he looks at me
has changed.

00:12:58.060 --> 00:12:58.900
I'm just tired.

00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:01.260
I don't even want to bother anymore.

00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:12.260
Feng,

00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:15.260
you have to help me this time.

00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:17.860
For our son.

00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:32.700
Oranges!

00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:33.140
Oranges.

00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:33.660
Dad.

00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:33.900
Rui.

00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:35.260
Over here.

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:37.880
[We have our whole lives ahead of us.
No need to rush.]

00:13:37.940 --> 00:13:39.380
How do you even have the time and mood

00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:40.180
to come here for tea?

00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:42.500
We haven't

00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:44.420
sat down and chatted like this
in a long time.

00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:47.020
Let's just relax

00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:48.140
and have some tea today.

00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:49.940
Yours.

00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:52.220
So? Are you busy?

00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:53.180
Not too bad.

00:13:55.580 --> 00:13:56.420
Haven't been here in a while.

00:13:56.700 --> 00:13:57.780
It's still so lively here.

00:13:59.140 --> 00:13:59.540
Rui,

00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:01.140
I heard

00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:03.020
you are

00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:04.620
with Tan Siting now?

00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:07.100
Yes.

00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:09.540
Rui,

00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:12.620
have you thought this through?

00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:17.620
Did... Mom send you?

00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:20.460
Dad, don't worry.

00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:23.500
We've been through so much together.

00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:27.020
We'll make it work.

00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:30.500
And we're different from you and Mom.

00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:32.260
That's good.

00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:33.900
Have some tea.

00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:35.580
Dad,

00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:37.220
I've always wondered

00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:41.340
how you and Mom have managed
these past few years.

00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:45.500
How else?

00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:46.340
We just make do.

00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:47.380
Got used to it.

00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:51.620
A lot of people ask me,

00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:53.140
"Feng Ming,

00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:55.180
how did Gao Hui ever

00:14:55.660 --> 00:14:56.780
fall in love with you back then?"

00:14:58.460 --> 00:14:58.780
She said

00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:00.660
she liked my personality.

00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:01.940
She thought

00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:04.460
people who love reading are gentle.

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:06.140
But look at things now.

00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:07.100
I

00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:09.020
haven't changed, have I?

00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:10.420
But her?

00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:11.900
She just doesn't like it anymore.

00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:14.540
So,

00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:15.860
how long do you think

00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:17.660
feelings can really last?

00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:20.380
It was only after we got married
that we realized

00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:23.140
life wasn't what we imagined.

00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:25.380
Even though I tried my best

00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:26.740
to catch up with her perspective,

00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:29.420
some things

00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:30.900
are just ingrained.

00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:32.260
They can't be changed.

00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:34.660
Like even now, I prefer

00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:36.140
open-air tea houses like this.

00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:38.140
Down-to-earth.

00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:39.140
But your mom

00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:41.460
prefers high-end hotels.

00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:43.660
Marriage

00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:44.900
is like a tree.

00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:46.620
If the roots aren't stable,

00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:48.700
it grows crooked

00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:50.140
and eventually

00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:52.260
falls.

00:15:56.020 --> 00:15:57.860
Have you noticed

00:15:57.980 --> 00:15:59.260
Ms. Wen acting a bit strange lately?

00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:00.780
I noticed a while ago.

00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:03.780
Are she and Mr. Feng
having a disagreement?

00:16:04.660 --> 00:16:06.940
Mr. Feng hasn't come to pick her up
in a long time.

00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:09.060
I feel it's more serious
than just a disagreement.

00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:10.780
Really?

00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:13.300
Do you think their wedding is still on?

00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:14.900
Hard to say.

00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:15.540
Exactly.

00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:18.220
Seeing her like that, it's hard to ask.

00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:21.180
Help me

00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:23.420
pull up the parent information
of the piano class students.

00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:24.060
Okay.

00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:25.300
Look.

00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:25.980
This one.

00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:26.580
This one.

00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:28.340
Which one?

00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:31.020
Huang Hanfei.

00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:31.220
Yes.

00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:31.940
Okay.

00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:33.620
His mom came the other day

00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:34.820
to inquire about his situation.

00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:35.380
Right.

00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:36.340
He hasn't behaved lately.

00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:38.300
Just so you know,

00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:39.380
I'm not getting married.

00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:40.620
The wedding is off.

00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:48.300
Thank you.

00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:48.780
Thank you.

00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:49.180
No problem.

00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:50.940
Let's go.

00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:54.340
How's your dad doing?

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:57.060
Better than I expected.

00:16:58.780 --> 00:16:59.380
That's good then.

00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:01.620
You can finally put down

00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:03.420
that burden you've carried

00:17:03.820 --> 00:17:04.660
for so many years.

00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:05.540
Yeah.

00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:06.340
And you?

00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:09.820
How's that boyfriend
you're so crazy about?

00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:10.740
Me?

00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:11.460
Yeah.

00:17:13.580 --> 00:17:14.180
He's great.

00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:16.820
In what way?

00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:19.620
Can we talk
about that kind of stuff out here?

00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:21.260
We'll save that for when we get home.

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:22.820
Whisper it so no one else hears.

00:17:22.820 --> 00:17:23.380
How about

00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:24.540
I tell you about his business?

00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:28.580
I'm telling you, his business is huge.

00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:29.260
But

00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:30.260
it's mainly

00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:31.660
in real estate.

00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:34.380
Look.

00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:35.020
What?

00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:38.260
A gift!

00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:40.380
A gift?

00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:45.380
"Wang Shuhan, Project Manager".

00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:46.420
Don't praise me yet.

00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:47.660
Let me tell you,

00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:49.540
they started a new project

00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:50.460
in East District.

00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:51.420
But you know what?

00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:52.900
Old-school businessmen

00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:54.780
have pretty old-fashioned thinking.

00:17:54.980 --> 00:17:55.380
So

00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:57.580
I suggested some newer ideas.

00:17:57.580 --> 00:17:58.820
They actually adopted them

00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:00.820
and gave me a Project Manager position.

00:18:01.540 --> 00:18:02.900
- Excellent.
- Excellent.

00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:07.180
Let's raise our coffees.

00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:08.860
To you

00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:10.100
finding your dad,

00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:11.580
and to me

00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:12.820
finding both a job

00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:13.580
and love.

00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:14.340
Cheers.

00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:16.060
You're head over heels.

00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:17.660
France?

00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:19.160
[Cygne]

00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:20.780
Are you going on your honeymoon?

00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:24.340
Look,

00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:26.620
our vineyard

00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:28.060
has restored its production.

00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:30.380
The Cygne brand

00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:31.460
is getting more and more recognition.

00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:32.900
I want to use this momentum

00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:35.340
to promote our brand in France.

00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:37.860
Through tastings

00:18:38.620 --> 00:18:39.380
and wine competitions there,

00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:40.540
we can truly

00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:42.060
expand our brand

00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:43.860
and establish ourselves

00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:44.860
in the international market.

00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:46.380
Sir,

00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:48.020
how long will you be gone?

00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:50.220
What about the business here?

00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:52.220
We still have
so many unfulfilled orders.

00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:54.580
And so many manufacturers...

00:18:54.580 --> 00:18:55.380
I'm leaving it to you.

00:18:56.980 --> 00:18:57.380
We...

00:18:57.380 --> 00:18:58.100
Us?

00:18:58.740 --> 00:18:59.740
You'll be fine.

00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:01.380
Qi, your role stays the same.

00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:02.660
You're responsible

00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:03.580
for orders

00:19:03.580 --> 00:19:04.300
and client relations.

00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:05.620
Your job doesn't change either.

00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:07.940
At most, you'll just go to the winery

00:19:08.340 --> 00:19:09.380
a few more times in my place

00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:10.380
and work closely

00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:11.540
with Duoji,

00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:12.300
keeping in good communication.

00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:13.220
That's all.

00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:14.980
Let's try it for a while.

00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:15.900
If it works out,

00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:17.700
I'll hand the company over
to you completely.

00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:22.260
And if any issues come up,

00:19:22.780 --> 00:19:25.060
I can always communicate
with you from France.

00:19:26.860 --> 00:19:27.460
But

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:29.860
Cygne is your life's work.

00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:31.500
Yes.

00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:34.020
How could the two of us possibly
manage it...?

00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:35.620
You two

00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:36.780
are already really capable.

00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:37.860
Besides,

00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:39.580
aren't you two working together

00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:40.820
better and better?

00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:45.060
Okay.

00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:46.340
We'll do our best.

00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:47.380
Yes, sir.

00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:53.620
There's one more thing
I want to tell you.

00:19:54.780 --> 00:19:56.020
What other big news?

00:19:57.580 --> 00:19:58.780
Feng Rui and I are back together.

00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:02.100
Back together?

00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:04.860
And you've reunited with your child too?

00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:08.020
Not yet.

00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:10.940
Still want to get mentally ready.

00:20:11.780 --> 00:20:13.300
I'm afraid Le

00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:15.620
might not accept it so quickly.

00:20:16.780 --> 00:20:17.660
True.

00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:19.860
Le is still so young.

00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:21.660
You need to give him some time.

00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:22.940
Forget Le,

00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:23.860
if it were me,

00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:25.620
if I suddenly found out I had a mom,

00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:27.100
I couldn't accept it either.

00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:28.380
Yeah.

00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:29.700
We'll take it slow.

00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:31.340
We'll figure things out as we go.

00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:35.620
Siting.

00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:38.860
I won't say much

00:20:39.460 --> 00:20:40.660
about you and Feng Rui.

00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:43.100
As long as you're happy with it,
that's enough.

00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:47.100
But his mom

00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:48.540
is a tough one.

00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:51.780
I knew you'd say that.

00:20:53.540 --> 00:20:54.540
But his mom

00:20:54.540 --> 00:20:56.540
has been standing between us
for so many years.

00:20:58.140 --> 00:20:58.820
It's a really difficult problem.

00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:01.220
I've already figured it out.

00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:03.100
I'm building a life with Feng Rui,

00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:03.980
not his mom.

00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:06.780
Besides, we've already decided.

00:21:07.580 --> 00:21:08.660
We're planning to go to France.

00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:12.940
That way, we can stay away from his mom

00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:14.580
and avoid conflicts.

00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:15.380
That's good.

00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:17.780
You just got back,

00:21:17.780 --> 00:21:18.540
and you're leaving again?

00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:22.180
Just to avoid his mom?

00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:24.580
Not entirely.

00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:27.100
I just don't want
any more entanglements.

00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:31.260
But have you considered

00:21:32.780 --> 00:21:33.620
that Feng Rui and his mom

00:21:33.620 --> 00:21:35.380
are still bound by blood?

00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:37.780
Blood is thicker than water.

00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:38.860
How can you be sure

00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:40.580
they won't have any contact
in the future?

00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:42.220
What if his mother causes more trouble?

00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:43.860
Of course I've thought about it.

00:21:45.620 --> 00:21:46.420
But Feng Rui told me

00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:48.300
he'll handle it.

00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:54.180
That's good then.

00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:14.660
I could

00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:17.140
hear you all chattering from far away.

00:23:17.780 --> 00:23:19.020
Look what I brought you.

00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:20.100
Who's this?

00:23:20.540 --> 00:23:20.780
Coffee.

00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:22.780
Were you taking Yufan

00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:23.900
for interviews again?

00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:25.100
Couldn't really refuse.

00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:26.220
Had no choice but to go.

00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:27.220
Just finished.

00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:28.020
While

00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:30.100
we were being interviewed today,

00:23:30.220 --> 00:23:31.660
I got a call from Sanxiao.

00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:33.460
They invited me

00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:36.020
to share our teaching experience.

00:23:36.940 --> 00:23:37.460
Impressive.

00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:39.140
Sanxiao Ballet Club

00:23:39.140 --> 00:23:41.140
is ranked number one in the city.

00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:42.260
Exactly.

00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:43.100
Its members

00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:45.220
get directly into
the university-affiliated middle school.

00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:46.300
Rankings and actual ability

00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:47.540
are two different things.

00:23:47.780 --> 00:23:49.180
The students from the top-ranked school

00:23:49.220 --> 00:23:50.460
haven't won an international gold medal!

00:23:51.780 --> 00:23:52.940
Yufan really makes us proud.

00:23:53.060 --> 00:23:53.420
Yes.

00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:54.100
Indeed.

00:23:54.940 --> 00:23:55.700
So

00:23:56.220 --> 00:23:57.340
now it's all about the results.

00:23:57.620 --> 00:23:59.420
Only good results bring attention

00:23:59.620 --> 00:24:00.980
and a voice.

00:24:01.540 --> 00:24:02.540
That's true.

00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:03.620
It comes down to ability.

00:24:05.380 --> 00:24:05.940
Ms. Tan.

00:24:06.740 --> 00:24:07.460
Have some coffee.

00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:08.380
Okay.

00:24:10.860 --> 00:24:11.540
You deserve

00:24:11.540 --> 00:24:12.420
part of the credit too.

00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:13.380
I think

00:24:13.540 --> 00:24:14.460
you should get involved too.

00:24:15.060 --> 00:24:16.620
Not me. I'm socially awkward.

00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:17.620
Socially awkward?

00:24:17.980 --> 00:24:18.260
Yeah.

00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:19.540
I'll leave everything else to you.

00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:20.460
Alright then.

00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:21.940
I'll handle

00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:23.020
the social butterfly stuff.

00:24:26.020 --> 00:24:26.300
By the way,

00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:27.540
no one's leaving

00:24:27.540 --> 00:24:28.140
after work tonight.

00:24:28.740 --> 00:24:30.660
We're going to that Yunnan restaurant
I mentioned.

00:24:31.300 --> 00:24:32.140
My treat.

00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:32.940
Ms. Guan.

00:24:33.540 --> 00:24:34.900
I can't make it tonight.

00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:35.900
I have something to do at home.

00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:38.220
Another time then. Just the two of us.

00:24:38.540 --> 00:24:38.820
Okay.

00:24:40.540 --> 00:24:41.460
Anything else?

00:24:42.260 --> 00:24:43.060
Mushrooms.

00:24:43.620 --> 00:24:44.180
Feng Lexuan,

00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:47.020
why was your dad's wedding off?

00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:49.180
How should I know about adult stuff?

00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:50.500
Then ask him.

00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:51.620
Why don't you ask him?

00:24:52.180 --> 00:24:52.980
Why are you asking me?

00:24:53.660 --> 00:24:54.300
Feng Lexuan,

00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:55.740
so now you're not the one
giving me advice?

00:24:56.740 --> 00:24:58.340
I really don't know why.

00:24:59.980 --> 00:25:01.020
Because he fell out of love.

00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:05.020
Didn't know you had it in you,

00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:06.700
Yang Zihuan.

00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:09.500
I was just guessing.

00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:12.540
Could it be your dad
is still thinking about your mom?

00:25:13.540 --> 00:25:14.540
Your birth mother.

00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:16.060
Maybe.

00:25:17.060 --> 00:25:18.860
He hasn't been able to forget her
all these years?

00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:20.540
She must be really great then.

00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:22.500
I don't know.

00:25:22.820 --> 00:25:24.460
I don't even know what she looks like.

00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:35.400
[Feng Rui]

00:25:42.820 --> 00:25:44.060
I'll get straight to the point then.

00:25:45.100 --> 00:25:46.140
I'm not here today

00:25:46.140 --> 00:25:47.380
to blame you.

00:25:48.060 --> 00:25:49.580
I just want to ask you a few questions.

00:25:51.100 --> 00:25:52.020
Of course, no pressure.

00:25:52.620 --> 00:25:53.980
If you don't want to answer,

00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:55.500
you don't have to.

00:25:56.820 --> 00:25:57.380
No problem.

00:25:58.060 --> 00:25:59.060
I'll tell you

00:25:59.060 --> 00:25:59.740
whatever I know.

00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:06.340
When did you and Feng Rui get together?

00:26:08.860 --> 00:26:10.100
This time, it was

00:26:10.100 --> 00:26:12.140
when we went
to Hongyuan County in Sichuan.

00:26:17.220 --> 00:26:18.460
In the years I've known Feng Rui,

00:26:18.580 --> 00:26:19.580
I've always known

00:26:20.260 --> 00:26:21.940
he carried Le's mom in his heart.

00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:23.740
But I didn't know

00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:25.980
Le's mom is still alive,

00:26:26.820 --> 00:26:27.580
and that it is you.

00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:30.220
Otherwise,
I wouldn't have naively tried to

00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:31.820
start this relationship.

00:26:33.980 --> 00:26:35.220
So I want to know

00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:37.740
what exactly happened between you.

00:26:38.580 --> 00:26:39.380
Why did you

00:26:39.380 --> 00:26:41.300
leave Le and Feng Rui,

00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:43.420
and why have you come back now?

00:26:44.500 --> 00:26:46.500
I don't want to bow out
without knowing the reasons.

00:26:49.780 --> 00:26:50.300
Okay.

00:26:55.100 --> 00:26:55.420
Welcome...

00:26:56.420 --> 00:26:57.060
Ms. Gao?

00:27:02.780 --> 00:27:03.620
Where's Feng Rui?

00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:05.900
Where did he go?

00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:07.660
I called him,

00:27:07.820 --> 00:27:08.540
but he didn't answer.

00:27:09.340 --> 00:27:10.340
Mr. Feng isn't here.

00:27:10.820 --> 00:27:11.620
We don't know either.

00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:14.420
What do you mean you don't know?

00:27:15.220 --> 00:27:16.580
He hasn't been here
for the last couple of days.

00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:18.660
Said he's going to France
to expand the market.

00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:20.180
He's probably preparing

00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:21.140
for that lately.

00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:23.660
You didn't know?

00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:25.420
The French market?

00:27:32.740 --> 00:27:33.660
Gao Haotian?

00:27:34.780 --> 00:27:35.860
I never knew

00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:37.340
Feng Rui had an uncle.

00:27:39.340 --> 00:27:40.580
Gao Hui would never admit

00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:42.540
that she had a brother who was a rapist.

00:27:44.340 --> 00:27:45.660
So you got close to me

00:27:45.780 --> 00:27:46.740
to get back at her?

00:27:50.020 --> 00:27:51.100
Partly.

00:27:51.780 --> 00:27:52.780
But not entirely.

00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:55.780
But I must admit,

00:27:56.420 --> 00:27:58.780
I did use your relationship

00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:01.500
to find out everything

00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:02.980
I wanted to know.

00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:04.740
I'm really sorry.

00:28:07.260 --> 00:28:08.260
Having said that,

00:28:09.540 --> 00:28:11.180
I'm grateful to you.

00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:13.020
All these years,

00:28:13.580 --> 00:28:14.540
you've been there for Le,

00:28:14.780 --> 00:28:15.620
taking care of him,

00:28:16.340 --> 00:28:18.020
making up for the fact
that he didn't have a mom.

00:28:18.860 --> 00:28:20.260
You don't need to thank me, actually.

00:28:21.340 --> 00:28:23.820
It's not entirely because of Feng Rui
that I'm good to Le.

00:28:24.540 --> 00:28:26.740
Le really is a lovely child.

00:28:28.780 --> 00:28:29.940
And perhaps

00:28:30.460 --> 00:28:31.180
whom we meet in this world,

00:28:32.020 --> 00:28:33.180
when we meet them,

00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:35.540
and what kind of relationship we form,

00:28:36.700 --> 00:28:38.100
are all predestined.

00:28:43.260 --> 00:28:44.700
I've been thinking a lot lately.

00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:46.980
There were some things
I couldn't figure out.

00:28:47.860 --> 00:28:49.260
Now I've finally figured it out.

00:28:51.220 --> 00:28:51.940
It's all in the past now.

00:28:56.340 --> 00:28:57.500
And I hope he finds happiness.

00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:18.300
Are you okay?

00:29:19.180 --> 00:29:20.180
Why wouldn't I be?

00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:22.780
You didn't answer my calls.

00:29:24.420 --> 00:29:25.700
Peiyan came to see me.

00:29:29.620 --> 00:29:30.860
What did she say?

00:29:31.620 --> 00:29:32.900
She said a lot of bad things about you.

00:29:35.980 --> 00:29:36.980
Just kidding.

00:29:40.700 --> 00:29:41.580
She wanted to know why.

00:29:41.580 --> 00:29:43.180
So I told her everything.

00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:46.300
I thought she had the right

00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:47.140
to know.

00:29:50.220 --> 00:29:50.620
I'm hanging up.

00:29:51.180 --> 00:29:51.580
Bye.

00:30:07.060 --> 00:30:07.500
Dad.

00:30:08.620 --> 00:30:09.820
Did you break up with Ms. Wen

00:30:09.820 --> 00:30:11.580
because you're still thinking
about my mom?

00:30:15.540 --> 00:30:16.340
It's nothing.

00:30:16.820 --> 00:30:17.740
I was just asking.

00:30:26.460 --> 00:30:26.780
Le,

00:30:27.820 --> 00:30:29.020
do you want to go on a trip?

00:30:29.780 --> 00:30:30.260
Yes.

00:30:30.820 --> 00:30:31.260
Where to?

00:30:32.980 --> 00:30:33.380
Abroad.

00:30:34.340 --> 00:30:34.740
With who?

00:30:36.540 --> 00:30:37.460
With me, of course.

00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:39.940
Just the two of us?

00:30:42.420 --> 00:30:42.820
You don't want to?

00:30:43.860 --> 00:30:44.220
Alright.

00:30:44.860 --> 00:30:45.740
Which country?

00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:47.700
France. How about that?

00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:48.980
France?

00:30:49.660 --> 00:30:51.540
Just the two of us guys going to France?

00:30:54.060 --> 00:30:55.220
But whatever.

00:30:56.060 --> 00:30:57.780
As long as we're having fun,
anywhere is fine.

00:30:58.820 --> 00:30:59.420
How long for?

00:31:00.340 --> 00:31:01.140
How long do you want to go for?

00:31:01.580 --> 00:31:02.860
The longer, the better.

00:31:06.660 --> 00:31:07.580
But Grandma

00:31:07.580 --> 00:31:09.260
told me to focus on studying recently.

00:31:11.660 --> 00:31:12.260
True.

00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:15.060
You need to behave well.

00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:17.740
Like you need to tell me that.

00:31:33.540 --> 00:31:34.540
I had to

00:31:35.420 --> 00:31:36.980
come to the school to see you.

00:31:41.660 --> 00:31:43.940
I didn't mean to ignore your calls.

00:31:44.300 --> 00:31:45.060
I just

00:31:46.060 --> 00:31:47.220
didn't know what to say.

00:31:49.940 --> 00:31:51.460
I didn't expect things
to turn out like this.

00:31:54.140 --> 00:31:55.420
I'm sorry, Yan.

00:31:56.380 --> 00:31:56.860
Madam,

00:31:57.740 --> 00:31:59.140
you don't need to apologize to me.

00:32:00.740 --> 00:32:01.660
Matters of the heart

00:32:02.660 --> 00:32:03.820
are hard to explain.

00:32:06.620 --> 00:32:07.740
You're a good girl.

00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:09.580
And you're good to Le.

00:32:10.020 --> 00:32:11.140
I've seen it all.

00:32:12.420 --> 00:32:13.820
When I found out you two were together,

00:32:14.260 --> 00:32:15.260
I was really happy for you.

00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:17.700
You're not getting any younger.

00:32:18.940 --> 00:32:20.140
I hope you can

00:32:21.100 --> 00:32:22.140
settle down soon.

00:32:26.380 --> 00:32:28.100
Tan Siting told me everything.

00:32:35.940 --> 00:32:36.940
What did she say?

00:32:40.540 --> 00:32:42.060
It doesn't matter what she said.

00:32:42.660 --> 00:32:44.140
That's just her side of the story.

00:32:46.980 --> 00:32:48.100
I won't comment

00:32:48.780 --> 00:32:50.220
on what's between you.

00:32:51.100 --> 00:32:52.260
But now that I know

00:32:52.460 --> 00:32:53.900
Tan Siting is Le's mom,

00:32:55.020 --> 00:32:56.020
there's no way things could work out

00:32:57.580 --> 00:32:58.620
between me and Feng Rui.

00:32:58.980 --> 00:33:00.340
She just appeared

00:33:00.340 --> 00:33:02.100
in Rui's life before you did.

00:33:03.340 --> 00:33:04.420
But that's not important.

00:33:05.340 --> 00:33:06.700
They aren't right for each other.

00:33:07.220 --> 00:33:08.620
They're not meant to be.

00:33:10.140 --> 00:33:11.220
I always felt like

00:33:11.980 --> 00:33:13.260
Rui was living

00:33:14.180 --> 00:33:15.740
inside a shell.

00:33:16.580 --> 00:33:17.780
I tried hard

00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:18.780
to break through it.

00:33:20.260 --> 00:33:21.140
But unfortunately,

00:33:22.460 --> 00:33:23.660
I never managed to get inside.

00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:25.540
Yan,

00:33:26.420 --> 00:33:27.300
if you love someone,

00:33:28.180 --> 00:33:29.100
you should persevere.

00:33:29.100 --> 00:33:29.860
Don't give up.

00:33:30.540 --> 00:33:31.660
I'll help you.

00:33:50.180 --> 00:33:51.260
I've been carrying

00:33:51.540 --> 00:33:52.660
this necklace with me lately.

00:33:53.460 --> 00:33:55.180
I wanted to find the right time
to return it to you.

00:33:56.420 --> 00:33:57.140
Today seems fitting.

00:34:01.140 --> 00:34:02.300
Thank you for looking out for me

00:34:03.540 --> 00:34:04.260
all this time.

00:34:23.900 --> 00:34:24.500
Okay.

00:34:25.420 --> 00:34:27.620
Alright. We're here.

00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:28.180
Hello, Mr. Lu.

00:34:28.180 --> 00:34:28.620
Le.

00:34:29.660 --> 00:34:30.100
Mr. Feng.

00:34:30.100 --> 00:34:30.500
Lu.

00:34:31.220 --> 00:34:31.820
I'll take it.

00:34:35.660 --> 00:34:36.820
Dad, aren't you coming home?

00:34:37.660 --> 00:34:38.420
I still have some things
to take care of.

00:34:38.780 --> 00:34:40.340
I'll come back as soon as I'm done.

00:34:40.660 --> 00:34:41.060
Okay.

00:34:41.220 --> 00:34:42.500
Alright. Go upstairs with Lu.

00:34:42.980 --> 00:34:43.780
Okay. Bye.

00:34:43.780 --> 00:34:44.060
Bye.

00:34:51.700 --> 00:34:52.740
Hello, Ms. Tan.

00:34:53.180 --> 00:34:54.700
Guess what my dad told me today?

00:34:55.020 --> 00:34:55.780
What did he say?

00:34:56.180 --> 00:34:57.580
He said if I behave well,

00:34:57.580 --> 00:34:58.980
he'll take me to France.

00:35:00.340 --> 00:35:00.900
Really?

00:35:01.580 --> 00:35:03.220
Then you better behave well.

00:35:04.460 --> 00:35:05.020
Ms. Tan,

00:35:05.420 --> 00:35:07.420
I remember you used to
live in France, right?

00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:08.340
Yeah.

00:35:09.820 --> 00:35:11.780
Then you can be my remote tour guide.

00:35:12.140 --> 00:35:13.620
I want to see if French ballet

00:35:13.620 --> 00:35:14.700
is really as amazing as they say.

00:35:15.100 --> 00:35:16.380
Of course, no problem.

00:35:17.060 --> 00:35:17.860
Alright. Come eat.

00:35:22.580 --> 00:35:22.940
Hello?

00:35:23.580 --> 00:35:24.500
Who's at your house?

00:35:26.580 --> 00:35:28.340
Two of my colleagues came over
for dinner.

00:35:29.660 --> 00:35:30.900
Then you should eat.

00:35:31.940 --> 00:35:32.300
Le,

00:35:32.580 --> 00:35:34.220
can you give me your home address?

00:35:34.220 --> 00:35:35.580
I want to send you a gift.

00:35:36.180 --> 00:35:36.820
A gift?

00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:39.700
Thanks, Ms. Tan.

00:35:40.100 --> 00:35:41.140
No problem. I'm hanging up now.

00:35:41.380 --> 00:35:41.820
Bye.

00:35:46.580 --> 00:35:47.140
He didn't hear, did he?

00:35:47.660 --> 00:35:49.220
I was so scared.

00:35:49.940 --> 00:35:50.900
He almost heard.

00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:51.900
Good thing he didn't
recognize your voice.

00:35:51.980 --> 00:35:53.740
Why did you ask for his address?

00:35:53.740 --> 00:35:54.660
You could have just asked me.

00:35:55.420 --> 00:35:56.940
Are you silly?

00:35:59.060 --> 00:35:59.380
Right.

00:36:00.260 --> 00:36:00.580
Right.

00:36:49.060 --> 00:36:49.540
Is he asleep?

00:36:53.500 --> 00:36:54.220
You should just sleep here too.

00:36:54.740 --> 00:36:55.660
No need to go back and forth.

00:37:08.420 --> 00:37:09.660
Your grandpa misses you.

00:37:10.420 --> 00:37:11.820
He wants you to come over
for dinner tomorrow.

00:37:14.900 --> 00:37:15.380
I see.

00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:30.260
It's been a long time

00:37:31.420 --> 00:37:33.780
since our whole family
had a proper meal together.

00:37:34.860 --> 00:37:35.420
Rui,

00:37:36.540 --> 00:37:37.940
how is your winery doing?

00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:40.220
It's good.

00:37:40.660 --> 00:37:42.220
Cygne is on track now.

00:37:43.060 --> 00:37:43.860
Our vineyard

00:37:43.860 --> 00:37:45.380
is gradually increasing production.

00:37:45.780 --> 00:37:47.500
We've also seen
a significant growth in orders.

00:37:48.620 --> 00:37:49.620
You're doing very well.

00:37:50.940 --> 00:37:51.780
You always

00:37:52.580 --> 00:37:54.540
put my mind at ease
when it comes to work.

00:37:58.940 --> 00:37:59.540
Rui,

00:38:02.700 --> 00:38:03.420
your mom

00:38:05.340 --> 00:38:06.540
told me about your situation.

00:38:07.540 --> 00:38:08.260
Young people

00:38:08.820 --> 00:38:11.260
tend to be impulsive
in matters of the heart.

00:38:12.060 --> 00:38:12.860
It's understandable.

00:38:14.060 --> 00:38:15.540
But the engagement thing

00:38:16.060 --> 00:38:17.540
is truly beyond repair now.

00:38:18.660 --> 00:38:19.220
I understand.

00:38:20.820 --> 00:38:22.780
You have feelings for Ms. Tan.

00:38:24.540 --> 00:38:25.540
But your relationship

00:38:25.780 --> 00:38:26.700
is too complicated.

00:38:27.420 --> 00:38:28.860
Ms. Tan is different from you.

00:38:29.420 --> 00:38:31.060
You're not just on your own.

00:38:31.780 --> 00:38:32.700
You have a large family

00:38:33.340 --> 00:38:34.620
and a business

00:38:35.540 --> 00:38:36.540
behind you.

00:38:36.820 --> 00:38:39.260
You should understand the implications.

00:38:41.420 --> 00:38:41.820
Grandpa.

00:38:42.660 --> 00:38:44.260
I understand everything you're saying.

00:38:45.260 --> 00:38:46.540
When it comes to love, you young people

00:38:47.460 --> 00:38:49.100
tend to disregard
everyone else's feelings.

00:38:55.300 --> 00:38:57.380
You're the ones overcomplicating things.

00:38:58.300 --> 00:38:59.380
It's actually very simple.

00:39:00.540 --> 00:39:01.700
In our relationship,

00:39:03.540 --> 00:39:04.740
it's just her and me.

00:39:05.540 --> 00:39:06.740
Besides, we're not that young anymore.

00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:10.420
We really don't want to

00:39:12.020 --> 00:39:13.860
carry on the grudges from the past.

00:39:17.900 --> 00:39:19.540
It's not a matter of what you want.

00:39:20.020 --> 00:39:20.580
Rui,

00:39:21.100 --> 00:39:21.740
let me ask you,

00:39:23.260 --> 00:39:24.380
are you still visiting Haotian's grave

00:39:24.740 --> 00:39:25.980
on the anniversary of his death?

00:39:26.620 --> 00:39:27.100
And

00:39:28.020 --> 00:39:29.300
they probably haven't

00:39:29.740 --> 00:39:31.380
forgotten about that girl's death,
have they?

00:39:39.940 --> 00:39:42.620
Siting and I have decided.

00:39:43.860 --> 00:39:46.100
We're not running away anymore.

00:39:48.060 --> 00:39:49.820
If I can't marry her,

00:39:50.060 --> 00:39:51.620
I don't think I'll ever marry anyone.

00:40:00.300 --> 00:40:01.180
Let's eat.

00:40:12.900 --> 00:40:14.300
Let me introduce you all.

00:40:14.620 --> 00:40:16.540
This is my boyfriend, Wu Zuhao.

00:40:16.860 --> 00:40:17.660
You can call him Zu.

00:40:18.460 --> 00:40:18.860
Oh, Zu,

00:40:19.140 --> 00:40:21.340
this is my best friend, Tan Siting.

00:40:21.820 --> 00:40:22.540
A great artist.

00:40:23.220 --> 00:40:24.540
Shuhan talks about you a lot.

00:40:24.980 --> 00:40:26.860
You're an internationally renowned
ballet dancer.

00:40:27.300 --> 00:40:27.860
It's an honor.

00:40:28.300 --> 00:40:29.220
She's exaggerating.

00:40:29.540 --> 00:40:31.180
She's also told me a lot about you.

00:40:33.180 --> 00:40:33.860
You're head over heels.

00:40:35.980 --> 00:40:36.460
Oh,

00:40:36.860 --> 00:40:38.860
and Siting's boyfriend
is also in business.

00:40:38.980 --> 00:40:40.060
He sells wine.

00:40:40.220 --> 00:40:41.660
I'll introduce you sometime.

00:40:42.100 --> 00:40:42.540
- Okay.
- Of course.

00:40:44.780 --> 00:40:45.060
Sorry,

00:40:45.060 --> 00:40:46.460
I almost forgot my dearest brother.

00:40:46.860 --> 00:40:47.420
This is Wang Zeyuan.

00:40:48.420 --> 00:40:48.860
Hello.

00:40:49.580 --> 00:40:50.140
Zu said...

00:40:50.140 --> 00:40:50.860
This is my business card.

00:40:50.980 --> 00:40:52.060
today is the first time he's meeting

00:40:52.060 --> 00:40:53.980
the two most important people
in my life.

00:40:54.180 --> 00:40:56.660
So he insisted
that today's dinner must be

00:40:56.860 --> 00:40:57.420
proper

00:40:57.620 --> 00:40:58.220
and grand.

00:40:58.620 --> 00:40:59.980
Today is our first time meeting.

00:41:00.180 --> 00:41:01.300
It's a pleasure to meet you both.

00:41:01.740 --> 00:41:02.900
Hope everyone enjoys the meal.

00:41:04.260 --> 00:41:04.780
Thank you.

00:41:12.340 --> 00:41:12.860
Wang Shuhan,

00:41:13.420 --> 00:41:14.620
you seem really busy lately.

00:41:15.180 --> 00:41:15.780
You're not even answering calls.

00:41:16.340 --> 00:41:17.180
What big project are you working on?

00:41:17.380 --> 00:41:18.780
Is that how you address me?

00:41:19.060 --> 00:41:19.660
Watch your tone

00:41:19.660 --> 00:41:21.180
when you're talking to me.

00:41:23.020 --> 00:41:23.420
Uh,

00:41:24.260 --> 00:41:24.820
sorry about that.

00:41:24.940 --> 00:41:25.900
Even though I'm his elder sister,

00:41:26.060 --> 00:41:28.180
he never shows me any respect at home.

00:41:28.700 --> 00:41:29.820
Siting, talk some sense into him.

00:41:30.820 --> 00:41:32.020
How enviable.

00:41:32.180 --> 00:41:32.900
It's so nice.

00:41:33.180 --> 00:41:34.660
I wish I had a younger brother
to protect

00:41:34.660 --> 00:41:35.300
and care for me.

00:41:35.300 --> 00:41:35.820
Right?

00:41:38.820 --> 00:41:39.180
Here.

00:41:39.300 --> 00:41:39.820
Let's eat.

00:41:39.940 --> 00:41:40.300
Okay.

00:42:02.900 --> 00:42:03.620
Can you confirm?

00:42:08.380 --> 00:42:08.860
We're still investigating

00:42:08.860 --> 00:42:09.700
the specifics.

00:42:10.060 --> 00:42:11.420
Please come with me to the station later

00:42:11.540 --> 00:42:12.260
to give your statements.

00:42:15.940 --> 00:42:16.340
Okay.

00:42:17.660 --> 00:42:18.380
Haotian.

00:42:19.820 --> 00:42:20.580
What's wrong?

00:42:21.020 --> 00:42:21.660
Gao Hui.

00:42:22.260 --> 00:42:23.100
Gao Hui, you... Calm down.

00:42:23.100 --> 00:42:23.940
Haotian.

00:42:23.940 --> 00:42:24.740
Calm down, Gao Hui.

00:42:24.900 --> 00:42:26.140
What happened?

00:42:28.020 --> 00:42:28.780
Haotian,

00:42:29.420 --> 00:42:30.660
tell me!

00:42:31.380 --> 00:42:32.740
What happened?

00:42:32.740 --> 00:42:34.460
- Mom.
- Calm down. Gao Hui!

00:42:35.260 --> 00:42:36.140
Haotian!

00:42:38.820 --> 00:42:40.700
What happened?

00:42:40.900 --> 00:42:42.100
Tell me!

00:42:44.140 --> 00:42:45.260
Alright, Gao Hui.

00:42:45.780 --> 00:42:46.700
Gao Hui, that's enough.

00:42:47.740 --> 00:42:49.060
Haotian.

00:42:49.420 --> 00:42:49.700
Mom.

00:42:51.220 --> 00:42:52.540
Come home with me!

00:42:54.740 --> 00:42:56.620
Come home with me!

00:42:58.420 --> 00:42:59.300
Haotian!

00:42:59.300 --> 00:43:00.500
Gao Hui, that's enough.

00:43:00.500 --> 00:43:01.740
Haotian!
