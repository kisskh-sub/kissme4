{\an8}'JARIM'S SON-IN-LAW,' CHO JIN-EON,
HAS AN AFFAIR WITH ACTRESS AN DA-HYE

DONGWOON DAILY

00:01:28.694 --> 00:01:29.695
- Hi.
- Hello.

00:01:40.372 --> 00:01:42.207
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

00:01:42.291 --> 00:01:43.125
Hello.

00:01:43.208 --> 00:01:46.211
What do you mean I'm not at work
when I just clocked out?

00:01:46.295 --> 00:01:48.088
You know I worked all night long.

00:01:48.964 --> 00:01:51.592
{\an8}I even put the cursor
on the submit button.

00:01:52.343 --> 00:01:55.179
{\an8}Tell that idiot department manager
to just click on that.

00:01:56.096 --> 00:01:58.599
{\an8}And tell her that this idiot
assistant manager is at breakfast.

00:02:00.017 --> 00:02:04.146
{\an8}Has… the article been uploaded?

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.358
{\an8}However, it is questionable to say
whether they actually helped

00:02:07.441 --> 00:02:11.195
{\an8}in reducing damage
or showed any physical measures.

00:02:11.779 --> 00:02:14.114
{\an8}The level of fine dust is worrisome…

00:02:14.198 --> 00:02:15.240
{\an8}Okay.

00:02:15.324 --> 00:02:17.451
{\an8}Our government and the US NASA…

00:02:21.872 --> 00:02:23.582
{\an8}The analysis says it is highly…

00:02:23.666 --> 00:02:26.502
Assistant Manager,
the article on An Da-hye's been posted.

00:02:26.585 --> 00:02:28.545
…up to 71%.

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:32.508
It was mostly influenced by Shandong,
which is in the same latitude.

00:02:32.591 --> 00:02:35.761
Today, the Central Bank's
Monetary Policy Committee

00:02:35.844 --> 00:02:37.596
set the fixed interest rate at 3.9%.

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.684
The economic growth rate
appears to be 2.6%,

00:02:41.767 --> 00:02:43.936
which is 0.2 points higher
than three months ago.

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:46.981
As the economy is becoming stable…

00:02:47.064 --> 00:02:50.401
What a great morning
to start drinking again

00:02:50.484 --> 00:02:54.113
after I quit because of you, Seo Ji-woo.

00:02:57.408 --> 00:02:58.617
It's hot!

00:02:59.493 --> 00:03:00.494
Damn it!

00:03:01.578 --> 00:03:04.373
Actress An Da-hye's alleged affair
raises suspicion.

00:03:04.456 --> 00:03:07.501
{\an8}The man involved
is the second son of conglomerate A.

00:03:07.584 --> 00:03:10.504
{\an8}The main issue
is the suspicion of An Da-hye's drug use.

00:03:10.587 --> 00:03:12.881
{\an8}I'll cooperate fully
with the investigation.

00:03:14.008 --> 00:03:15.843
{\an8}When An was taking drugs…

00:03:15.926 --> 00:03:18.554
{\an8}Seochang Group's second son, Cho Jin-eon…

00:03:18.637 --> 00:03:20.431
{\an8}Fuck off. Get that out of my sight.

00:03:20.514 --> 00:03:22.808
- The prosecution is investigating.
- Cho's wife, Seo…

00:03:22.891 --> 00:03:25.477
- Even to Seo Ji-woo…
- Seo Ji-woo's husband, Cho…

00:03:25.561 --> 00:03:27.354
JARIM Apparel's second daughter…

00:03:27.438 --> 00:03:29.231
- Seo has…
- JARIM's second daughter…

00:03:29.314 --> 00:03:31.483
- Seo's marriage is…
- An Da-hye did drugs.

00:03:31.567 --> 00:03:34.069
It could become an owner-level risk
for JARIM Apparel.

00:03:34.153 --> 00:03:36.405
- Seo Ji-woo's JARIM Apparel…
- Seo Ji-woo is…

00:03:36.488 --> 00:03:38.073
The public is paying attention.

00:03:39.742 --> 00:03:41.535
Now that I've lived long enough,

00:03:41.618 --> 00:03:44.038
I wonder how one's life
can be that turbulent.

00:03:44.747 --> 00:03:47.666
I mean, why can't she just live quietly?

00:03:48.625 --> 00:03:51.712
Why did she have to marry
a jerk like him of all men? Jeez.

00:03:55.924 --> 00:03:57.259
You know what?

00:03:57.342 --> 00:03:58.886
I yelled at my manager

00:03:58.969 --> 00:04:02.097
that this is a current affairs piece,
not entertainment.

00:04:02.181 --> 00:04:05.100
He'll end up at his father-in-law's
JARIM Apparel anyway.

00:04:05.184 --> 00:04:07.770
How is this entertainment?
Am I wrong, Se-yeong?

00:04:07.853 --> 00:04:10.022
Are you seriously asking me?

00:04:10.105 --> 00:04:13.609
You need a top actress to blow it up.

00:04:13.692 --> 00:04:16.737
He's just upset.
You really think he doesn't know?

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:18.739
Why ask if he already knows?

00:04:18.822 --> 00:04:21.033
He just wants comfort, got it?

00:04:21.116 --> 00:04:24.787
"I did my best.
It wasn't me who ruined Ji-woo's life."

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.372
This isn't the first time
her life's been ruined.

00:04:27.456 --> 00:04:28.957
And she's firm.

00:04:29.041 --> 00:04:31.919
Meanwhile, unsteady Kyeong-do
is pouring a morning drink.

00:04:33.796 --> 00:04:36.215
Se-yeong, you know
I quit drinking when I was 30.

00:04:36.298 --> 00:04:39.635
Why did you call us
if you're only going to talk to Se-yeong?

00:04:39.718 --> 00:04:43.347
Hey, punk, because Se-yeong is
the most reasonable among us, you idiot.

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:45.891
- Are you saying I'm…
- Hey, will you shut up?

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:48.936
Are you going to drink?

00:04:58.112 --> 00:04:59.113
Kyeong-do.

00:05:00.114 --> 00:05:01.073
- Are you scared?
- I am.

00:05:01.156 --> 00:05:02.866
- You want me to call her?
- No.

00:05:03.367 --> 00:05:05.077
Don't you do that, Se-yeong.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.789
And by chance, if she calls you,
don't give her my number.

00:05:08.872 --> 00:05:10.082
You know that, right--

00:05:16.004 --> 00:05:17.381
What's up with this timing?

00:05:19.091 --> 00:05:20.300
MANAGER JIN HAN-KYEONG

00:05:20.384 --> 00:05:22.136
Oh, it's the department manager.

00:05:23.178 --> 00:05:24.096
Hello?

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:26.431
What? Okay.

00:05:29.268 --> 00:05:30.102
Bye.

00:05:30.644 --> 00:05:32.062
- You're leaving?
- What?

00:05:32.146 --> 00:05:34.773
- After calling us all here?
- My work is calling me back.

00:05:34.857 --> 00:05:36.984
I turned back from a business trip
to see you.

00:05:39.153 --> 00:05:40.612
Gosh.

00:05:49.955 --> 00:05:50.914
What?

00:05:50.998 --> 00:05:53.709
I heard you had soju with your breakfast.

00:05:53.792 --> 00:05:56.795
- So?
- You won't even have a beer with us.

00:05:56.879 --> 00:05:59.548
- I'm disappointed.
- Didn't you hear? It was just a bottle.

00:05:59.631 --> 00:06:01.758
Why order it if you won't drink it?

00:06:01.842 --> 00:06:03.760
- By the way--
- No personal questions.

00:06:04.678 --> 00:06:07.890
Please go to a sauna,
or at least the shower room.

00:06:07.973 --> 00:06:09.933
You smell like a widower. Okay?

00:06:12.811 --> 00:06:13.812
What is this?

00:06:13.896 --> 00:06:15.480
Return to your seat

00:06:15.564 --> 00:06:18.650
and enjoy watching
the surprised emojis on your article.

00:06:18.734 --> 00:06:19.860
Okay.

00:06:21.528 --> 00:06:25.407
An article on An Da-hye
made him drink soju.

00:06:27.492 --> 00:06:28.785
Did you date An Da-hye?

00:06:33.624 --> 00:06:36.001
I've seen many stuck on their first love,

00:06:36.084 --> 00:06:38.629
but you're the only one
who couldn't move on for 18 years.

00:06:38.712 --> 00:06:40.339
Am I right, Lee Kyeong-do?

00:06:40.422 --> 00:06:42.925
You're making up a story.

00:06:43.008 --> 00:06:46.637
You're not worried
about An Da-hye or her affair.

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:47.638
Stop it, seriously.

00:06:47.721 --> 00:06:50.182
Did you drink soju in the morning

00:06:50.265 --> 00:06:53.602
because you were worried about
the wife of An Da-hye's man?

00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:57.856
It's humanism.

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:01.151
Hey, did you date Seo Ji-woo?

00:07:01.235 --> 00:07:02.319
Use my title, idiot.

00:07:02.402 --> 00:07:04.863
Assistant Manager,
did you really date Seo Ji-woo?

00:07:05.364 --> 00:07:07.991
Have you ever bitten this before?
Try it today.

00:07:08.075 --> 00:07:09.534
You know what happens then?

00:07:09.618 --> 00:07:11.536
He'll write an article with his fingers.

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:12.496
Go to a sauna.

00:07:15.624 --> 00:07:16.458
What is that?

00:07:16.541 --> 00:07:19.169
- Go away. Go. Seriously.
- Okay.

00:07:32.099 --> 00:07:33.684
Intern, aren't you going home?

00:07:34.476 --> 00:07:35.894
I'm about to.

00:07:35.978 --> 00:07:36.812
Yeah?

00:07:52.703 --> 00:07:54.079
SEO JI-WOO

00:08:01.628 --> 00:08:03.255
JARIM APPAREL'S SEO JI-WOO

00:08:13.307 --> 00:08:18.103
SPRING, 2007

00:08:19.563 --> 00:08:20.397
Hello?

00:08:22.941 --> 00:08:26.361
How do I wait for an hour?
There's nothing but buildings here.

00:08:28.113 --> 00:08:29.573
Oh, I don't know.

00:08:30.782 --> 00:08:33.660
Call me when you're off then. Bye.

00:08:58.727 --> 00:08:59.728
What the…

00:09:00.854 --> 00:09:01.688
Where did it go?

00:09:09.154 --> 00:09:10.072
What the heck?

00:09:12.449 --> 00:09:13.283
What are you doing?

00:09:14.034 --> 00:09:16.453
- I lost a 500-won coin.
- Just come already.

00:09:16.536 --> 00:09:19.039
But I need that
for a banana-flavored milk.

00:09:19.122 --> 00:09:21.208
Why did it have to be a 500-won coin?

00:09:21.291 --> 00:09:22.626
Gosh.

00:09:25.212 --> 00:09:26.296
Hurry up!

00:09:30.675 --> 00:09:31.551
Damn it.

00:10:13.218 --> 00:10:14.219
SURELY TOMORROW

00:10:14.302 --> 00:10:16.138
EPISODE 1

00:10:23.228 --> 00:10:26.314
JUWON UNIVERSITY CLUB FESTIVAL

00:10:30.610 --> 00:10:34.239
All students of Juwon,
join the comedy club!

00:10:46.585 --> 00:10:47.711
You over there.

00:10:50.589 --> 00:10:52.132
- Me?
- Decided which club to join yet?

00:10:52.883 --> 00:10:54.801
I'm not joining any club.

00:10:55.594 --> 00:10:56.678
Okay.

00:10:57.721 --> 00:10:59.931
Then why don't you come
and have a seat here?

00:11:05.562 --> 00:11:07.981
Oh, it's an acting club?

00:11:08.064 --> 00:11:09.691
Once you hear the history of Chaos--

00:11:09.774 --> 00:11:11.318
I'm not into acting.

00:11:11.401 --> 00:11:13.195
Oh, actually, neither am I.

00:11:13.278 --> 00:11:14.279
Have a good day.

00:11:14.362 --> 00:11:16.364
Not so fast. You can't just leave.

00:11:17.532 --> 00:11:18.366
What?

00:11:19.701 --> 00:11:21.953
Will you sit here just for five minutes?

00:11:23.538 --> 00:11:24.372
Me?

00:11:26.791 --> 00:11:30.128
Because I have to go poop,
and I can't leave here unattended.

00:11:30.212 --> 00:11:31.463
Can you stay here for a second?

00:11:31.546 --> 00:11:33.965
Well, that is kind of…

00:11:34.049 --> 00:11:36.176
Oh, my stomach.

00:11:37.219 --> 00:11:40.472
You know if I end up pooping here,
I won't just let it slide, okay?

00:11:40.555 --> 00:11:42.557
But I'm just a passerby…

00:11:42.641 --> 00:11:45.268
If anyone comes,
give the application form to them.

00:11:45.352 --> 00:11:46.353
- But…
- Thanks!

00:11:47.521 --> 00:11:48.730
Oh, I almost pooped.

00:12:00.325 --> 00:12:04.955
If it's an acting club,
do you put on a play too?

00:12:06.414 --> 00:12:09.334
Don't tell me… A newbie?

00:12:10.252 --> 00:12:13.129
What makes you say "Don't tell me"?

00:12:14.047 --> 00:12:15.257
Do you need a mirror?

00:12:19.302 --> 00:12:20.804
- Fill it out.
- What?

00:12:20.887 --> 00:12:22.138
CHAOS CLUB APPLICATION FORM

00:12:23.056 --> 00:12:24.599
You just told me to look in the mirror.

00:12:24.683 --> 00:12:26.768
I meant you look old
for your age, not ugly.

00:12:26.851 --> 00:12:28.645
You're perfect for the lead role.

00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:37.988
You have a weird way of talking.

00:12:46.663 --> 00:12:48.790
{\an8}NAME - LEE KYEONG-DO

00:12:49.457 --> 00:12:54.212
Your name is Lee Kyeong-do?
As in latitude and longitude?

00:12:57.465 --> 00:13:00.552
{\an8}Journalism and broadcasting major?
Want to be a producer?

00:13:02.345 --> 00:13:05.140
Are you a senior? Why do you talk like--

00:13:07.225 --> 00:13:08.268
I got you one.

00:13:08.852 --> 00:13:10.186
Is it ultimately about beauty?

00:13:10.270 --> 00:13:12.439
I sat here for two days,
but I got nothing.

00:13:12.522 --> 00:13:14.649
Beauty? Who?

00:13:15.525 --> 00:13:16.860
How rude when we just met.

00:13:16.943 --> 00:13:19.029
You dropped the honorifics to me first.
Get a grip.

00:13:19.112 --> 00:13:23.408
Hey, why raise voices between newbies?

00:13:23.491 --> 00:13:24.326
A newbie?

00:13:24.409 --> 00:13:26.786
What? Did I say I was a senior?

00:13:29.706 --> 00:13:30.540
No.

00:13:30.624 --> 00:13:34.753
Then why are you making a damn fuss?
Bye now.

00:13:39.883 --> 00:13:42.510
All right. Write down your number.

00:13:42.594 --> 00:13:43.803
Let me catch her first.

00:13:43.887 --> 00:13:44.888
Hey.

00:13:45.472 --> 00:13:46.514
What?

00:13:48.558 --> 00:13:49.392
Are we done now?

00:13:49.476 --> 00:13:52.395
- No, no. Your email as well.
- What? Email? Email…

00:13:53.772 --> 00:13:56.358
- Are we done now? Bye.
- Yes, thanks.

00:13:56.441 --> 00:13:58.735
Good luck. I'll call you!

00:13:58.818 --> 00:14:00.028
A make-up class?

00:14:01.112 --> 00:14:03.615
Gosh, why are you studying so hard?

00:14:04.991 --> 00:14:06.409
Whatever, I'm leaving.

00:14:07.619 --> 00:14:09.245
I'll just see you in Apgujeong.

00:14:09.329 --> 00:14:10.372
Hey, newbie!

00:14:12.957 --> 00:14:15.835
Hey, but your school is pretty fun.
I'm hanging up.

00:14:19.631 --> 00:14:22.801
Hey, since you were rude to me,
you need to apologize.

00:14:22.884 --> 00:14:26.304
Let's face it. You look old.
I bet you hear that a lot.

00:14:28.598 --> 00:14:31.851
It's the first time.
And who are you to judge me?

00:14:33.019 --> 00:14:36.189
I was only expressing
what I saw and what I felt.

00:14:37.023 --> 00:14:38.775
You're getting unnecessarily angry.

00:14:40.443 --> 00:14:44.197
You're living in your own world.
Do you seriously think that?

00:14:46.866 --> 00:14:47.992
You're laughing?

00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:52.580
I'm bored. Do you want to grab a drink?

00:14:54.082 --> 00:14:56.501
Hey, don't you have common sense?

00:14:56.584 --> 00:15:01.381
So let's decide over a drink
if I'm clueless or if you indeed look old.

00:15:01.464 --> 00:15:04.592
Hey, the sun is still high up,
and I have a class.

00:15:04.676 --> 00:15:05.677
You're that upright?

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:09.681
A student studying at school
isn't being upright, but it's a given.

00:15:10.598 --> 00:15:11.433
Oh, whatever.

00:15:12.517 --> 00:15:15.854
Latitude, longitude, Kyeong-do.
Let's make a globe together in peace.

00:15:15.937 --> 00:15:18.690
Hey, what's your name then? What's yours?

00:15:18.773 --> 00:15:21.401
After the first toast,
I'll show you my ID.

00:15:21.943 --> 00:15:25.071
By any chance, are you a light drinker?

00:15:29.659 --> 00:15:31.786
Hey. That's ridiculous.

00:15:31.870 --> 00:15:34.748
I could line up empty bottles
all the way to your house.

00:15:34.831 --> 00:15:35.665
Want to see?

00:15:35.749 --> 00:15:36.916
But I live in Busan.

00:15:39.461 --> 00:15:40.587
Your hometown?

00:15:41.254 --> 00:15:44.382
It's a lie, you idiot.
Let's go. I'll line up the bottles.

00:15:49.053 --> 00:15:50.305
Damn it.

00:15:53.475 --> 00:15:54.434
Cheers.

00:16:03.943 --> 00:16:05.612
I'm Ji-woo. Seo Ji-woo.

00:16:05.695 --> 00:16:06.529
What major?

00:16:13.203 --> 00:16:14.204
Cheers.

00:16:29.427 --> 00:16:30.428
English literature.

00:16:30.512 --> 00:16:32.931
Hey, did you retake the college exam
three times?

00:16:33.014 --> 00:16:35.016
You definitely seem older than me.

00:16:35.767 --> 00:16:37.393
I've looked like this since grade 7.

00:16:37.477 --> 00:16:39.771
This isn't Yonsei or Korea U.
Why repeat three times?

00:16:41.022 --> 00:16:43.900
Jeez, you sounded like my mom.
You're so fucking annoying.

00:16:43.983 --> 00:16:45.026
A penalty shot for you.

00:16:52.742 --> 00:16:53.576
Too much?

00:16:55.245 --> 00:16:56.871
I'll play along, kid.

00:17:06.339 --> 00:17:07.173
It's sweet.

00:17:08.383 --> 00:17:10.093
Excuse me. One more soju, please.

00:17:10.677 --> 00:17:11.928
It's so sweet.

00:17:21.145 --> 00:17:22.146
It's no use.

00:17:26.276 --> 00:17:28.361
The school shuttle
has stopped running for the night.

00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:32.866
Kyeong-do can't go home.

00:17:35.159 --> 00:17:36.494
Do you want me to sleep with you?

00:17:44.294 --> 00:17:45.128
Were you excited?

00:17:46.963 --> 00:17:48.172
See you.

00:17:52.886 --> 00:17:54.888
Gosh, seriously…

00:18:00.602 --> 00:18:01.436
Shit.

00:18:03.730 --> 00:18:06.357
Shit. That maniac, seriously.

00:18:15.199 --> 00:18:16.701
- Hey, Mr. Kim.
- Gosh.

00:18:19.412 --> 00:18:20.413
Go easy on the drinking.

00:18:24.709 --> 00:18:26.169
- Okay.
- Can you tell?

00:18:26.252 --> 00:18:28.630
Your booze smell's getting me drunk.
I'd fail a breath test.

00:18:30.048 --> 00:18:31.049
What about your car?

00:18:31.925 --> 00:18:33.384
My friend took it.

00:18:34.636 --> 00:18:37.805
Anyway, what were you doing here?

00:18:39.223 --> 00:18:40.892
You know Ha-yeong, right?

00:18:40.975 --> 00:18:43.436
- Your friend from the US?
- Yes, her.

00:18:43.519 --> 00:18:45.146
She goes to this school.

00:18:45.229 --> 00:18:47.815
I was here to meet her…

00:18:51.235 --> 00:18:54.155
Oh, but this school is so fun.

00:18:54.739 --> 00:18:57.492
- Should I go here instead?
- What about your school in the US?

00:18:58.785 --> 00:19:01.037
Oh, whatever. I'm going to sleep.

00:19:13.883 --> 00:19:15.677
Newbie. Hey.

00:19:19.347 --> 00:19:20.556
Oh, thank you.

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:21.891
Let's go.

00:19:22.725 --> 00:19:24.143
What? Where?

00:19:24.227 --> 00:19:26.104
- Do you live on your own?
- No.

00:19:26.187 --> 00:19:28.231
- Are you taking a taxi?
- No.

00:19:28.898 --> 00:19:30.900
Then drink more!

00:19:30.984 --> 00:19:34.195
Let's go!

00:19:35.113 --> 00:19:38.533
Come with us. Let's go.

00:19:54.799 --> 00:19:55.675
Just go home, Woo-sik.

00:19:55.758 --> 00:19:58.011
Why crash in the club room? We have homes.

00:19:58.094 --> 00:20:00.805
And leave Kyeong-do alone?
Didn't I sound cool?

00:20:03.725 --> 00:20:05.143
Do I look old?

00:20:05.226 --> 00:20:06.144
You're helpless.

00:20:06.227 --> 00:20:07.562
That's why he's with us.

00:20:07.645 --> 00:20:09.355
What? Did someone say you look old?

00:20:10.481 --> 00:20:11.315
Was it a girl?

00:20:14.569 --> 00:20:15.403
No…

00:20:17.572 --> 00:20:19.282
Do you think she's interested in me?

00:20:19.365 --> 00:20:21.492
- But she said you look old.
- Yes.

00:20:21.576 --> 00:20:24.954
Can you tell a girl you're interested in
that she looks old?

00:20:25.538 --> 00:20:26.372
No.

00:20:32.795 --> 00:20:33.796
Were you excited?

00:20:34.547 --> 00:20:35.381
Shit…

00:20:37.133 --> 00:20:39.552
Hey, where are you going?
Senior, where are you going?

00:21:33.106 --> 00:21:34.857
Did you take care of the hangover?

00:21:36.859 --> 00:21:37.819
Get out of my sight.

00:21:38.653 --> 00:21:39.487
Let's go.

00:21:39.570 --> 00:21:43.032
Go… Hey, go where?
The class is about to start soon.

00:21:43.116 --> 00:21:45.326
- That's why we have to go now.
- Go where?

00:21:47.161 --> 00:21:48.412
Hey, hey, but…

00:22:05.429 --> 00:22:07.640
- Why are you doing this to me?
- I said, see you.

00:22:07.723 --> 00:22:10.101
This is too one-sided. What do you want?

00:22:10.184 --> 00:22:11.978
- Where did you sleep last night?
- Why care?

00:22:12.061 --> 00:22:13.604
- We're not strangers.
- Then what are we?

00:22:15.231 --> 00:22:17.275
We almost slept together.

00:22:17.358 --> 00:22:18.192
What?

00:22:21.863 --> 00:22:26.409
No. That's not true.
Are you out of your mind?

00:22:27.034 --> 00:22:30.121
Maybe I am. You look handsome to me.

00:22:30.705 --> 00:22:31.539
What?

00:22:35.209 --> 00:22:37.211
If you keep acting up, I'll get mad.

00:22:37.295 --> 00:22:38.296
You're so fucking cute.

00:22:38.379 --> 00:22:39.922
Oh, can't you speak without swearing?

00:22:40.006 --> 00:22:41.591
Where did you sleep?

00:22:41.674 --> 00:22:45.469
I slept in the club room with strangers
because of you.

00:22:45.553 --> 00:22:47.805
Did you join Chaos? I should join too.

00:22:48.806 --> 00:22:51.184
Don't, or I'm going to withdraw.

00:22:55.229 --> 00:22:58.024
- How many classes do you have today?
- Why do you ask?

00:22:58.107 --> 00:22:59.108
Mind your own business.

00:22:59.192 --> 00:23:00.735
- Let's drink.
- Drink?

00:23:00.818 --> 00:23:03.988
Hey, I feel like throwing up
whenever I see green because of you.

00:23:04.071 --> 00:23:05.281
I'll see you later.

00:23:05.364 --> 00:23:08.075
When your class is over,
is it 5 p.m.? 6 p.m.?

00:23:09.243 --> 00:23:10.578
See you in the club room.

00:23:10.661 --> 00:23:12.663
Gosh, get lost.

00:23:14.248 --> 00:23:15.917
- Stop talking back.
- Talking back…

00:23:19.378 --> 00:23:21.923
Jesus. That…

00:23:22.006 --> 00:23:23.382
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:23:30.264 --> 00:23:32.099
Damn it, she ordered two.

00:23:32.183 --> 00:23:36.479
All right, today, we talked about
how media affects our consciousness

00:23:36.562 --> 00:23:40.816
when we view it as a medium
and a technical ecology.

00:23:41.984 --> 00:23:47.198
By next class,
make sure to read Chapter 3,

00:23:47.782 --> 00:23:49.283
Authoritarian Media Theory.

00:23:49.367 --> 00:23:50.660
Yes, sir.

00:23:52.161 --> 00:23:54.914
It's over, you prick.
Have the candy and go home.

00:23:57.583 --> 00:23:59.794
Thank you.

00:24:02.421 --> 00:24:04.840
Oh, you're actually loyal.
You're pressuring us.

00:24:04.924 --> 00:24:06.884
Oh, drinking friends?
That's hard to resist.

00:24:06.968 --> 00:24:07.927
Are you down for a drink?

00:24:08.719 --> 00:24:10.346
- What? No.
- Then why are you here?

00:24:10.930 --> 00:24:11.764
Well…

00:24:13.057 --> 00:24:13.975
To become friends.

00:24:14.058 --> 00:24:15.685
Shit, that's so much pressure.

00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:18.896
What if your name were Wi-do?

00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:20.314
Kyeong-do is better.

00:24:25.361 --> 00:24:27.905
Why bother me smoking
when you've got nothing to do here?

00:24:27.989 --> 00:24:29.699
I'm okay. Feel free to smoke.

00:24:29.782 --> 00:24:33.828
How can I feel free?
Why don't you stop your fake cough?

00:24:35.705 --> 00:24:39.500
Well… Where are the other members?

00:24:39.583 --> 00:24:41.544
The three of us will do.

00:24:41.627 --> 00:24:42.503
Sorry?

00:24:42.586 --> 00:24:45.131
We got to secure
the club room again this year.

00:24:45.214 --> 00:24:48.134
We finally have a newbie.

00:24:48.217 --> 00:24:50.720
If one door closes,
another door opens, right?

00:24:50.803 --> 00:24:53.806
When we were just about to get kicked out,
we got a newbie.

00:24:53.889 --> 00:24:56.392
- Who brought him in?
- Right.

00:24:56.475 --> 00:25:01.647
So are you saying if I withdraw,
you're at risk of closing or something?

00:25:01.731 --> 00:25:03.524
Don't ask. It breaks my heart.

00:25:06.902 --> 00:25:09.030
Hey, this is awesome.
We'll get to put on a play.

00:25:09.113 --> 00:25:12.074
Hey, stamp the application form now.

00:25:12.158 --> 00:25:13.284
Stamp with your thumbprint.

00:25:13.367 --> 00:25:14.994
You were good at acting earlier.

00:25:18.831 --> 00:25:21.083
CURRENT AFFAIRS

00:25:35.431 --> 00:25:37.558
YOU'VE GOT A CALL
MOM

00:25:47.276 --> 00:25:48.527
Hello?

00:25:48.611 --> 00:25:50.821
Ji-woo, what have you been up to lately?

00:25:51.947 --> 00:25:55.284
Well, I'm out to meet a friend.

00:25:55.368 --> 00:25:58.329
This is why I told you
to stay in New York.

00:25:58.412 --> 00:26:00.998
Did you come back to waste your time?

00:26:04.335 --> 00:26:07.671
If you're going to take care of yourself,
do it properly.

00:26:08.589 --> 00:26:09.590
I'm hanging up.

00:28:41.450 --> 00:28:42.409
What are you doing here?

00:28:45.496 --> 00:28:47.623
What are you doing? It's dark.

00:28:49.291 --> 00:28:50.626
I'm listening to music.

00:28:52.419 --> 00:28:53.254
Aren't you going home?

00:28:55.005 --> 00:28:55.839
I will.

00:28:58.092 --> 00:28:58.926
Get up.

00:29:00.761 --> 00:29:01.595
Go first.

00:29:04.848 --> 00:29:07.851
Thought you were tough. What happened?
You sorry for breaking your promise?

00:29:10.854 --> 00:29:11.772
Did you wait for me?

00:29:14.024 --> 00:29:15.859
Am I crazy? Why would I wait for you?

00:29:15.943 --> 00:29:17.528
Then how do you know I didn't show up?

00:29:20.239 --> 00:29:21.240
Well…

00:29:22.741 --> 00:29:26.662
I had a club meeting. I had to be there.

00:29:27.329 --> 00:29:28.163
Got it?

00:29:40.634 --> 00:29:41.468
What?

00:29:42.052 --> 00:29:44.555
Do you want to listen to what I like?

00:29:47.433 --> 00:29:49.977
Whatever.
If you're not going, I'll go first.

00:29:50.060 --> 00:29:50.894
Okay.

00:29:57.735 --> 00:29:58.736
Gosh.

00:30:01.739 --> 00:30:02.990
It's dark here.

00:30:03.741 --> 00:30:06.493
The last bus will leave soon.
There'll be no one around.

00:30:07.161 --> 00:30:07.995
So?

00:30:08.078 --> 00:30:09.246
Get up. It's dangerous.

00:30:10.247 --> 00:30:11.248
Are you worried about me?

00:30:11.332 --> 00:30:13.000
Are you emotionally deprived?

00:30:13.083 --> 00:30:14.877
Why do you keep
giving meaning to everything?

00:30:38.859 --> 00:30:41.278
Wait, I mean, I…

00:30:43.030 --> 00:30:44.406
Well, I was just…

00:30:46.158 --> 00:30:47.409
Isn't my acting good?

00:30:48.410 --> 00:30:50.871
- Aren't I perfect for the acting club?
- Jeez…

00:30:54.124 --> 00:30:57.503
Oh, get a grip. Just get up.
The bus will leave soon.

00:31:00.923 --> 00:31:02.257
I'm good at swearing, right?

00:31:02.341 --> 00:31:03.509
Don't be proud of it.

00:31:03.592 --> 00:31:04.843
Don't I look strong?

00:31:04.927 --> 00:31:06.345
You look dumb.

00:31:06.845 --> 00:31:10.849
I only practiced it to look strong.
You're so fucking annoying.

00:31:10.933 --> 00:31:13.102
"So fucking" is all you can say.

00:31:14.144 --> 00:31:15.562
I mean, do you want to look strong?

00:31:16.063 --> 00:31:16.897
Yes.

00:31:17.648 --> 00:31:19.650
What for with that pretty-ish face?

00:31:28.867 --> 00:31:30.285
Did you just ask me out?

00:31:31.078 --> 00:31:31.912
What?

00:31:33.163 --> 00:31:34.915
You just asked me out.

00:31:36.625 --> 00:31:38.085
I… I did?

00:31:40.129 --> 00:31:41.296
How?

00:31:41.380 --> 00:31:42.631
You just called me pretty.

00:31:46.552 --> 00:31:50.472
I said you had a pretty-ish face.
I didn't exactly say pretty.

00:31:50.556 --> 00:31:52.307
I was only encouraging you
to stop swearing.

00:31:53.559 --> 00:31:55.978
If you say things like that
without meaning them,

00:31:56.061 --> 00:31:56.895
you're a real bastard.

00:32:03.110 --> 00:32:03.944
Wait up.

00:32:04.027 --> 00:32:06.530
If I miss the bus,
I'd be sleeping out for two days in a row.

00:32:10.242 --> 00:32:12.369
Oh, hurry up. There's no time for texting.

00:32:12.453 --> 00:32:13.829
Okay, okay.

00:32:19.668 --> 00:32:21.170
- Let's run.
- What?

00:33:16.141 --> 00:33:18.519
What were you listening to earlier?

00:33:34.910 --> 00:33:36.078
SUNG SI-KYUNG

00:33:36.161 --> 00:33:37.371
TWO PEOPLE

00:33:39.122 --> 00:33:42.751
After a long day

00:33:43.377 --> 00:33:46.547
Under the moonlight, two people

00:33:47.464 --> 00:33:49.883
Become one shadow

00:33:50.801 --> 00:33:52.803
If I close my eyes

00:33:53.554 --> 00:33:58.141
Faint happiness that I could catch

00:33:58.225 --> 00:34:03.063
Is still there

00:34:06.108 --> 00:34:09.736
A broken heart

00:34:10.445 --> 00:34:12.781
May cast a shadow

00:34:13.448 --> 00:34:17.077
Over your dream

00:34:17.578 --> 00:34:19.788
But remember

00:34:20.455 --> 00:34:26.545
That someone who loves you until it hurts

00:34:27.212 --> 00:34:30.549
Is still next to you

00:34:31.383 --> 00:34:35.512
Although this road

00:34:35.596 --> 00:34:38.348
Seems too far

00:34:39.266 --> 00:34:44.980
Although the sad heart makes you cry

00:34:45.898 --> 00:34:51.653
Until everything becomes a memory

00:34:52.404 --> 00:34:53.739
The two of us…

00:34:54.489 --> 00:34:56.867
- Are you taking the subway?
- What about you?

00:34:58.243 --> 00:34:59.411
I'm taking another bus.

00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:03.874
Bye.

00:35:06.335 --> 00:35:07.169
Bye.

00:35:11.256 --> 00:35:12.716
Do you have a cell phone?

00:35:14.176 --> 00:35:15.177
Why?

00:35:15.677 --> 00:35:17.220
Your cell phone…

00:35:23.101 --> 00:35:24.311
Give me your number.

00:35:41.620 --> 00:35:42.454
Give me your phone.

00:36:12.109 --> 00:36:15.612
You don't look old. You look young.

00:37:14.796 --> 00:37:15.630
Shit.

00:37:20.844 --> 00:37:22.179
INCOMING CALL
SE-YEONG

00:37:31.772 --> 00:37:32.606
Hey, Se-yeong.

00:37:32.689 --> 00:37:35.442
- Hi, Kyeong-do. Where are you?
- Oh, I'm home.

00:37:36.318 --> 00:37:37.402
What are you doing?

00:37:37.486 --> 00:37:38.487
I'm just chilling.

00:37:38.570 --> 00:37:40.447
Right, you should get some rest.

00:37:40.530 --> 00:37:41.531
Did you get home safely?

00:37:41.615 --> 00:37:42.699
Yes, sure.

00:37:43.617 --> 00:37:48.038
You see, Ji-woo wants to talk to you.

00:37:48.121 --> 00:37:49.331
No, never.

00:37:51.666 --> 00:37:56.171
I mean, what's there to talk about?
It's not like I published that article.

00:37:56.254 --> 00:38:00.342
I barely remember her face.
It has nothing to do with me.

00:38:00.425 --> 00:38:03.053
I know. Yeah, you have a point, but…

00:38:03.136 --> 00:38:04.638
Shit, I knew it.

00:38:04.721 --> 00:38:07.224
I should've sent it
to the Current Affairs Team. Damn it.

00:38:10.602 --> 00:38:13.355
Anyway, Se-yeong, that can't be done.

00:38:13.855 --> 00:38:16.483
You also think that's wrong, right?

00:38:17.943 --> 00:38:20.403
Yeah, I'm sorry,
but take care of it for me.

00:38:20.487 --> 00:38:21.988
Yeah. Bye.

00:38:25.534 --> 00:38:28.286
No, not me. What did I do wrong?

00:38:28.787 --> 00:38:31.289
I did nothing. No!

00:38:32.833 --> 00:38:33.667
Shit…

00:38:43.885 --> 00:38:45.220
Hello, Dongwoon Daily Entertainment.

00:38:47.430 --> 00:38:49.850
That's not our department.

00:38:50.350 --> 00:38:53.270
I'm not sure. Maybe Current Affairs?

00:38:53.353 --> 00:38:55.647
Yes, I'll connect you
to the person in charge.

00:39:01.027 --> 00:39:03.029
Assistant Manager,
when did you go out with Seo Ji-woo?

00:39:06.491 --> 00:39:09.244
What if she comes to see you?
How many years has it been?

00:39:09.327 --> 00:39:10.162
Hey.

00:39:10.245 --> 00:39:13.165
Well, I've heard that she visited you
when you were a newbie reporter.

00:39:16.585 --> 00:39:17.419
Hey.

00:39:21.089 --> 00:39:22.716
Hello, Dongwoon Daily Entertainment.

00:39:23.216 --> 00:39:24.050
Yes.

00:39:26.094 --> 00:39:27.721
Lee Kyeong-do?

00:39:29.139 --> 00:39:31.433
Well, why are you looking for him?

00:39:32.058 --> 00:39:34.186
Oh, you're his acquaintance…

00:39:35.187 --> 00:39:37.230
But he's not available.

00:39:38.273 --> 00:39:39.858
Business trip. Say I'm on a business trip.

00:39:39.941 --> 00:39:41.776
He's on a business trip.

00:39:41.860 --> 00:39:44.070
I'll let him know when he returns.
What's your name?

00:39:50.368 --> 00:39:51.369
Jeez.

00:39:51.453 --> 00:39:52.704
It was a woman.

00:39:53.288 --> 00:39:54.456
Will you shut up?

00:39:56.416 --> 00:39:59.711
It was exactly the voice
of a woman of Seo Ji-woo's age.

00:39:59.794 --> 00:40:01.213
Will you go back to your seat?

00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:04.049
- Okay.
- Damn you.

00:40:10.263 --> 00:40:11.431
Gosh, so annoying.

00:40:23.109 --> 00:40:25.570
OVER A THOUSAND RI AWAY,
I WILL DIE AND YOU LIVE

00:40:30.116 --> 00:40:36.665
BOOK CONCERT FOR THE PUBLICATION
OF CHUSA'S LETTERS WITH THE AUTHOR

00:40:42.545 --> 00:40:44.089
You call this a concert?

00:40:44.172 --> 00:40:45.882
It is. It's a book concert.

00:40:48.426 --> 00:40:49.427
What?

00:40:52.222 --> 00:40:54.557
It's not too late now. Let's go.

00:40:54.641 --> 00:40:56.309
Oh, it's starting. It's starting.

00:41:04.025 --> 00:41:09.364
When Chusa was seven, he wrote
a New Year's banner to hang on his gate.

00:41:09.948 --> 00:41:12.325
And Beonam Chae Je-gong,
who was passing by,

00:41:12.409 --> 00:41:15.578
saw his writing and said,
"What an excellent writing."

00:41:15.662 --> 00:41:18.999
As you can see, Chusa had
an outstanding talent since he was little

00:41:19.082 --> 00:41:20.917
and was renowned for his calligraphy.

00:41:21.001 --> 00:41:23.753
He also left many poems.

00:41:24.587 --> 00:41:28.925
Oh, if you know
any of Chusa Kim Jeong-hui's poems,

00:41:29.009 --> 00:41:31.636
please raise your hand.

00:41:37.517 --> 00:41:38.810
- Yes.
- Domangsi.

00:41:38.893 --> 00:41:41.646
Domangsi by Chusa. Bravo!

00:41:42.689 --> 00:41:44.524
- Come on up.
- Go there?

00:41:44.607 --> 00:41:47.986
Come here. You deserve a gift certificate.

00:41:48.069 --> 00:41:49.154
Oh, yes.

00:41:51.114 --> 00:41:53.908
Domangsi is also my favorite poem.

00:41:54.492 --> 00:41:57.329
I actually proposed to my wife with it.

00:41:58.371 --> 00:41:59.706
Thank you.

00:42:10.759 --> 00:42:11.718
Do you like books?

00:42:13.011 --> 00:42:14.220
No.

00:42:14.304 --> 00:42:16.431
You looked like a Korean literature major.

00:42:20.435 --> 00:42:22.645
I only like Chusa.

00:42:25.648 --> 00:42:26.983
That poem.

00:42:27.525 --> 00:42:29.611
- Was it Domangsi?
- Yes.

00:42:30.195 --> 00:42:31.154
Did you memorize it?

00:42:31.946 --> 00:42:32.781
Yes.

00:42:33.948 --> 00:42:35.200
- Recite it.
- What?

00:42:39.454 --> 00:42:40.914
- Here?
- Yes.

00:42:41.998 --> 00:42:44.918
I'm curious. The title sounds funny.

00:42:45.919 --> 00:42:47.045
What kind of name is Domangsi?

00:42:49.839 --> 00:42:51.174
That's what I thought too.

00:42:52.300 --> 00:42:53.802
I thought the title was funny.

00:42:53.885 --> 00:42:58.306
But "domang" doesn't mean to run away.

00:42:59.891 --> 00:43:03.228
Chusa loved his wife so much,

00:43:04.104 --> 00:43:06.773
but she died first.

00:43:08.149 --> 00:43:10.402
That's when he wrote this poem.

00:43:21.037 --> 00:43:24.457
"Only if one could entreat Elder Wolha

00:43:25.375 --> 00:43:29.003
that we be born
with fates exchanged in the next life."

00:43:30.380 --> 00:43:34.384
"Over a thousand ri away,
I will die and you live."

00:43:36.136 --> 00:43:40.557
"Then you shall know
the depth of my sorrow."

00:44:02.704 --> 00:44:03.538
Wait.

00:44:05.290 --> 00:44:06.791
Are you crying?

00:44:08.334 --> 00:44:09.169
But why…

00:44:10.753 --> 00:44:12.338
It's so sad.

00:44:13.673 --> 00:44:14.507
What?

00:44:21.222 --> 00:44:24.350
Hey, he must have missed his wife so much
to write such a poem.

00:44:33.234 --> 00:44:34.319
I know.

00:44:47.665 --> 00:44:49.292
Hey, by the way,

00:44:49.834 --> 00:44:54.589
I guess you're not that much of a maniac.

00:44:58.635 --> 00:44:59.844
Hey…

00:45:02.138 --> 00:45:03.598
You're so annoying.

00:46:57.879 --> 00:47:01.174
You scare me when you smile.
Just cry or eat me up.

00:47:01.257 --> 00:47:02.884
Don't you have pride?

00:47:03.468 --> 00:47:05.178
- You never change.
- What do you mean?

00:47:05.970 --> 00:47:07.972
How can you be wearing my brand?

00:47:13.645 --> 00:47:16.064
I got this so you'd thrive.
Is that a problem?

00:47:16.147 --> 00:47:18.399
I'm thriving even without your purchases.

00:47:18.483 --> 00:47:19.609
Sure.

00:47:25.114 --> 00:47:26.324
Well…

00:47:26.908 --> 00:47:29.327
What was that? The article--

00:47:29.410 --> 00:47:32.330
I disappeared ten years ago
and finally showed up now.

00:47:32.997 --> 00:47:35.249
Why would you want
to talk about the article?

00:47:36.501 --> 00:47:39.837
I can see that you haven't been well.
How's your health?

00:47:39.921 --> 00:47:43.257
Still the same. I'm exhausted
from all the psychiatric medication.

00:47:47.011 --> 00:47:48.930
You still make me speechless.

00:47:53.518 --> 00:47:54.352
Is it good?

00:47:54.435 --> 00:47:56.854
I drink it 'cause it's awkward,
not 'cause it's good.

00:47:56.938 --> 00:48:00.316
Or maybe because you're nervous?
Why don't you have a beer instead?

00:48:07.532 --> 00:48:08.491
Ji-woo.

00:48:09.742 --> 00:48:11.828
- Just say it.
- Are you sure?

00:48:13.538 --> 00:48:15.707
- Want me to say what I want?
- Yeah, do it.

00:48:25.550 --> 00:48:27.719
Godot never comes even if you wait,

00:48:28.928 --> 00:48:30.388
but you'll come, won't you?

00:48:35.643 --> 00:48:39.021
I've waited to see if you'd really come.

00:48:58.791 --> 00:49:02.795
We're members of society now, right?

00:49:04.797 --> 00:49:08.551
Why would you bring up a mere play
we did when we were 20?

00:49:11.345 --> 00:49:13.097
A mere play?

00:49:24.150 --> 00:49:25.485
Coward.

00:49:38.080 --> 00:49:40.124
WAITING FOR GODOT

00:49:43.669 --> 00:49:45.671
The name of the play is Waiting for Godot?

00:49:45.755 --> 00:49:47.131
Yes.

00:49:47.840 --> 00:49:49.175
Do you like plays?

00:49:50.134 --> 00:49:52.220
I'm not sure yet.

00:49:53.012 --> 00:49:54.764
Then why did you join the acting club?

00:49:56.015 --> 00:49:58.100
- You're too pathetic to walk away from.
- You scared me.

00:49:58.184 --> 00:49:59.685
Your arm is shaking so much.

00:50:00.186 --> 00:50:01.187
Hey, hey.

00:50:04.315 --> 00:50:06.317
You're the poop girl, right?

00:50:06.400 --> 00:50:08.444
Poop? Did you poop somewhere again?

00:50:08.528 --> 00:50:11.405
It's a misunderstanding.
Restrooms aren't just for pooping.

00:50:11.489 --> 00:50:14.659
I know, but you said your stomach hurt,

00:50:14.742 --> 00:50:17.286
and if you pooped there,
I wouldn't be able to get away with it,

00:50:17.370 --> 00:50:18.204
and you ran away.

00:50:18.287 --> 00:50:21.582
That's poop. That was definitely poop.
You really pooped. You always poop…

00:50:21.666 --> 00:50:22.542
Hey.

00:50:22.625 --> 00:50:25.711
Hold on. Are you the one
who got Lee Kyeong-do to join the club…

00:50:25.795 --> 00:50:26.921
Yes, that's me.

00:50:30.633 --> 00:50:33.553
Kyeong-do, you two argued nonstop,
and now you're dating?

00:50:33.636 --> 00:50:34.846
Yes.

00:50:34.929 --> 00:50:38.099
Too busy dating to come to the club room?
Have you memorized the script?

00:50:38.182 --> 00:50:39.559
Are you performing? The lead role?

00:50:40.643 --> 00:50:42.270
He doesn't have the lead role's face.

00:50:42.353 --> 00:50:44.564
Whatever. Let's go.
The drink is getting cold.

00:50:44.647 --> 00:50:46.065
Why would the drink get cold?

00:50:47.275 --> 00:50:48.901
- Are you off to drink?
- Yes.

00:50:48.985 --> 00:50:50.528
- Oh, no.
- Why not?

00:50:50.611 --> 00:50:52.238
- Want to join us?
- Her eyes have gone crazy.

00:50:52.321 --> 00:50:55.074
- Why are you getting excited about this?
- Let's go!

00:50:55.157 --> 00:50:56.158
No!

00:50:56.242 --> 00:50:57.618
- Cheers!
- Cheers.

00:51:00.037 --> 00:51:01.247
MOM

00:51:04.625 --> 00:51:05.543
Kyeong-do.

00:51:05.626 --> 00:51:06.544
He's over there.

00:51:06.627 --> 00:51:08.296
Kyeong-do!

00:51:08.880 --> 00:51:09.714
Yes?

00:51:10.464 --> 00:51:13.676
Speak casually.
Honorifics? That's all hypocritical.

00:51:13.759 --> 00:51:16.721
There you go again.
You're the biggest hypocrite.

00:51:16.804 --> 00:51:18.723
Se-yeong, what's your major?

00:51:18.806 --> 00:51:22.894
Fine arts. But it's all hypocritical.

00:51:22.977 --> 00:51:25.688
Art? Shit, tell it to fuck off.

00:51:25.771 --> 00:51:29.275
Cover your ears. She swears
every time she opens her mouth.

00:51:29.358 --> 00:51:32.695
Se-yeong, you're so good at swearing.
You should teach me.

00:51:32.778 --> 00:51:34.280
Kyeong-do, you should break up.

00:51:34.363 --> 00:51:35.406
She has a kind heart.

00:51:35.489 --> 00:51:38.910
Have you seen it?
Gosh, have you opened her up?

00:51:38.993 --> 00:51:40.953
You can see it without opening it up.

00:51:41.996 --> 00:51:44.081
This prick is a damn hypocrite too.

00:51:44.165 --> 00:51:46.751
How can you see it?
That's the poop talking.

00:51:46.834 --> 00:51:49.921
- See? Your life is all about poop.
- Seriously! I…

00:51:50.004 --> 00:51:52.632
If you're poop, I'm fucked up. I really…

00:51:52.715 --> 00:51:54.008
Oh, not again…

00:51:54.091 --> 00:51:55.217
MOM

00:51:55.968 --> 00:51:58.471
- Don't you have to go? Let's go.
- It's okay. I'm fine.

00:51:58.554 --> 00:52:00.765
What? Where do you think you're going?
We've only started.

00:52:00.848 --> 00:52:02.183
I think Ji-woo has to go.

00:52:03.184 --> 00:52:04.977
Oh, aren't you all going home?

00:52:05.061 --> 00:52:06.187
We all live on our own.

00:52:06.270 --> 00:52:08.606
You do? I want to be independent too.

00:52:08.689 --> 00:52:09.649
No, you can't. No, no.

00:52:09.732 --> 00:52:11.359
Oh, no. You'll end up like her. Okay?

00:52:11.442 --> 00:52:13.194
What do you mean, you prick?

00:52:13.277 --> 00:52:16.489
No, sorry. My neck hurts.
Come down. No! Don't! Stop it!

00:52:16.572 --> 00:52:21.327
Will you stop fighting for goodness' sake?
Oh, stop it, please.

00:52:21.410 --> 00:52:22.620
Hello?

00:52:23.829 --> 00:52:27.458
Is this why you took a leave of absence?
As soon as you enrolled?

00:52:28.250 --> 00:52:32.254
Mom, I don't want
to go back to that school.

00:52:32.338 --> 00:52:34.548
Ji-woo, please!

00:52:34.632 --> 00:52:36.467
I can't get anything into my head.

00:52:37.802 --> 00:52:40.179
And I'm not interested
in Western art history at all.

00:52:42.014 --> 00:52:44.016
You don't study because you like it.

00:52:44.517 --> 00:52:47.353
You need a BA to get somewhere.
A proper degree.

00:52:47.436 --> 00:52:51.857
So I'll go to a university here.

00:52:53.484 --> 00:52:55.486
I'll prepare
for the college entrance exam.

00:52:56.445 --> 00:52:57.363
Please?

00:53:00.741 --> 00:53:02.910
Why can't you live with some pride?

00:53:04.328 --> 00:53:05.830
What do you lack?

00:53:06.497 --> 00:53:07.999
I got you everything you wanted,

00:53:08.082 --> 00:53:10.001
but you can't stop taking
the depression medication.

00:53:10.084 --> 00:53:11.002
Why…

00:53:14.046 --> 00:53:16.507
Why is your life such a mess?

00:53:20.928 --> 00:53:25.016
Read the room, please, Ji-woo.

00:54:58.234 --> 00:54:59.610
Oh, my phone.

00:55:45.030 --> 00:55:47.575
What's wrong? What happened?

00:55:49.285 --> 00:55:53.664
I'm pathetic, aren't I?
For coming here with nothing…

00:55:56.500 --> 00:55:58.210
I'm pathetic, aren't I, Kyeong-do?

00:55:58.794 --> 00:56:00.129
No. Why would you be?

00:56:01.380 --> 00:56:04.925
I'm happy that you came to see me.

00:56:19.732 --> 00:56:21.275
I like you.

00:56:37.666 --> 00:56:38.876
Ji-woo.

00:56:39.710 --> 00:56:45.007
Do you know why I joined the acting club?

00:56:53.140 --> 00:56:54.308
Because…

00:56:56.810 --> 00:56:58.646
you were sitting at that table.

00:57:14.495 --> 00:57:18.999
I actually joined the club
without knowing what it was for.

00:57:22.294 --> 00:57:23.462
Because you were there.

00:58:45.169 --> 00:58:46.211
I'm going to England.

00:58:47.671 --> 00:58:51.383
Thanks to you, I'm free now.
Thank you for the article.

00:58:54.261 --> 00:58:55.471
Just punch me, will you?

00:58:56.764 --> 00:59:00.184
You still don't trust people.
Back then or even now.

00:59:01.560 --> 00:59:04.897
I'm really thankful to you.
I got a divorce thanks to your article.

00:59:05.814 --> 00:59:07.483
Thank you from the bottom of my heart.

00:59:22.998 --> 00:59:24.750
He's claiming
I was at fault for everything.

00:59:26.210 --> 00:59:28.962
Although I was at a disadvantage
from the start…

00:59:29.046 --> 00:59:31.840
What do you mean?
What are you talking about?

00:59:31.924 --> 00:59:35.594
My marriage was more like…
Should I say M&A?

00:59:36.387 --> 00:59:40.599
But I was the unfavorable one
since my youth was pretty turbulent.

00:59:41.475 --> 00:59:43.977
They said I should be grateful
that they'd accepted me.

00:59:45.437 --> 00:59:48.774
My depression and panic disorders
were also my fault.

00:59:48.857 --> 00:59:51.735
Being unable to get pregnant
was also my fault.

00:59:52.403 --> 00:59:54.613
I even heard about the rumor
that says I'm sterile.

01:00:01.078 --> 01:00:02.996
We weren't in love anyway.

01:00:03.080 --> 01:00:07.167
That asshole having an affair
wasn't shocking at all. But still…

01:00:10.963 --> 01:00:12.464
I felt miserable.

01:00:13.507 --> 01:00:15.008
Because he didn't even try to hide it.

01:00:16.260 --> 01:00:17.678
Sometimes when he got drunk,

01:00:18.887 --> 01:00:20.013
he swore at me.

01:00:20.597 --> 01:00:22.891
Oh, that fucking son of a bitch.

01:00:26.103 --> 01:00:29.815
Don't be like that.
You're melting my heart.

01:00:30.816 --> 01:00:32.651
I can't fall for you again. Don't do that.

01:00:32.734 --> 01:00:34.278
Will you get a grip?

01:00:35.237 --> 01:00:37.322
How can you say that
in a situation like this?

01:00:37.406 --> 01:00:39.158
That doesn't make you look strong at all.

01:00:45.539 --> 01:00:48.041
I've been filing for a divorce nonstop.

01:00:48.125 --> 01:00:50.544
And I finally got to end it this time.

01:00:52.379 --> 01:00:54.673
Thank you so much. I mean it.

01:01:01.180 --> 01:01:02.097
Okay.

01:01:03.432 --> 01:01:06.435
If you say that, that's good.

01:01:08.228 --> 01:01:09.980
- Bye then.
- Sit down.

01:01:10.063 --> 01:01:12.065
What? Do you have anything else to say?

01:01:14.651 --> 01:01:18.572
I don't know if this is exclusive enough,
but one more scoop so we're even.

01:01:18.655 --> 01:01:19.656
No, thanks.

01:01:19.740 --> 01:01:21.783
Oh, why do you have to fucking act up?

01:01:21.867 --> 01:01:23.660
Why are you fucking acting up?

01:01:32.085 --> 01:01:33.212
Write about my divorce.

01:01:34.630 --> 01:01:36.298
I'll give it to you exclusively.

01:01:36.381 --> 01:01:38.300
I want to look cool,

01:01:38.800 --> 01:01:41.470
so make sure to say I've been filing
for a divorce for a long time.

01:01:58.570 --> 01:01:59.404
Ji-woo.

01:02:01.448 --> 01:02:04.660
When I had to confirm the article
about your hubby, I couldn't fall asleep.

01:02:06.119 --> 01:02:06.995
Were you worried?

01:02:07.079 --> 01:02:09.748
Yes, about seeing you face-to-face
and listening to your gibberish.

01:02:10.332 --> 01:02:12.084
- Gibberish?
- Yes, gibberish.

01:02:12.167 --> 01:02:14.545
Crazy gibberish, you cruel asshole!

01:02:24.388 --> 01:02:25.764
See you at the funeral.

01:02:27.599 --> 01:02:29.059
Whether you die or I die.

01:04:25.842 --> 01:04:28.428
Is there anyone who can't make it
to the group blind date?

01:04:28.512 --> 01:04:29.513
Raise your hand.

01:04:30.639 --> 01:04:32.432
Why aren't you raising your hand?

01:04:33.684 --> 01:04:34.851
Right.

01:04:35.435 --> 01:04:38.438
You handsome ass must come.
Anyone else who can't come?

01:04:40.357 --> 01:04:41.983
Oh, but I'm not…

01:05:03.213 --> 01:05:05.632
Kyeong-do, it's this Saturday at 3 p.m.

01:05:09.136 --> 01:05:09.970
I can't go.

01:05:10.053 --> 01:05:12.097
You wanna end your school life, handsome?

01:05:13.890 --> 01:05:17.394
I can't go because I look old.
I'd only ruin our major's impression.

01:05:17.477 --> 01:05:19.146
I look too old. Sorry.

01:05:19.229 --> 01:05:22.149
Hey, if you look old… Kyeong-do!

01:05:24.151 --> 01:05:27.571
SURELY TOMORROW

01:05:27.654 --> 01:05:28.947
{\an8}- No way.
- Talk to each other.

01:05:29.030 --> 01:05:30.657
{\an8}- I'm not doing it.
- Don't do it.

01:05:30.741 --> 01:05:32.409
{\an8}- Work things out!
- Let's do it.

01:05:32.492 --> 01:05:34.703
{\an8}Kyeong-do's information
has all been released.

01:05:34.786 --> 01:05:35.620
{\an8}Seo Ji-woo!

01:05:35.704 --> 01:05:38.623
{\an8}The Assistant Manager idiot
provided articles for other media.

01:05:38.707 --> 01:05:40.959
{\an8}What do you think
of this ridiculous situation?

01:05:41.626 --> 01:05:44.212
{\an8}I was young, immature, and vulnerable.

01:05:45.547 --> 01:05:47.883
{\an8}I was innocent and sincere.

01:05:47.966 --> 01:05:51.511
{\an8}It was an 18-year friendship.
So don't make it look like it was love?

01:05:52.846 --> 01:05:55.599
{\an8}You got dragged into my mess
and almost had your life messed up again.

01:05:56.141 --> 01:05:58.685
{\an8}You're wrong. You got two things wrong.

01:05:59.644 --> 01:06:01.062
{\an8}I never got dragged into it.

01:06:02.647 --> 01:06:04.274
{\an8}And my life
had never been messed up before.
