00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:59.439
Miss,

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:00.680
your rhythm is off.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.000
Come down, I’ll show you.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:02.640
It’s not right?

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:03.280
No, it’s not.

00:02:03.519 --> 00:02:04.079
Come.

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:05.200
Huzi, be good, come here.

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.079
Let’s show big sis how it’s done.

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.319
Let’s race her, okay?

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:13.319
Thirteen.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.240
Fourteen.

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:17.400
Fifteen.

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:19.599
Sixteen.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.759
This one.

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:23.080
Nineteen.

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.680
Twenty.

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.919
Miss,

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.680
it’s fine.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:34.639
You keep working out.

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:36.199
I’ll practice my Iron Head Skill.

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:42.240
Then you…

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:44.360
just be careful.

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:45.520
No problem.

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.680
Miss,

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:57.680
that machine’s not used like that.

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.520
Move.

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.759
Let your master show you.

00:03:04.719 --> 00:03:05.319
Like this.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.719
Now it’s straight.

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:09.159
This is the front.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.360
Side.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:14.120
Left, right.

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:16.919
Here,

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.439
give it a try.

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:19.319
I– I’ll do it.

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:20.280
I can’t do it.

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:21.479
This is just… way too hard.

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.919
Okay.

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:23.520
You’re getting a bit hunched.

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:24.159
Hurry and train that.

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:26.759
Stand tall, that’s great.

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:35.919
Put some strength in it.

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:41.719
Come on.

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.520
You got this.

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:44.280
Lift your legs higher.

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.879
Keep going.

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.639
Keep going.

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:47.280
Keep going.

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.639
Keep—

00:03:47.719 --> 00:03:48.080
Keep going.

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:48.960
Keep going.

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.520
Keep going.

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:50.319
Keep going.

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:00.479
Your legs don’t hurt, right?

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:02.479
Nothing serious.

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:04.479
Why’d you go to that square anyway?

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.120
I was just thinking,

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.360
the wedding’s coming up,

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.639
so I’m training, shaping up.

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:12.639
Still, that’s not your kind of place.

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:14.879
That’s for grannies and grandpas,

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:16.439
their info exchange hub.

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:18.040
What do you mean?

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:19.439
They work out on one side

00:04:19.439 --> 00:04:20.680
and gossip on the other.

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:22.279
Culture and sport, two-in-one.

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.319
How was I supposed to know?

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:30.319
See?

00:04:32.959 --> 00:04:33.839
What did I tell you?

00:04:35.439 --> 00:04:37.160
Don't train in those wild areas.

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:38.639
Then I...

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:39.240
Got hurt, didn't you?

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:40.319
Does it hurt?

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:42.000
No.

00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:43.480
Learn your lesson.

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:44.879
Next time...

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:47.360
Train here.

00:04:49.879 --> 00:04:50.759
The gym?

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:52.279
No need.

00:04:52.319 --> 00:04:54.199
I can just jog by the roadside.

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:55.319
Roadside is even more dangerous.

00:04:55.319 --> 00:04:56.079
Just go here.

00:04:56.079 --> 00:04:56.480
Take it.

00:04:57.319 --> 00:04:58.399
Let me show you their place.

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:01.639
Who wants to own such a...

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:02.600
LEGO castle?

00:05:02.879 --> 00:05:04.000
Yes yes, not this one, not this.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.560
I told a story about a LEGO minifigure's...

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:07.439
Entire life from birth to death.

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:07.920
Not this one either.

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:08.920
2024 domestic...

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:10.920
You watch short videos all day...

00:05:11.079 --> 00:05:12.759
Just looking at these plastic figures?

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:15.759
Indulge occasionally.

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:17.000
Just watch this video.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:17.839
Watch this video.

00:05:18.079 --> 00:05:19.360
Kangle Private Gym.

00:05:19.519 --> 00:05:20.519
One-on-one personal training.

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:21.839
Full member services.

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:23.680
Welcome to join us.

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:24.360
Pretty good, right?

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.199
This must be quite expensive.

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:28.959
Money is meant to be spent.

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:30.920
As long as it's spent on you...

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:31.720
I think it's...

00:05:31.839 --> 00:05:32.279
Worth it.

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:33.560
Alright.

00:05:34.079 --> 00:05:34.600
Don't worry.

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:35.879
I'll definitely go every day.

00:05:36.399 --> 00:05:38.160
Won't let your money go to waste.

00:05:38.959 --> 00:05:39.399
Keep it up.

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:40.600
You can do it.

00:05:40.959 --> 00:05:41.959
With this card...

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:43.879
I've already made a plan.

00:05:44.519 --> 00:05:46.079
First month: lose 15 jin.

00:05:46.079 --> 00:05:46.439
Good.

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:48.079
Second month: lose 30 jin.

00:05:48.079 --> 00:05:48.519
Great!

00:05:48.519 --> 00:05:49.279
Third month...

00:05:49.279 --> 00:05:50.319
Even the box weighs 10 jin.

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:51.519
Keep fooling around.

00:05:52.879 --> 00:05:53.839
Just keep eating.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:55.680
Um...

00:05:55.839 --> 00:05:57.399
I'll get you a pen.

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:58.519
Make your plan.

00:06:09.399 --> 00:06:10.319
Big circle.

00:06:10.439 --> 00:06:10.959
Right.

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:12.000
Big circle.

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:15.360
Yes.

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:19.560
Lift it, lift it, lift it!

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:21.319
Sis.

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:23.480
Want to take a photo?

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.040
Post it on social media?

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:25.920
Sure.

00:06:26.319 --> 00:06:27.319
I need to show Meng Hang.

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:28.680
Okay.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:34.319
Sis.

00:06:34.439 --> 00:06:35.199
Wait a moment.

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:39.439
This isn't necessary.

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:41.000
It's fine, it's proper.

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:42.439
So professional.

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:43.759
Sis, don't worry.

00:06:43.839 --> 00:06:45.120
I'm this gym's...

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:46.600
Coach with highest photo success rate.

00:07:07.399 --> 00:07:08.759
Not... not ready yet.

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:10.879
Need perfection.

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:12.199
It's fine.

00:07:12.199 --> 00:07:13.519
Maybe... speed up a little?

00:07:13.519 --> 00:07:15.040
Half an hour just adjusting lights.

00:07:15.079 --> 00:07:15.680
True.

00:07:15.959 --> 00:07:17.399
Adjusting lights is troublesome.

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:23.120
Sis

00:07:23.199 --> 00:07:23.879
I see you

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:25.240
are quite flexible

00:07:25.279 --> 00:07:26.839
Want to buy a Pilates class?

00:07:26.959 --> 00:07:28.279
Great for women

00:07:29.879 --> 00:07:31.639
No need, I'll just do basic exercises

00:07:31.639 --> 00:07:34.000
You can try one free class now

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:35.120
If you buy today

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:36.720
we'll include a photo shoot

00:07:37.399 --> 00:07:37.879
Um...

00:07:37.959 --> 00:07:38.560
Really no need

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:40.000
Basic exercises are fine

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:41.839
Come on, let's take photos quickly

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:44.879
Okay

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:46.199
I'll edit the photos first

00:07:46.399 --> 00:07:48.160
Run 10 minutes to warm up

00:07:48.519 --> 00:07:49.600
Done shooting already?

00:07:55.439 --> 00:07:56.680
How about 5km first?

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:57.759
No problem

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:07.560
Add another 5km?

00:08:17.279 --> 00:08:17.800
Sis

00:08:18.079 --> 00:08:19.680
Warm-up was too short

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:20.800
Only five minutes

00:08:20.839 --> 00:08:21.800
Need proper warm-up

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:22.720
Can't do it

00:08:23.759 --> 00:08:24.519
Let's stop today

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:25.680
Haven't even started

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:27.519
Not started yet

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:31.480
First time, no experience

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:32.480
Went too hard

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:34.159
Let's try another day

00:08:34.159 --> 00:08:34.679
Sis

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:36.559
Just hire me

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.960
I'll be your personal trainer

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:41.559
Well...

00:08:41.559 --> 00:08:42.080
Next time

00:08:42.679 --> 00:08:43.559
We'll decide next time

00:08:57.039 --> 00:08:58.919
I saw your workout photos

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:00.240
How was it?

00:09:03.559 --> 00:09:04.679
Not bad

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:06.840
Trained too hard today

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:08.600
Scared the trainer

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:11.440
Think I lost 2 jin today

00:09:11.799 --> 00:09:13.159
15 jin this month

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:14.360
might be conservative

00:09:23.639 --> 00:09:24.440
Xiao Meng

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:27.159
Did you spend all money

00:09:27.159 --> 00:09:29.120
on your wife's gym memberships?

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:32.600
Our living standard is...

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:35.879
Longer life, more suffering

00:09:36.679 --> 00:09:38.519
Lili's working out lately

00:09:39.039 --> 00:09:40.080
Made specially for her

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:41.039
fitness meal

00:09:41.679 --> 00:09:43.200
What about me not working out?

00:09:43.279 --> 00:09:44.799
Even more need healthy food

00:09:46.039 --> 00:09:47.879
How to eat all this grass?

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:50.320
I'll go to the pet store

00:09:50.559 --> 00:09:51.519
Did someone

00:09:51.519 --> 00:09:54.000
steal the alpaca feed?

00:09:55.279 --> 00:09:55.879
It's fine

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:56.759
She won't starve

00:09:58.679 --> 00:10:00.279
I got you a small gift

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:03.279
No, this...

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:04.279
I'm really sorry

00:10:04.639 --> 00:10:05.919
I didn't get you anything

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:08.200
What's the occasion?

00:10:08.799 --> 00:10:10.559
No special occasion

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:12.879
Won't you gift me a gym card?

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:14.600
I'll prepare a gift too

00:10:14.759 --> 00:10:15.440
Wait for it

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:21.399
Look

00:10:23.799 --> 00:10:26.000
I see you watching these short videos every day

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:27.399
You must love it

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.399
After my workout today, I went to the mall

00:10:29.399 --> 00:10:30.360
Picked the biggest one

00:10:31.799 --> 00:10:33.240
This is too expensive

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:34.320
No

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:37.559
I'll just look at it

00:10:37.759 --> 00:10:39.440
Just looking isn't satisfying

00:10:39.759 --> 00:10:40.879
Building it would be great

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:42.759
Okay

00:10:43.799 --> 00:10:44.399
Thank you

00:10:46.159 --> 00:10:46.639
Don't worry

00:10:46.919 --> 00:10:48.360
I'll definitely finish building it

00:10:48.559 --> 00:10:49.039
Then

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:50.559
Display it at our wedding

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:51.480
Sounds good

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.000
Let me help you build it

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:53.799
No no no

00:10:54.039 --> 00:10:55.159
I'll build it alone

00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:56.360
After it's built

00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:58.600
At the wedding I'll hold this

00:10:58.879 --> 00:10:59.600
Castle

00:11:00.039 --> 00:11:00.559
Then

00:11:00.559 --> 00:11:02.240
Solemnly make my vow to you

00:11:02.519 --> 00:11:02.919
After that

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:03.600
I'll give the castle

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:04.360
To you

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:04.720
Deal

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:06.440
Wonderful

00:11:06.799 --> 00:11:08.240
I'm so happy today

00:11:08.519 --> 00:11:09.600
Let's order takeout

00:11:09.759 --> 00:11:10.159
Great

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:14.159
Okay Sis Li

00:11:14.399 --> 00:11:15.120
Not bad

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:16.200
Keep it up

00:11:16.519 --> 00:11:17.159
Good, very good

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:17.799
Hold that position

00:11:17.879 --> 00:11:18.279
Come on

00:11:18.559 --> 00:11:19.759
Feel your spine

00:11:19.799 --> 00:11:20.759
Up to your neck

00:11:20.759 --> 00:11:21.960
Good, hold it

00:11:22.559 --> 00:11:23.200
Good

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:23.919
Excellent

00:11:31.559 --> 00:11:32.200
Who is he?

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:35.080
A friend

00:11:35.399 --> 00:11:36.279
What kind of friend?

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:37.879
Just a regular friend

00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:42.360
When did this happen?

00:11:43.759 --> 00:11:44.600
What happened?

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:46.000
Nothing happened between us

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:47.960
Still making excuses

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:50.559
You're in his appointment book

00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:53.960
That was just a small favor between friends

00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:55.559
I signed without looking

00:11:55.559 --> 00:11:56.879
I didn't even know what it was

00:11:56.879 --> 00:11:57.960
Still won't admit it?

00:11:58.240 --> 00:11:59.600
Oscar already approached me

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:01.639
Asked me to give you up

00:12:02.879 --> 00:12:04.519
Why did you tell him everything?

00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:06.200
Misunderstanding

00:12:06.639 --> 00:12:07.080
It's really a misunderstanding

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:08.120
Misunderstanding

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:10.600
He said you've used equipment together

00:12:10.919 --> 00:12:12.639
That was just casual

00:12:12.639 --> 00:12:14.039
Meant nothing

00:12:15.639 --> 00:12:16.559
I... I'm so

00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:17.559
Disappointed

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:20.720
Let's part amicably

00:12:21.679 --> 00:12:22.720
Don't... don't be angry

00:12:22.879 --> 00:12:23.639
You... you could

00:12:24.039 --> 00:12:25.159
Let's try

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:26.879
A pay-per-session relationship

00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:29.559
What do you take me for?

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:34.960
Come on, Sis Li

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:35.840
Let's continue

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:40.759
Or maybe change positions

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:49.720
Good, very good.

00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:50.480
Sis Li.

00:12:50.879 --> 00:12:51.679
Hang in there.

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:53.000
Okay.

00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:53.720
Enough?

00:12:53.759 --> 00:12:54.600
Alright, done.

00:12:55.679 --> 00:12:56.559
First set done.

00:13:00.279 --> 00:13:01.879
What do you mean "first set done"?

00:13:02.799 --> 00:13:03.639
Six sets total today.

00:13:04.799 --> 00:13:06.000
Too many.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:07.000
Let's do one less.

00:13:07.519 --> 00:13:08.000
No.

00:13:10.759 --> 00:13:11.759
Can I take a break?

00:13:12.879 --> 00:13:13.399
One minute.

00:13:16.759 --> 00:13:17.320
Never mind.

00:13:17.679 --> 00:13:18.399
No break, Sis Li.

00:13:18.519 --> 00:13:18.879
No break.

00:13:18.879 --> 00:13:19.399
Let's go.

00:13:19.639 --> 00:13:20.039
Okay.

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:22.679
Nice, perfect.

00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:23.960
One more.

00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:26.519
Excellent.

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:27.240
Excellent, Sis Li.

00:13:27.279 --> 00:13:27.879
Got it.

00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:28.840
Come on, keep going.

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:27.919
Still going to the gym?

00:15:29.639 --> 00:15:30.720
Still not giving up?

00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:32.600
Of course not.

00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:34.360
I promised Menghang.

00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:36.240
I have to see it through.

00:15:36.679 --> 00:15:37.799
I can't do it anymore.

00:15:38.519 --> 00:15:39.759
Look at our meals.

00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:41.919
Even rabbits would call the cops.

00:15:44.639 --> 00:15:45.240
Menghang.

00:15:45.879 --> 00:15:47.720
Mom has a point.

00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:50.559
Let's eat normally for now.

00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:51.720
Sure.

00:15:52.159 --> 00:15:52.519
Lili.

00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:53.679
Whatever you say.

00:15:53.919 --> 00:15:55.840
If it's too hard for you,

00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:57.600
you don't have to go every time.

00:15:57.759 --> 00:15:59.120
You've worked all week.

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:00.600
Take a break.

00:16:00.919 --> 00:16:01.759
It's fine.

00:16:01.879 --> 00:16:03.039
I'm not tired at all.

00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:05.000
I read an article before,

00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:06.000
saying humans...

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:08.600
People...

00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:10.000
get more tired the more they lie down.

00:16:10.519 --> 00:16:12.799
Exercise is a form of rest.

00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:15.000
Send me that article link.

00:16:15.159 --> 00:16:16.000
I'll report it.

00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:20.679
You're that determined?

00:16:20.919 --> 00:16:21.879
Of course.

00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:23.399
I made a promise to you.

00:16:23.399 --> 00:16:24.480
How can I back out?

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.639
Plus, we're about to get married.

00:16:26.919 --> 00:16:29.159
Promises can't be broken just like that.

00:16:29.399 --> 00:16:30.360
Right, right.

00:16:30.799 --> 00:16:31.200
Right.

00:16:32.039 --> 00:16:34.039
But Menghang, your dark circles...

00:16:34.039 --> 00:16:35.240
are getting worse.

00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:40.440
Fell asleep building LEGOs again?

00:16:41.639 --> 00:16:42.840
Maybe just give up.

00:16:43.519 --> 00:16:44.559
How can I give up?

00:16:44.919 --> 00:16:45.879
I made a promise.

00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:46.960
Can't just regret it now.

00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:47.679
No way.

00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:48.679
Don't worry.

00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:52.399
I'll finish building it.

00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:55.279
If working out is too tiring,

00:16:55.759 --> 00:16:56.960
I'm not tired at all.

00:16:57.240 --> 00:16:59.559
I'm addicted to working out now.

00:17:00.399 --> 00:17:01.600
If I skip a day,

00:17:01.879 --> 00:17:03.879
I feel awful.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.880
Really awful.

00:17:07.559 --> 00:17:08.000
Okay.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:10.000
Then let's...

00:17:11.599 --> 00:17:12.839
mutually...

00:17:13.079 --> 00:17:13.960
supervise each other.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.680
Work hard together.

00:17:17.799 --> 00:17:19.319
Whoever suffers knows it.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:41.319
Sis.

00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:42.039
What brings you here?

00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:43.039
I thought...

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:44.759
I'd check on your work.

00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:46.039
I have bubble tea shop experience.

00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:47.599
Mixing drinks is easy for me.

00:17:48.359 --> 00:17:49.039
Alright then.

00:17:50.039 --> 00:17:50.480
Come on.

00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:53.720
Got any food here?

00:17:54.079 --> 00:17:54.880
You went to the gym?

00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:01.440
I'm an average drinker.

00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:03.400
We have...

00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:04.720
veggie salad and avocados.

00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:08.039
How about...

00:18:08.559 --> 00:18:09.640
Get me a beef burger.

00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:10.640
Hold the bun.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:13.759
Just the beef.

00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:24.559
Don't tell your brother-in-law yet.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:25.759
Did you two have a fight?

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:26.640
No.

00:18:28.039 --> 00:18:28.559
I see.

00:18:29.279 --> 00:18:30.480
Are you meeting someone else here?

00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:32.400
Don't talk nonsense.

00:18:33.079 --> 00:18:34.200
At this time,

00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:35.720
I should be at the gym.

00:18:37.119 --> 00:18:37.920
Got it.

00:18:38.119 --> 00:18:39.240
My brother-in-law forced you to work out?

00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:40.200
I'll talk to him.

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:40.839
No, no, no.

00:18:40.839 --> 00:18:41.200
That's not it.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:43.279
He didn't force me. I volunteered.

00:18:44.119 --> 00:18:45.160
Can you explain clearly?

00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:47.240
I volunteered.

00:18:47.599 --> 00:18:48.400
This whole thing is

00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:50.119
too complicated now.

00:18:50.319 --> 00:18:51.880
Anyway, I'm stuck now,

00:18:52.039 --> 00:18:53.160
so I have to tough it out.

00:18:57.680 --> 00:18:58.839
What time are you coming today?

00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:00.599
I'm already dressed and waiting.

00:19:00.839 --> 00:19:01.359
Look at this.

00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:03.319
My old coach got injured,

00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:04.920
and they assigned me a new one.

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:05.640
See?

00:19:07.279 --> 00:19:08.400
I want to block her.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:09.759
Yes, block her.

00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:19.319
Can I really block her?

00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:21.359
She's already changed clothes.

00:19:22.079 --> 00:19:23.200
Can't just leave her hanging.

00:19:24.279 --> 00:19:25.000
Maybe I should go.

00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:27.359
You go?

00:19:27.839 --> 00:19:28.599
What else can we do?

00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:29.880
Your gym membership is expensive.

00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:31.200
Wouldn't it be a waste not to go?

00:19:32.039 --> 00:19:32.960
I'll work out for you from now on.

00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:34.319
I'll send you the workout data daily.

00:19:34.519 --> 00:19:35.519
Then you can post it on social media.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:37.000
That way my brother-in-law won't notice.

00:19:41.759 --> 00:19:42.720
Fine.

00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:44.400
But you have to stick with it.

00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:45.119
Don't quit halfway.

00:19:45.119 --> 00:19:45.880
This is quite expensive.

00:19:46.799 --> 00:19:47.400
Alright.

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:48.759
Sis, for you,

00:19:49.079 --> 00:19:49.759
I'll see it through.

00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:50.640
Deal.

00:19:51.319 --> 00:19:52.440
But you have to cover my shifts.

00:19:52.799 --> 00:19:53.519
Our boss is gone,

00:19:53.519 --> 00:19:54.400
traveling for a month.

00:19:55.079 --> 00:19:56.119
There aren't many customers anyway.

00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:57.119
Just watch the store for me.

00:19:57.319 --> 00:19:57.839
Then it's settled.

00:19:58.359 --> 00:19:58.920
Go ahead.

00:19:59.319 --> 00:20:00.640
Don't let your brother-in-law find out.

00:20:01.359 --> 00:20:01.960
Deal.

00:20:02.279 --> 00:20:02.880
Cheers.

00:20:11.519 --> 00:20:12.000
Coach.

00:20:12.319 --> 00:20:12.839
I'm here.

00:20:13.319 --> 00:20:14.039
You are...?

00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:15.160
Didn't you urge me to come?

00:20:15.599 --> 00:20:16.400
Let's begin.

00:20:17.279 --> 00:20:18.279
Then hurry inside.

00:20:18.359 --> 00:20:19.240
The coach is waiting.

00:20:19.839 --> 00:20:20.799
Aren't you my coach?

00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:21.799
I'm the salesperson.

00:20:22.079 --> 00:20:22.960
He's your coach.

00:20:23.839 --> 00:20:25.440
Faster, only a hundred reps.

00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:30.279
Can I get a refund?

00:20:37.039 --> 00:20:37.920
That was so hard.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:40.400
Finally finished this section.

00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:43.920
But there are still

00:20:44.039 --> 00:20:45.039
over forty pieces left.

00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:46.480
Is this normal?

00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:50.720
It shouldn't be noticeable.

00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:54.720
Darn it, darn it.

00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:55.519
It's still noticeable.

00:20:57.200 --> 00:20:59.119
Why is the first-floor toilet on the second-floor dining table?

00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:02.960
What went wrong?

00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:07.319
What went...

00:21:18.759 --> 00:21:20.279
Leave one page unbuilt.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.279
Don't tell me I have to redo it.

00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:30.880
So annoying.

00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:33.799
My brother‑in‑law’s home.

00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:39.319
What’s up with you?

00:21:39.839 --> 00:21:40.680
Went too hard working out.

00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:41.759
My thighs are killing me.

00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:44.440
Nah, I’ve been training a lot.

00:21:45.279 --> 00:21:46.279
Your pecs even got bigger.

00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:48.519
Feels like you’ve trained too.

00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:49.920
Your head’s gotten bigger.

00:21:50.759 --> 00:21:52.200
That’s from building LEGO.

00:21:53.559 --> 00:21:54.440
Such a huge castle?

00:21:55.039 --> 00:21:56.279
Your sister bought it for me.

00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:57.200
Figures.

00:21:57.200 --> 00:21:58.200
Once I finish it for her,

00:21:58.319 --> 00:21:59.319
we’ll put it at our wedding.

00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:02.480
Bro‑in‑law, you really know stuff.

00:22:02.759 --> 00:22:03.559
Building LEGO like this,

00:22:03.559 --> 00:22:05.079
it’s just like a marriage.

00:22:05.319 --> 00:22:06.079
You don’t need to think.

00:22:06.279 --> 00:22:07.119
You just put in the time.

00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:09.279
What’s that supposed to mean?

00:22:09.759 --> 00:22:10.640
It’s easy.

00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:13.559
So between rich dads and hard work,

00:22:13.799 --> 00:22:15.000
the young all choose LEGO.

00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:17.759
That’s easy then.

00:22:18.039 --> 00:22:18.920
Help me build it.

00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:21.839
My sis won’t let you?

00:22:22.359 --> 00:22:23.720
She won’t know if we don’t tell.

00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:25.920
I could never lie to my sis.

00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:28.200
I’ve got this cousin‑uncle.

00:22:28.759 --> 00:22:30.240
His daughter’s blind‑dating now.

00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:31.319
So I told him,

00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:33.440
“My wife’s brother’s a great catch.”

00:22:33.599 --> 00:22:34.880
Look, here’s her photo.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.039
My sis wants me happy too, right?

00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:50.480
She hits the gym every Sat at two.

00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:52.119
So you

00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:53.880
can only build here then.

00:22:54.359 --> 00:22:54.920
And

00:22:55.119 --> 00:22:56.839
you must finish two sets each trip.

00:22:57.079 --> 00:22:57.799
Once it works out,

00:22:57.799 --> 00:22:59.400
I’ll give you her contact.

00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:00.079
But wait—

00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:01.480
What if I finish building,

00:23:01.559 --> 00:23:02.599
and she starts dating someone?

00:23:02.599 --> 00:23:03.440
What do I do then?

00:23:03.599 --> 00:23:04.759
Arms straight.

00:23:05.039 --> 00:23:07.000
Hold firm. Come on.

00:23:10.279 --> 00:23:10.799
Cool.

00:23:13.799 --> 00:23:14.319
Nice.

00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:16.720
Cool, very cool.

00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:20.039
Bro‑in‑law, can we talk?

00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:20.839
Change the time.

00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:21.680
Anytime but now.

00:23:21.759 --> 00:23:22.680
Any other time works.

00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:24.440
But why can’t you?

00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:25.960
You might not believe this.

00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:27.119
How about this instead:

00:23:27.519 --> 00:23:28.480
I take the LEGO and build it.

00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:29.880
I’ll bring it back once it’s done.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:34.200
You’re pretty strong.

00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:46.880
Then you have to promise me

00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:49.079
before your sister gets back
from the gym

00:23:49.279 --> 00:23:49.960
you bring it back to me.

00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:51.720
But you have to promise

00:23:51.799 --> 00:23:53.240
after every workout

00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:54.440
you send me your stats.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:55.640
Remember,

00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:57.839
do not let your sister
or brother‑in‑law know.

00:23:57.839 --> 00:23:58.880
Three hundred fifty‑two

00:23:59.279 --> 00:24:00.519
Three hundred fifty‑three

00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:02.200
Three hundred fifty‑four

00:24:02.799 --> 00:24:04.200
Three hundred fifty‑five

00:24:04.759 --> 00:24:05.799
Three hundred fifty‑six

00:24:06.119 --> 00:24:07.279
This is today’s.

00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:08.559
Just one last piece left.

00:24:09.559 --> 00:24:11.119
Are you building or wrecking it?

00:24:11.119 --> 00:24:12.119
Come on, come on, give it here.

00:24:12.319 --> 00:24:13.279
Then you build it.

00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:13.960
I’m heading out.

00:24:14.759 --> 00:24:15.440
Don’t go yet.

00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:16.319
Your sister will be back soon.

00:24:16.319 --> 00:24:17.119
We can all eat together.

00:24:17.119 --> 00:24:17.880
I’ll cook right away.

00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:19.519
I don’t want to eat
with you two now.

00:24:19.799 --> 00:24:20.960
I want to eat
with a girl.

00:24:24.279 --> 00:24:25.839
Your calf muscles
are really popping.

00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:29.119
Look at how hard
this guy’s trained.

00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:31.200
He’s like a new person.

00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:32.119
Thank you, really.

00:24:32.319 --> 00:24:32.920
Don’t thank me.

00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:33.559
Thank your brother‑in‑law.

00:24:34.079 --> 00:24:34.559
Right.

00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:35.519
Then thank both of you.

00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:36.880
Thanks to your whole family.

00:24:37.599 --> 00:24:38.400
This kid…

00:24:38.799 --> 00:24:40.119
why’s he so polite?

00:24:40.319 --> 00:24:40.920
Go on.

00:24:41.279 --> 00:24:42.240
Three hundred sixty‑one

00:24:42.799 --> 00:24:44.240
Three hundred sixty‑two

00:24:44.759 --> 00:24:45.920
Three hundred sixty‑three

00:24:46.559 --> 00:24:47.640
Three hundred sixty‑four

00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:48.440
Keep it up.

00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:56.240
Bro‑in‑law, this castle—

00:24:56.319 --> 00:24:57.640
missing a bedroom’s
no big deal, right?

00:24:58.319 --> 00:24:59.039
Li Cai,

00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:01.079
are you at the bar now?

00:25:01.559 --> 00:25:02.519
I’m free this afternoon.

00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:03.880
I’ll come over
to see you.

00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:05.559
If you’ve finished building,

00:25:05.839 --> 00:25:07.000
I’ll just bring it back
with me.

00:25:07.039 --> 00:25:08.279
Saves you another trip.

00:25:23.359 --> 00:25:24.039
Li Cai,

00:25:25.519 --> 00:25:26.200
Li Cai,

00:25:28.119 --> 00:25:28.799
Li Cai,

00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:33.240
Li Cai.

00:25:42.759 --> 00:25:43.640
I’m at home.

00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:45.119
Building LEGO.

00:25:45.279 --> 00:25:46.119
All by myself.

00:25:46.839 --> 00:25:47.559
Almost done.

00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:48.920
Wait till you come back
and see.

00:26:08.079 --> 00:26:08.519
Li Cai,

00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:10.079
I’m at the bar.
Where are you?

00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:11.079
You’re at the bar?

00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:11.960
I’m at the gy—

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:14.640
I’m building the castle
for you.

00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:16.720
Didn’t I message you?

00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:18.200
Just now,

00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:19.000
the bar was packed.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:19.839
I probably missed it.

00:26:20.759 --> 00:26:21.599
I’m in the lobby
right now.

00:26:21.599 --> 00:26:22.359
Hurry over here.

00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:27.240
What’s that noise?

00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:31.079
The bathroom, I guess.

00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:33.519
You’re in the bathroom?

00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:34.920
No.

00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:35.920
Where’s my LEGO?

00:26:36.039 --> 00:26:37.119
Hurry and send me
a picture.

00:26:37.519 --> 00:26:38.680
I’m still building
the LEGO.

00:26:39.039 --> 00:26:40.119
Building LEGO
in the bathroom?

00:26:40.839 --> 00:26:41.880
Y‑you… open,
open the door.

00:26:42.039 --> 00:26:42.440
No.

00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:43.039
Don’t come over.

00:26:43.039 --> 00:26:44.279
I’ve got the runs,
it really stinks.

00:26:45.319 --> 00:26:46.279
How about this,
you’re in a rush, right?

00:26:46.279 --> 00:26:46.960
I’ll send you a pic.

00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:48.559
Okay, fine, just hurry.

00:27:20.519 --> 00:27:22.039
Isn’t this Lili’s bag?

00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:39.119
Lili?

00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:40.400
You…

00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:41.880
where are you?

00:27:42.519 --> 00:27:43.119
What are you doing?

00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:56.279
Send me a selfie.

00:27:57.319 --> 00:27:58.039
I want to see.

00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:23.079
Why are they all
close‑ups?

00:28:23.519 --> 00:28:25.000
Got any taken from farther away?

00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:37.519
Li Cai

00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:38.799
You’re still not ready?

00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:40.279
Li Cai

00:28:41.359 --> 00:28:42.000
Li Cai

00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:43.839
Are you in there?

00:28:44.359 --> 00:28:44.960
Li Cai

00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:46.720
I-Is anyone in there?

00:28:47.759 --> 00:28:48.960
Someone say something.

00:28:50.319 --> 00:28:51.160
You okay?

00:29:11.039 --> 00:29:11.960
Over there, on your end—

00:29:12.119 --> 00:29:12.839
why is there

00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:14.240
a woman’s voice?

00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:16.960
M-Maybe it’s, uh,

00:29:17.799 --> 00:29:18.920
the TV or something.

00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:21.599
W-What’s wrong, w-what is it?

00:29:28.559 --> 00:29:30.759
Nothing. I meant to call my mom.

00:29:30.759 --> 00:29:32.240
Darn it, I misdialed and got you.

00:29:46.559 --> 00:29:47.000
Cai.

00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:48.680
Hi.

00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:51.279
Li Cai.

00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:10.640
Li Li.

00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:11.920
I’ll come pick you up.

00:30:12.119 --> 00:30:13.279
I-I’ll head out right now.

00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:25.720
Li Li.

00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:27.079
I’m at the gym entrance.

00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:27.839
Come out.

00:30:28.039 --> 00:30:28.880
We’ll go home together.

00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:30.079
Um…

00:30:30.279 --> 00:30:31.240
I went early today.

00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:32.200
I left a long time ago.

00:30:32.319 --> 00:30:33.319
I’m almost home now.

00:30:38.119 --> 00:30:39.480
You’re cheating.

00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:01.319
So where did you go?

00:31:02.119 --> 00:31:03.119
I went to work out.

00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:04.359
Where did you go?

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:05.279
No, listen—

00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:07.599
I went to the gym to get you.

00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:08.920
They said you d-didn’t go.

00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:11.359
That’s impossible.

00:31:11.759 --> 00:31:14.079
Did you ask the wrong person, not see me?

00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:18.440
What did you train today?

00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:21.759
Today, anaerobic plus strength.

00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:22.680
I’m exhausted.

00:31:24.359 --> 00:31:25.279
You remembered wrong.

00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:28.319
It was “no booze, more drinks,” right?

00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:30.799
Nonsense. Who trains like that?

00:31:34.039 --> 00:31:34.759
Is this yours?

00:31:39.279 --> 00:31:40.319
I was at Da Liu's bar

00:31:40.319 --> 00:31:41.599
and I saw your bag.

00:31:43.559 --> 00:31:45.039
You were at Da Liu's bar?

00:31:45.279 --> 00:31:46.720
Didn't you say you'd build LEGO at home?

00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:47.559
You even sent photos.

00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:48.759
You lied to me.

00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:50.440
I didn't.

00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:52.279
I just… I just went to the bar for you.

00:31:52.279 --> 00:31:53.960
You went to Da Liu's bar to find me?

00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:55.200
Who were you looking for?

00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:57.319
No, I only went there for you.

00:31:58.599 --> 00:31:59.480
Meng Hang.

00:32:00.079 --> 00:32:01.039
It's okay.

00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:04.000
Everyone makes mistakes sometimes.

00:32:04.799 --> 00:32:05.839
If you did it, just admit it.

00:32:05.839 --> 00:32:07.079
No need to hide it from me.

00:32:07.279 --> 00:32:09.400
What did I do? I did nothing.

00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:10.000
What's wrong?

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:10.880
How would I know?

00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:13.000
Bro-in-law, I finished your LEGO.

00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:14.160
It was so hard to build.

00:32:16.519 --> 00:32:19.680
He asked you to build his LEGO?

00:32:20.319 --> 00:32:21.119
You kid…

00:32:21.119 --> 00:32:22.759
Why'd you build my LEGO?

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:24.079
Sis, why did you come back?

00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:25.680
Shouldn't you be at the bar for my shift?

00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:26.920
Now no one's watching the bar.

00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:29.200
You kid…

00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:30.960
Why go there? I don't even drink.

00:32:31.599 --> 00:32:32.319
I can't handle that job.

00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:33.640
What is going on?

00:32:33.759 --> 00:32:35.079
Yeah, what's with you?

00:32:36.079 --> 00:32:36.960
What's happening?

00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:41.400
That's all there is.

00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:43.720
You two both came to me.

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:45.160
And neither could tell the other.

00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:46.759
Told you this would blow up.

00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:50.880
Li Li.

00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:53.640
If you didn't want to go, say so.

00:32:54.079 --> 00:32:55.359
Why go through all this trouble?

00:32:56.519 --> 00:32:58.799
I set that goal way too high.

00:32:58.799 --> 00:33:00.039
I was embarrassed to say it.

00:33:00.559 --> 00:33:03.400
And you gave me such a pricey gym card.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:04.920
It's not about the price.

00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:06.680
What matters is you're happy.

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:09.640
Then does LEGO make you happy?

00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:10.559
Yes, it does.

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:12.960
But I realized

00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:14.720
building LEGO is like trading stocks.

00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:16.559
The most thrilling moment

00:33:16.759 --> 00:33:18.160
is when you buy in.

00:33:18.519 --> 00:33:20.079
After that it’s endless torture.

00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:21.240
This…

00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:22.920
300‑plus pages of instructions

00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:24.079
is just like the stock index.

00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:25.039
I don't get it at all.

00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:26.480
And then I'm totally trapped.

00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:28.480
Wasn't I the one to build it?

00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:30.279
You, stop talking.

00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:34.000
Honestly, it's mainly my fault.

00:33:34.079 --> 00:33:35.359
I overestimated my LEGO skills.

00:33:37.559 --> 00:33:38.599
And I ended up lying to you.

00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:39.440
What for, really?

00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:41.440
Same here.

00:33:42.039 --> 00:33:42.680
Actually,

00:33:42.799 --> 00:33:45.039
the gym doesn’t help me that much.

00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:47.200
But I get lots of likes online.

00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:48.720
So I got vain.

00:33:49.119 --> 00:33:50.880
Aren't those likes from me and him?

00:33:51.799 --> 00:33:52.519
You, stop talking.

00:33:54.519 --> 00:33:55.720
Why did we do this to each other?

00:33:56.480 --> 00:33:57.759
All this time I was lying,

00:33:57.920 --> 00:33:59.119
I felt so guilty inside.

00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:00.240
Me too.

00:34:00.519 --> 00:34:01.039
It's fine.

00:34:01.119 --> 00:34:02.359
Let’s not bring up the past.

00:34:02.799 --> 00:34:04.200
From now on, this LEGO set

00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:05.039
the two of us will just…

00:34:05.519 --> 00:34:06.359
make Li Cai build it.

00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:08.079
Why me?

00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:10.440
Thirty percent is destiny,

00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:11.519
seventy depends on hard work.

00:34:11.559 --> 00:34:15.440
If you fight, you can win.

00:34:15.719 --> 00:34:16.559
Let whoever loves it build it.

00:34:16.679 --> 00:34:17.559
I don't want this thing.

00:34:18.159 --> 00:34:19.360
Can you give me that gym card?

00:34:19.599 --> 00:34:20.000
Take it.

00:34:20.239 --> 00:34:20.920
That gym

00:34:21.039 --> 00:34:22.440
might as well be made for you.

00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:23.480
Awesome.

00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:25.280
You've worked hard at the gym.

00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:26.760
Oh, I also pushed my cousin‑uncle’s

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:28.119
daughter’s WeChat contact to you.

00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:29.000
No need.

00:34:29.119 --> 00:34:30.480
I have to go to the gym every day now.

00:34:30.639 --> 00:34:31.280
Cindy

00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:32.039
is still waiting for me.

00:34:35.079 --> 00:34:35.519
I’m off.

00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:42.920
It actually works pretty well.

00:34:45.119 --> 00:34:46.639
You seem heavier, Cindy.

00:34:47.639 --> 00:34:48.840
I’m Cindy’s family member.

00:34:49.119 --> 00:34:50.039
I’m Cindy’s plus-one.

00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:51.559
We’re adding six sets today.

00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:00.840
Humans

00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:02.320
are really strange creatures.

00:35:02.679 --> 00:35:03.480
Some things

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:05.239
you might not even like,

00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:06.800
yet you must own them.

00:35:07.159 --> 00:35:07.679
For example,

00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:09.119
a job and a marriage.

00:35:09.519 --> 00:35:10.400
Some things

00:35:10.559 --> 00:35:12.480
you genuinely like a lot,

00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:13.400
but

00:35:13.559 --> 00:35:14.760
you don’t need to own.

00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:16.840
LEGO, for me,

00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:18.119
is exactly like that.

00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:20.159
I really like it,

00:35:20.719 --> 00:35:22.679
and love watching others build it.

00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:25.360
But I don’t like building it myself.

00:35:26.599 --> 00:35:28.880
The greatest emotional value it gives me

00:35:29.039 --> 00:35:30.480
is admiring it from afar,

00:35:30.719 --> 00:35:31.800
not actually owning it.

00:35:32.599 --> 00:35:33.400
Let me give an example.

00:35:34.119 --> 00:35:34.760
Li Li

00:35:35.119 --> 00:35:36.400
has collected lots of

00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:39.400
hard-to-swallow diet recipes.

00:35:40.239 --> 00:35:40.840
If—

00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:42.599
I mean if,

00:35:43.679 --> 00:35:44.280
one day

00:35:44.639 --> 00:35:47.400
I suddenly used all those recipes

00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:49.239
to cook every dish for her

00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:50.119
and made her eat them,

00:35:50.599 --> 00:35:51.320
what do you think

00:35:52.039 --> 00:35:53.639
would happen?

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:56.880
Catering to someone’s taste

00:35:57.519 --> 00:35:58.440
can be dangerous.

00:36:00.119 --> 00:36:01.679
If you see on my phone

00:36:02.239 --> 00:36:03.159
that I’ve got LEGO,

00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:04.719
and you buy me LEGO because of that,

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:06.840
then if you see a pretty girl?

00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:09.880
Then I’ll “gift” you a slap.
