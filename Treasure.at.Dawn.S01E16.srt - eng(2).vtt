00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:35.350
it's like you're a different person.

00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:37.800
Write down what I say.

00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:39.440
Okay.

00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:42.300
Lei Juekun, the deceased,

00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:43.400
is 180 centimeters tall.

00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:45.320
His physical form is normal.

00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:46.840
His skin color is normal.

00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:49.750
His head appearance is normal.

00:19:51.030 --> 00:19:52.650
There is no clouding inside his eyes.

00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:55.310
There are a lot of black viscous liquids in his body.

00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:56.830
Speak slowly.

00:19:57.110 --> 00:19:57.830
What's wrong with his head?

00:20:02.830 --> 00:20:03.480
You don't have to write it.

00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:04.720
He died of overeating.

00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:11.470
What did he eat?

00:20:33.030 --> 00:20:33.510
Come on.

00:20:35.510 --> 00:20:36.240
Try the tofu.

00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:40.960
Is it delicious?

00:20:42.030 --> 00:20:42.480
No.

00:20:42.830 --> 00:20:43.590
It doesn't taste like it used to.

00:20:44.590 --> 00:20:46.160
When we were poor,

00:20:46.790 --> 00:20:47.750
we killed three people

00:20:48.550 --> 00:20:49.350
for a piece of tofu.

00:20:50.550 --> 00:20:51.200
But

00:20:51.830 --> 00:20:53.000
that piece of tofu was sour.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.680
But he said the tofu was delicious.

00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:58.110
Maybe we killed people for that.

00:20:58.920 --> 00:20:59.790
That piece of tofu was delicious.

00:21:00.350 --> 00:21:00.830
Seriously.

00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:03.000
Try the bamboo shoot.

00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:06.350
Slow down.

00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:08.920
Before the bamboo shoot grows,

00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:12.090
it lies dormant in bamboo leaves and mud for three months.

00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:14.270
If you don't eat it

00:21:14.550 --> 00:21:15.350
in these three months,

00:21:15.830 --> 00:21:17.750
it will grow 10 meters in a day and become bamboo in a few days.

00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:18.720
Really?

00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:21.400
I'm not eating it.

00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:23.050
Where are you going?

00:21:23.270 --> 00:21:24.850
I'll plant it.

00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:26.370
Come back.

00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:31.530
I'm sorry to let you see this.

00:21:32.590 --> 00:21:33.740
Do you know me?

00:21:34.830 --> 00:21:35.640
Yes.

00:21:35.850 --> 00:21:36.720
You are

00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:39.640
Steward Sun of the Jibei Chamber of Commerce.

00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:40.620
Good.

00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:43.680
Let's get down to business.

00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:47.410
How long

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:49.810
have you been dormant

00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:51.280
in Xichuan?

00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:53.510
Steward Sun.

00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:55.150
I don't know

00:21:55.150 --> 00:21:57.190
what you're talking about.

00:21:58.110 --> 00:21:59.240
Why did you escape?

00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:01.090
I was scared.

00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:01.800
What are you afraid of?

00:22:02.430 --> 00:22:03.320
Several people

00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:05.730
died in Xichuan.

00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:07.110
They died

00:22:07.630 --> 00:22:09.520
after I told their stories.

00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:12.150
Who would believe

00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:13.760
that it has nothing to do with me?

00:22:14.630 --> 00:22:16.080
What's wrong with me?

00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:16.560
I...

00:22:17.110 --> 00:22:19.800
I don't know what's wrong with me.

00:22:22.190 --> 00:22:23.000
You're a prophet.

00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:24.590
Whatever you say, it happens.

00:22:24.820 --> 00:22:25.430
No.

00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:26.320
All right.

00:22:27.630 --> 00:22:28.870
Please do me a favor.

00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:31.560
Praise me.

00:22:32.210 --> 00:22:32.630
Come on.

00:22:41.070 --> 00:22:41.590
You...

00:22:42.030 --> 00:22:42.640
Praise me.

00:22:43.550 --> 00:22:44.560
You...

00:22:44.590 --> 00:22:45.240
Praise me.

00:22:48.590 --> 00:22:49.320
Steward Sun.

00:22:49.330 --> 00:22:50.780
You are gifted.

00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:52.240
You are strong and wise.

00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:55.000
You will have a harem and many children.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:56.070
You will be rich.

00:22:57.350 --> 00:22:58.790
Please spare me.

00:22:58.790 --> 00:23:00.440
I don't want to die.

00:23:07.550 --> 00:23:08.030
Thank you.

00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:12.240
If I die tonight,

00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:13.880
you take the money.

00:23:14.550 --> 00:23:16.270
With your ability, when you return to Jibei,

00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:18.960
you can join the army. It won't be long

00:23:19.110 --> 00:23:20.120
before you become an official.

00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:21.290
No.

00:23:21.290 --> 00:23:22.550
If I don't die,

00:23:22.550 --> 00:23:23.640
you take the money as well.

00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:24.880
Continue being a storyteller.

00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:28.200
Praise Li Zhizhuo of the Jibei Chamber of Commerce.

00:23:29.110 --> 00:23:29.960
I'd like to see

00:23:32.070 --> 00:23:33.240
who's tougher,

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:36.070
you or me.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:50.200
He died of overeating?

00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:52.080
No way.

00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:54.110
My lord paid attention to his diet.

00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:55.830
He wouldn't eat too much.

00:23:56.030 --> 00:23:57.400
It's really hard to believe.

00:23:58.200 --> 00:23:59.680
What did Mr. Lei eat?

00:24:00.310 --> 00:24:00.960
Yesterday,

00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:02.960
my lord didn't eat at the mansion.

00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:04.750
In the morning,

00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:06.350
he took me to pick up a batch of goods.

00:24:06.790 --> 00:24:08.240
It was a batch of nice silk.

00:24:11.790 --> 00:24:12.270
Stop.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.000
Why are they fighting again?

00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:15.960
Looks like

00:24:16.310 --> 00:24:17.350
we can't pass in a while.

00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:24.160
We can't wait here.

00:24:24.590 --> 00:24:25.070
Look.

00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:26.640
Ask all carriages to turn around.

00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:27.790
We'll go another way.

00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:28.550
Okay.

00:24:30.310 --> 00:24:31.440
Everyone, we'll go another way.

00:24:31.790 --> 00:24:33.200
Turn around. Go.

00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:36.440
Help. Fire.

00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:38.790
Stop. Don't move.

00:24:39.030 --> 00:24:39.590
Stop.

00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:42.680
Let everyone keep an eye on the goods.

00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:44.240
Looks like we have to wait.

00:24:44.830 --> 00:24:45.240
Okay.

00:24:48.350 --> 00:24:50.030
We didn't leave the market

00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:52.300
until the first quarter of the Shen hour.

00:24:52.510 --> 00:24:53.600
Then, we unloaded the goods in the east of the city.

00:24:53.910 --> 00:24:54.820
Then,

00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:56.430
my lord and I went back to the mansion

00:24:56.910 --> 00:24:57.670
and never went out.

00:24:58.390 --> 00:24:59.280
What time did you arrive at the mansion?

00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:00.670
I think

00:25:00.910 --> 00:25:01.670
it was the You hour.

00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:04.390
Didn't you eat before you got back to the mansion?

00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:05.240
No.

00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:06.800
After noon,

00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:08.830
my lord was hungry.

00:25:09.110 --> 00:25:11.150
He asked me to buy some dog meat from a peddler.

00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:12.760
There was a peddler?

00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:14.390
There were many people

00:25:14.390 --> 00:25:15.480
stuck in traffic.

00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:17.870
So, there were peddlers carrying baskets

00:25:18.190 --> 00:25:19.420
and selling dog meat along the street.

00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:21.090
My lord was wary.

00:25:21.430 --> 00:25:22.320
After buying dog meat,

00:25:22.590 --> 00:25:23.720
he tested it with a silver needle to see if it was poisonous.

00:25:24.110 --> 00:25:25.800
He didn't eat it until he saw

00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:26.960
that the others were fine

00:25:27.430 --> 00:25:28.280
after eating.

00:25:30.870 --> 00:25:32.000
What else did he eat after that?

00:25:34.110 --> 00:25:35.420
After we got back to the mansion,

00:25:35.420 --> 00:25:36.570
my lord had a bad appetite.

00:25:36.870 --> 00:25:37.960
He didn't eat anything after that.

00:25:38.830 --> 00:25:39.860
After he got back,

00:25:39.910 --> 00:25:41.190
he drank a few bowls of fire-remove soup.

00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:42.800
What?

00:25:43.110 --> 00:25:44.250
It was from the kitchen.

00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:45.320
I didn't ask.

00:25:45.670 --> 00:25:46.580
Where is the cook?

00:25:47.110 --> 00:25:48.800
Cook, get the soup.

00:25:49.110 --> 00:25:50.670
Butler.

00:25:50.910 --> 00:25:52.490
It has nothing to do with me.

00:25:52.670 --> 00:25:53.350
I heard

00:25:53.350 --> 00:25:54.760
our lord went to pick up goods,

00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:56.870
and they stayed in the sun for a long time.

00:25:57.320 --> 00:25:58.590
There was no water.

00:25:59.430 --> 00:26:00.350
And there was a fire.

00:26:00.630 --> 00:26:02.590
So I made this fire-remove soup.

00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:04.670
It couldn't be poisonous.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:05.670
If you don't believe me,

00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:06.560
I'll show it to you.

00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:08.370
Beware of him drinking it and committing suicide.

00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:09.320
Stop.

00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:12.630
Do you want to destroy the evidence?

00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:25.670
You taste everything.

00:26:26.190 --> 00:26:27.350
You'll be poisoned sooner or later.

00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:29.800
It's mung bean soup, right?

00:26:31.630 --> 00:26:32.280
That's right.

00:26:33.630 --> 00:26:34.830
Eating mung beans with dog meat

00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:36.390
can cause bloating.

00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:38.240
Mr. Lei

00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:39.560
ate a lot of dog meat in the afternoon

00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:41.040
and drank

00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:42.870
a lot of mung bean soup.

00:26:43.670 --> 00:26:45.760
That's why he died of bloating.

00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:47.650
In that case,

00:26:47.870 --> 00:26:50.000
it's a coincidence, not a murder.

00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:51.350
I think

00:26:51.910 --> 00:26:53.240
it's weird.

00:26:55.180 --> 00:26:57.700
[Wenfu Hall]

00:26:57.720 --> 00:26:59.670
Lord Wen, what brings you here?

00:27:00.190 --> 00:27:01.590
I heard that another person died yesterday.

00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:03.000
Yes.

00:27:03.670 --> 00:27:04.240
He died of bloating.

[Moral and Artistic Stature]
Lightning strike, falling from a horse,

00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:10.080
and bloating.

00:27:10.150 --> 00:27:11.870
They all died in strange ways.

00:27:11.870 --> 00:27:13.240
But we couldn't find anything wrong.

00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:15.290
Could it really be a ghost?

00:27:15.870 --> 00:27:16.920
I don't think so.

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:19.050
Even though

00:27:19.590 --> 00:27:20.870
we haven't found a clue yet.

00:27:21.110 --> 00:27:22.190
Me too.

00:27:23.110 --> 00:27:25.630
Jibei Chamber of Commerce and the Ma Gang clashed yesterday.

00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:27.590
I arrived in time

00:27:27.910 --> 00:27:29.280
to avoid a disaster.

00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:31.480
If we can't find the murderer,

00:27:32.430 --> 00:27:33.410
no one knows

00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:34.800
when they will go to war.

00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:38.150
These things are weird.

00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:41.670
It's as if someone

00:27:42.110 --> 00:27:43.700
is controlling Xichuan.

00:27:45.110 --> 00:27:46.110
No matter how chaotic Xichuan is,

00:27:46.630 --> 00:27:47.980
it's my territory.

00:27:49.870 --> 00:27:52.050
It doesn't feel good

00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:54.520
that Xichuan is out of my control.

00:27:57.320 --> 00:27:58.580
Lord Wen, what do you want to do?

00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:01.280
Fu Sheng, you're a good physician.

00:28:01.910 --> 00:28:03.910
When people are sick, they can be cured.

00:28:04.910 --> 00:28:06.480
If the city is sick,

00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:08.430
I think it can be cured, too.

00:28:13.910 --> 00:28:14.910
Diseases have roots.

00:28:15.870 --> 00:28:16.850
No matter how deep they hide,

00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:19.480
they are dangerous.

00:28:21.670 --> 00:28:23.240
I'll leave it to you.

00:28:25.190 --> 00:28:25.830
I'll do my best.

00:28:27.430 --> 00:28:28.040
Waiter.

00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:31.160
You've been working for me

00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:32.870
for a while, huh?

00:28:33.190 --> 00:28:34.560
It's been more than two years, master.

00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:36.830
You've

00:28:37.430 --> 00:28:39.150
worked hard

00:28:39.430 --> 00:28:40.280
for the past two years.

00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:42.110
All right.

00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:44.000
Pack your things

00:28:44.190 --> 00:28:44.630
and leave.

00:28:44.910 --> 00:28:45.240
Okay.

00:28:45.910 --> 00:28:46.390
Master.

00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:47.910
You didn't give me my salary

00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:49.350
for the last few years.

00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:50.240
Salary?

00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:52.390
I'm broke

00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:54.040
because of the warehouse fire.

00:28:54.190 --> 00:28:54.960
I have no money to pay you.

00:28:55.110 --> 00:28:55.430
Get out of here.

00:28:56.830 --> 00:28:57.390
Master.

00:28:57.630 --> 00:28:58.560
You have a big business.

00:28:58.560 --> 00:28:59.430
This is just a branch.

00:28:59.590 --> 00:29:00.720
Can't you pay my salary?

00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:01.150
Get out.

00:29:01.670 --> 00:29:03.190
Master, I'm begging you.

00:29:03.250 --> 00:29:04.380
- Please give me my salary - Get out.

00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:05.500
Master.

00:29:06.350 --> 00:29:07.040
Sir.

00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:08.520
What can I do for you?

00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:10.620
Your warehouse was on fire yesterday, right?

00:29:11.190 --> 00:29:12.130
May I ask

00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:13.220
who you are?

00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:14.560
Cut the nonsense.

00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:16.040
I'm from the Lord's Mansion.

00:29:17.390 --> 00:29:18.720
I suspect your warehouse fire

00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:20.630
had something to do with Lei Juekun's death.

00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:21.670
What?

00:29:22.830 --> 00:29:24.040
What makes you think so?

00:29:24.390 --> 00:29:25.000
Save it

00:29:25.150 --> 00:29:26.320
for the Lord's Mansion.

00:29:26.590 --> 00:29:26.910
I...

00:29:26.910 --> 00:29:27.590
Take me to the warehouse.

00:29:27.830 --> 00:29:28.240
I...

00:29:28.590 --> 00:29:29.240
Hurry.

00:29:30.430 --> 00:29:30.960
This way.

00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:34.390
This way.

00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:43.750
Here it is.

00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:49.810
The warehouse fire

00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:51.960
was an accident.

00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:54.840
The weather is dry.

00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:57.310
Maybe a wildfire set some cloth on fire.

00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:11.880
What's this?

00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:14.310
It's a gold frame glass mirror.

00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:15.720
I got it a few days ago.

00:30:16.270 --> 00:30:17.070
It's a rare treasure.

00:30:17.310 --> 00:30:18.480
A merchant

00:30:18.920 --> 00:30:19.920
was robbed by bandits.

00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:21.720
It was the only thing he left.

00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:24.240
He pawned it

00:30:24.510 --> 00:30:25.310
for travelling expenses.

00:30:31.310 --> 00:30:31.830
Master.

00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:33.350
Someone is looking for you.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:38.480
Go.

00:30:38.830 --> 00:30:39.940
This place is ruined.

00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:41.110
There's nothing left here.

00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:42.510
All right.

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:44.310
Excuse me.

00:31:01.570 --> 00:31:02.270
Stop.

00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:07.420
[Fuquan Pawn Shop]

00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:11.030
Stop.

00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:39.790
Xiaolong.

00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:41.680
Why are you back?

00:31:42.590 --> 00:31:43.480
How is it going?

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:46.780
The glass mirror is good.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:48.590
All the ledgers are gone.

00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:50.440
Good job.

00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:52.720
Gu Tian went to the pawn shop

00:31:52.830 --> 00:31:53.920
to investigate the fire in the name of the Lord's Mansion.

00:31:54.510 --> 00:31:55.510
He found this glass mirror.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:57.240
I was worried he'd notice something wrong.

00:31:57.510 --> 00:31:58.110
So I stole it.

00:31:58.400 --> 00:31:59.510
He chased me for a few blocks.

00:32:00.790 --> 00:32:01.440
You are spotted.

00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:03.350
Xiaolong, don't worry.

00:32:03.510 --> 00:32:04.510
I got rid of him.

00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:06.750
You two, go out and have a look.

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:07.310
Yes.

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:16.200
Physician Fu, it's time to eat.

00:32:17.510 --> 00:32:18.800
Gu Tian hasn't come back.

00:32:19.030 --> 00:32:19.590
You eat first.

00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:21.450
No way.

00:32:21.790 --> 00:32:22.960
Let's wait for him.

00:32:23.830 --> 00:32:25.180
If you're hungry, eat first.

00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:25.920
Don't worry.

00:32:27.590 --> 00:32:28.000
I'm starving.

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:28.830
- I'm starving. - Gu is back.

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:29.480
I'm starving.

00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:31.110
You're finally back. We've been waiting for you.

00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:32.240
Let's eat.

00:32:34.830 --> 00:32:35.400
I'm starving.

00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:37.750
Where have you been?

00:32:40.030 --> 00:32:41.250
The Fuquan Pawn Shop

00:32:41.830 --> 00:32:43.680
Feng Qianli took us to the other day

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:44.680
caught fire yesterday.

00:32:45.310 --> 00:32:46.200
The pawn shop caught fire.

00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:48.400
They probably wanted

00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:49.880
to destroy the ledgers we had seen.

00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:52.640
There is nothing left.

00:32:54.110 --> 00:32:55.880
The owner said the cause of the fire was dry weather.

00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:57.790
But I found something there.

00:32:59.110 --> 00:33:01.880
It's a glass mirror. A merchant pawned it for travelling expenses.

00:33:02.310 --> 00:33:04.350
It gathers heat in the sun.

00:33:04.830 --> 00:33:05.400
I guess

00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:06.590
it was used to start the fire.

00:33:07.030 --> 00:33:09.000
The fire was intentional.

00:33:09.270 --> 00:33:09.750
Where's the mirror?

00:33:11.510 --> 00:33:12.550
When I wasn't looking,

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:13.790
a guy stole it.

00:33:17.270 --> 00:33:18.720
It's weird.

00:33:20.590 --> 00:33:22.200
Xubu Huai died of a lightning strike.

00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:24.660
The groom has also got off the carriage.

00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:26.920
Hua Lei died of falling from a horse.

00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:29.570
That alley has a secret.

00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:32.530
Lei Juekun died of bloating.

00:33:33.070 --> 00:33:35.640
Someone knew that he ate dog meat at noon.

00:33:36.790 --> 00:33:38.480
He only needed

00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:40.030
to be careful

00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:42.960
to kill them without anyone noticing.

00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:45.960
Why did he do that?

00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:48.400
What can he get out of this?

00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:51.030
Anyway,

00:33:51.270 --> 00:33:52.270
we need to get to the truth quickly.

00:33:52.750 --> 00:33:54.960
Maybe someday it will be our turn.

00:34:01.240 --> 00:34:01.880
Don't you eat it?

00:34:05.310 --> 00:34:06.070
Guys.

00:34:06.590 --> 00:34:07.440
What do you think?

00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:10.360
I think we have a good life.

00:34:11.230 --> 00:34:12.380
He wanted to say

00:34:12.590 --> 00:34:13.810
that we had lived a dangerous life

00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:15.550
all these years.

00:34:16.110 --> 00:34:16.670
It's not easy

00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:18.360
for us to live

00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:19.510
a stable life.

00:34:20.030 --> 00:34:20.840
Yeah.

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:22.840
You're right.

00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:26.780
There's a storyteller

00:34:26.920 --> 00:34:28.230
who's jinxing our master.

00:34:29.230 --> 00:34:31.230
If something happens to him,

00:34:31.230 --> 00:34:32.510
we'll have to live a poor life again.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:35.000
We have to stop him.

00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:37.480
He wanted to say

00:34:38.230 --> 00:34:41.800
that our master would be safe

00:34:42.230 --> 00:34:43.550
if we silenced Fang.

00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:45.280
Yeah.

00:34:48.030 --> 00:34:48.320
Wait.

00:34:48.510 --> 00:34:51.000
Is there anything else you'd like to say?

00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:52.590
Okay.

00:34:53.110 --> 00:34:54.400
If so,

00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:55.590
we'll do what he said.

00:34:55.880 --> 00:34:56.150
Okay.

00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:57.280
Let's go to the Inviting Moon House tomorrow

00:34:57.710 --> 00:34:59.070
and silence Fang.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:00.510
But

00:35:01.070 --> 00:35:02.280
if we screw up,

00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:03.230
he's the one to blame.

00:35:03.510 --> 00:35:04.400
Yeah.

00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:05.280
Wait. No, brother.

00:35:05.400 --> 00:35:06.110
It's interesting.

00:35:06.110 --> 00:35:06.550
Go.

00:35:11.290 --> 00:35:12.480
Come to our house for a drink.

00:35:15.690 --> 00:35:16.620
Here we go.

00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:17.580
Here.

00:35:18.130 --> 00:35:18.660
Here.

00:35:21.230 --> 00:35:21.670
Brother.

00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:24.280
Does he dare to come today?

00:35:24.670 --> 00:35:25.800
If he comes, we'll teach him a lesson.

00:35:26.510 --> 00:35:27.110
It was his fault

00:35:27.710 --> 00:35:30.000
that the girl from Ma Gang grabbed me

00:35:30.070 --> 00:35:31.360
and interrogated me for days.

00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:34.400
If you want to teach him a lesson, you should come a few days earlier.

What do you know?

00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:40.760
I'm kind.

00:35:41.110 --> 00:35:42.150
All right. You're kind.

00:35:44.230 --> 00:35:44.920
Here he comes.

00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:45.880
Bro, hit him.

00:35:46.150 --> 00:35:46.760
Go.

00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:53.400
- Good! - Good!

00:35:53.670 --> 00:35:54.190
Good.

00:35:55.840 --> 00:35:58.510
Thank you for coming all the way

00:35:58.510 --> 00:36:00.550
to listen to my story.

00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:03.800

Get away.

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:18.550
Hero, what's the matter?

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:19.960
Ask yourself.

00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:21.700
You're a jinx.

00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:23.190
You got some heroes

00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:24.710
in the city killed.

00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:25.680
I'm innocent.

00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:27.440
You must have misunderstood me.

00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:28.960
Shut up.

00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:30.000
Guys.

00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:30.630
Yes.

00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:32.320
Take away his things.

00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:33.000
No.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:34.550
Hero.

00:36:34.670 --> 00:36:36.000
Those are my tools

00:36:36.190 --> 00:36:38.630
for making a living.

00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:39.360
Let go.

00:36:40.070 --> 00:36:41.230
Screw you.

00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:43.440
Go.

00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:48.480
I don't talk about the past, only the present.

00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:53.030
I'll praise the Three Heroes of Xichuan.

00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:57.030
Each of them is a hero.

00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:10.230
Shut up.

00:37:10.590 --> 00:37:11.920
You cursed us.

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:14.960
I'll kill you.

00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:15.510
Stop.

00:37:18.060 --> 00:37:18.840
The Young Mistress is here.

00:37:19.100 --> 00:37:20.060
Young Mistress.

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:22.550
Leader.

00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:23.710
What's wrong with you?

00:37:24.070 --> 00:37:25.360
How dare you bully him?

00:37:28.230 --> 00:37:28.840
Leave here.

00:37:29.190 --> 00:37:30.110
Don't disturb us.

00:37:31.110 --> 00:37:31.840
Go.

00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:35.280
Good thing I didn't go up.

00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:36.760
Look how miserable they are.

00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:38.110
Will they die?

00:37:39.190 --> 00:37:40.400
They made a scene.

00:37:41.070 --> 00:37:42.840
They will die.

00:37:45.190 --> 00:37:46.710
Will the three of them die tonight?

00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:49.630
If they die,

00:37:51.670 --> 00:37:54.440
I'll never

00:37:54.440 --> 00:37:56.590
clear my name.

00:38:04.190 --> 00:38:04.800
What do we do now?

00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:06.710
If we want to find out the relationship

00:38:06.710 --> 00:38:08.030
between the storyteller and the murderer,

00:38:09.510 --> 00:38:10.190
we should keep an eye

00:38:11.630 --> 00:38:12.770
on Fang Zhiyuan

00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:13.440
and your three men.

00:38:15.680 --> 00:38:17.130
We have to split into two groups.

00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:20.360
Miss Tuoba and I know martial arts.

00:38:20.650 --> 00:38:22.590
I'll go with Fu Sheng.

00:38:22.670 --> 00:38:24.150
Miss Tuoba goes with Wen Jue.

00:38:24.630 --> 00:38:26.190
In this way, everyone is safe.

00:38:27.070 --> 00:38:27.590
No.

00:38:29.070 --> 00:38:29.840
I don't know her well.

00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:32.110
Then...

00:38:33.030 --> 00:38:34.440
Miss Tuoba goes with Fu Sheng.

00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:35.630
I'll protect the Young Mistress.

00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:36.510
All right?

00:38:36.630 --> 00:38:37.280
No.

How about this?

00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:41.070
I'll go with Fu Sheng.

You don't know martial arts.

What if you encounter the murderer?

00:38:47.630 --> 00:38:49.380
No one dares to hurt me in Xichuan.

00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:53.280
Miss Tuoba, what do you say?

00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:03.400
Nice.

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:04.880
Don't even think about it.

00:39:05.320 --> 00:39:06.110
Stay away from her.

00:39:06.670 --> 00:39:08.550
Do you like her?

00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:11.800
If you piss her off, she'll stab you.

00:39:12.190 --> 00:39:13.370
I'll have to stitch you up.

00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:14.030
Don't look for trouble.

00:39:35.110 --> 00:39:35.590

I'm scared.

00:39:48.440 --> 00:39:49.320
What do we do?

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:51.340
What do we do?

00:39:51.630 --> 00:39:53.170
Do I look like I know what to do?

00:39:57.590 --> 00:39:58.960
Let's hide away.

00:39:59.110 --> 00:39:59.840
Let's find an open space

00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:01.000
to stay a night.

00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:02.690
Good idea.

00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:04.000
An open space has a good view.

00:40:04.230 --> 00:40:05.400
No one can hide there.

00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:06.710
If someone approaches us,

00:40:07.070 --> 00:40:08.190
we can run.

00:40:11.630 --> 00:40:12.960
Good for you.

00:40:14.840 --> 00:40:17.150
We'll light a bonfire,

hold a girl,

00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:20.280
and drink some wine.

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:23.220

Let's not cook.

00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:39.630
Let's go to the restaurant across the street.

It's up to you.

I'll eat this.

00:41:05.320 --> 00:41:05.880
Fried eggs?

00:41:06.230 --> 00:41:07.880
Don't touch things you don't know.

00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:22.070
No one can poison raw eggs.

00:41:22.440 --> 00:41:22.800
