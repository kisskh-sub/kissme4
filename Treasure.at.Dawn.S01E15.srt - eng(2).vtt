00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:20.800
There was a stab wound on the body,

00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:21.960
but there was no blood

00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:22.830
and scorched ash

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:24.040
inside the wound,

00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:25.960
so this was caused after his death, which is consistent

00:09:26.510 --> 00:09:29.350
with what the Chamber of Commerce fighter who found the deceased said.

00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:30.920
The autopsy results show

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:32.470
that his real cause of death

00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:33.960
was a lightning strike.

00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:35.040
Nonsense.

00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:36.590

to be struck by lightning.

00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:15.730

The post-mortem examiner has completed the autopsy.

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:03.440
Xubu Huai was killed by lightning,

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:06.080
but Che is being unreasonable.

00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:07.750
Lord Wen.

00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:10.960
This time, Ma Gang's dead.

00:11:11.510 --> 00:11:13.470
You can't send us away

00:11:13.470 --> 00:11:14.960
just by talking.

00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:17.110
Without an explanation

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:18.960
about this incident today,

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:21.870
my knife is going to be stained with blood.

00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:24.160
So what explanation do you want?

00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:26.280
Xubu Huai is dead,

00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:28.680
but his family has to live.

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:30.080
How about this?

00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:31.710
The Chamber of Commerce gives us a 30% profit.

00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:33.440
I'll send the rest

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:36.110
to Xubu Huai's mother.

00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:37.160
30%?

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:39.830
Maybe it's better to just rob.

00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:43.160
Good idea.

00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:46.700
Mr. Che.

00:11:47.210 --> 00:11:48.770
I will have this case investigated thoroughly,

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:50.720
and you will get results,

00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:54.560
but if you

00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:57.590
use the death of your man as an excuse

00:11:57.590 --> 00:11:59.160
to enrich yourself,

00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:04.990
your other men will be disappointed, won't they?

00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:06.710
Tuoba Ruo.

00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:08.710
Yes.

00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:14.350
She never worries me.

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:15.200
Good.

00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:16.510
Che.

00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:18.920
Good luck in finding the culprit.

00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:25.630
Don't mess it up.

00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:29.710
Let's go.

No one can touch him until the investigation is over.

Bandits are rampant in Xichuan.

No.

Mr. Hua.

Has my mother been to a physician about her eyes?

00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:45.440
What did the physician say?

00:13:45.710 --> 00:13:46.830
Is her eye disease curable?

Am I your servant?

or a doomsayer?

00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:03.400
Yesterday, you finished the story of Xubu Huai,

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:04.800
and he died.

00:14:05.630 --> 00:14:06.960
You are now talking about Hua Lei,

00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:09.160

Speaking of Hua Lei,

00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:20.510
he was a fierce fighter

00:14:20.750 --> 00:14:22.280
and especially good at catching thieves.

why Hua Lei

00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:39.040
likes catching thieves so much.

00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:40.710
That's interesting.

00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:42.680
Hua Lei is not interested

00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:44.990
in power or official positions.

00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:46.750
He only

I was so anxious to learn that my mother

had suddenly contracted an eye disease

00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:53.870
and lost her sight, but there was nothing I could do.

00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:55.470
Fortunately, you helped me

00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:57.160
and brought the money to my mother

00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:58.280
to hire a physician for her,

00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:00.510

you not only didn't inform me

00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:16.540
but also played bully to my subordinates.

00:27:18.310 --> 00:27:19.520
That's not necessarily true.

00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:27.320
You really call them over?

00:27:28.870 --> 00:27:30.560
I just wanted to scare her.

00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:32.390
I haven't had a chance to call them yet.

00:27:32.790 --> 00:27:33.870
Miss Tuoba.

00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:35.630
For Fu Sheng's sake,

00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:38.080
[Jibei Chamber of Commerce]
you and your men can go now.

00:27:38.590 --> 00:27:39.680
That's not

00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:40.870
what the agreement says.

00:27:41.150 --> 00:27:43.520
But you were the first to break it.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:44.800
What do you mean?

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:47.080
Hua Lei is dead.

00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:13.470
Bloody handprints again.

00:28:14.070 --> 00:28:15.000
Let's stop the investigation.

00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:16.280
I'm getting scared.

00:28:16.790 --> 00:28:19.530
This wound is messy.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:21.180
The murderer didn't know how to apply force.

00:28:21.390 --> 00:28:22.840
The murder weapon is not a good knife

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:25.560
and the murderer is not an expert.

00:28:27.070 --> 00:28:28.540
But the strange thing is

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:30.600
that Hua Lei didn't show any signs of resistance

00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:32.950
when his heart was removed.

00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:36.040
Was it done by a ghost?

00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:39.440
It's supposed to be a bad martial arts fighter

00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:43.190
who killed a famous general of the Jibei Chamber of Commerce.

00:28:43.630 --> 00:28:45.230
Was this done

00:28:45.390 --> 00:28:46.360
by the storyteller's ghost?

00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:47.280
Yes.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:49.280
Look. There's a ghost's handprint

00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:50.870
next to his chest.

00:28:51.150 --> 00:28:52.520
Little ghosts love to eat people's hearts.

00:28:53.150 --> 00:28:55.360
They must have dug it out.

00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:56.230
Get out of the way.

00:29:02.870 --> 00:29:04.090
Who did this?

00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:06.280
Ma Gang didn't do this.

00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:09.000
It should be Night Owl.

00:29:09.310 --> 00:29:10.150
Him?

00:29:11.790 --> 00:29:13.320
Hua Lei is strong in fighting.

00:29:13.550 --> 00:29:15.080
That thief is so cowardly.

00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:16.630
When he hears Hua Lei's name, he'll stay away from here,

00:29:17.150 --> 00:29:18.430
so how could he kill Hua Lei?

00:29:19.070 --> 00:29:19.840
Lord Wen.

00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:22.360
There must be a conspiracy.

00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:25.870
Chairman Li.

00:29:26.590 --> 00:29:28.150
I know you're skeptical,

00:29:28.830 --> 00:29:30.390
but don't be impatient, please.

00:29:31.150 --> 00:29:33.000
I will find out the truth for you.

00:29:33.550 --> 00:29:34.760
Someone in the Ma Gang is dead,

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:36.710
and the same goes for us.

00:29:37.070 --> 00:29:37.800
Lord Wen.

00:29:38.150 --> 00:29:40.150
I need an explanation.

00:29:40.350 --> 00:29:41.910
Chairman Li,

00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:43.470
please think of the big picture.

00:29:43.790 --> 00:29:44.520
Lord Wen.

00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:46.580
The Chamber of Commerce is my big picture.

00:29:47.150 --> 00:29:49.280
My subordinates are seeing if I can be a good leader.

00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:50.870
Now that I've said my piece,

00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:52.600
I'll take my leave.

00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:11.430
Mr. Gu.

00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:14.280
Three groups of Ma Gang's swordsmen just walked past.

00:30:14.590 --> 00:30:15.760
Based on their direction,

00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:17.760
they seem to be heading for the Jibei Chamber of Commerce.

00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:19.930
In that case,

00:30:20.150 --> 00:30:22.280
20 teams have gone there at noon.

00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:24.360
This time,

00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:25.600
Ma Gang has basically used

00:30:25.790 --> 00:30:26.800
all their living men.

00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:30.230
Something big is about to happen.

00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:32.230
Gu Tian.

00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:36.320
Yingying.

00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:41.000
It's so chaotic out there,

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:42.020
but why did you go out?

00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:43.920
I heard that the two sides

00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:45.910
are about to clash over the recent murder,

00:30:46.150 --> 00:30:48.470
and Fu Sheng is the city lord's clerk

00:30:48.590 --> 00:30:49.840
in charge of investigating the case.

00:30:50.550 --> 00:30:52.520
I thought Hearsay-capturing Pavilion

00:30:52.630 --> 00:30:54.120
might be able to help,

00:30:54.150 --> 00:30:54.910
so I came over.

00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:56.710
Then you shouldn't go out either.

00:30:57.150 --> 00:30:58.280
It's too dangerous out there.

00:30:58.920 --> 00:31:00.230
If something like this happens again,

00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:02.040
ask Feng Qianli to let me know,

00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:02.950
and then I'll come to you.

00:31:03.870 --> 00:31:04.560
OK.

00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:07.770
How's the investigation going?

00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:10.950
I heard Hua Lei was killed by Night Owl.

00:31:11.150 --> 00:31:11.870
Yes.

00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:13.840
Night Owl

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:15.430
is like a mouse

00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:16.600
that goes around making holes.

00:31:17.790 --> 00:31:19.470
No one knows where he's hiding.

00:31:22.350 --> 00:31:23.150
Leave it to me.

00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:25.440
There's no one in Xichuan

00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:27.950
that the Hearsay-capturing Pavilion can't find.

00:31:30.790 --> 00:31:31.560
Right.

That's how my master taught me.

Of course not.

00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:24.190
He was killed because he was greedy for money.

00:40:25.590 --> 00:40:28.000
I just cut out his heart.
