Viewer discretion is advised.

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.050
I’d like to put Mr. Peach’s
Winter Collection contract on hold.

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.000
Wiwid is the guy
you had a problem with, isn’t he?

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:22.300
What a freaking loser.

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:23.560
He acts like he’s so big and powerful.

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.650
While true love is really hard to find,

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:28.200
it doesn’t mean it can’t be found.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.230
Are you in love?

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:30.680
MISS YOU

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.500
You don’t have work tomorrow, right?

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:33.500
I’m going to Bang Krachao.

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:34.780
I can even go with you.

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:35.900
I’m free tomorrow.

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.380
I already booked a hotel,
so I don’t have to wake up early tomorrow.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:39.820
I only have a vacation home there.

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.890
Will that do?

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:41.800
Who are you?

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:43.500
You haven’t answered my question.

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.500
Is there any way
you could be mine only, Peachayarat?

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:25.760
Oh, shit!

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.570
Good morning, Mr. Peachayarat.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.150
Warm water at 37°C is ready.

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.250
Huh? What warm water?

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:38.650
Water between 30-40°C

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.500
is good for stimulating blood circulation.

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.650
It refreshes your body
without making your heart beat too fast.

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:46.900
I just need a quick shower.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:48.750
A quick shower?

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:51.300
Here, we believe

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:54.100
a new morning should start perfectly.

00:01:54.370 --> 00:02:00.700
Bathing for about five minutes helps
your body transition from rest to energy.

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.980
Everything is ready for you,
Mr. Peachayarat.

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.700
When he said his bathroom was the size
of my house, I thought he was joking.

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:21.400
Turns out it’s true.

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.610
Oh.

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.800
May I have some privacy?

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:34.300
Very well, if you need anything,
please ring the bell to let us know.

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:53.980
The bathroom doors are even made of glass.

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:02.600
Is this real?

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.790
A life like Gorya from F4 really exists?

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:35.000
This is even beyond Gorya, Peach!

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:46.950
The clothes are ready.

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:53.650
I have my own clothes.

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:54.800
They’re in the car.

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:02.900
Breakfast will be ready in 10 minutes.

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:13.400
The guys over there said that
Master has arrived in Hong Kong.

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:15.790
But Madam is still here.

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.400
She said she’s not done
with her errands in Thailand yet.

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.840
Who exactly told you that?

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:30.900
You’re good at everything,
except this, Mok.

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:33.210
Boss.

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:34.780
No more of this!

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.250
Staying over? I can live with it.

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.300
But troubling others like this? I’m done.

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:45.409
Your working location is only
15 minutes from here.

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:47.659
You still have an hour and a half
for breakfast.

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:49.850
But if you need to get ready,

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:52.180
I’ve already had your
breakfast prepared in the car.

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:52.780
Stop!

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:00.730
What you all are doing is not normal.

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:01.600
Like what?

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:05.450
Like waking up and troubling them.

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:08.000
Not to mention the water temperature
and the clothes.

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:09.300
It’s not normal.

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:10.830
It’s normal.

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:18.300
What about the violin in the bathroom?

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:20.100
Are you saying that’s normal too?

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:21.850
That’s not normal.

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:23.830
See?

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:27.100
I bathed in muddy canal water
during my military reserve training.

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:29.300
Just one shake of my clothes
and they were considered neat.

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:32.130
It’s not like that.

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:36.550
This is a vacation home
built for relaxation.

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:39.700
The care and attention here
is more special than anywhere else.

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:42.850
Let’s talk outside.

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:46.230
Can’t we talk here
so you can eat at the same time?

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:48.100
No.

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:49.850
If you don’t eat your meal on time,

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:51.840
you might get a stomachache.

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:53.470
That’s fine. I can just skip it.

00:06:53.659 --> 00:06:55.180
But you’re under my care.

00:06:55.659 --> 00:06:59.000
Your health is important,
and I need to take care of it too.

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:16.900
I’m already full.

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:18.450
Can we go now?

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:30.240
It was dark last night,

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.300
so I didn’t realize
your house was this big.

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:36.130
You want me to knock it down
and make it smaller?

00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:38.850
Get a grip, Mr. Thee!

00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:43.180
Seriously, do you really need
that many people when you take a bath?

00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:50.370
That’s not normal to me,

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:53.980
because everything they do,
I can do myself.

00:07:54.190 --> 00:07:55.060
I don’t want to bother them.

00:07:55.190 --> 00:07:56.600
But it’s their job.

00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:04.200
We got here at almost 2 a.m. last night.

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:06.710
If I’d known staying here
for just a few hours

00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:08.100
would inconvenience them this much,

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:10.100
I would’ve stayed at the hotel I booked.

00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:13.600
I just…

00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:16.600
want to take care of you as best as I can.

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:18.450
That’s all.

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:25.130
I’m not…

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:31.270
Let’s try this again.

00:08:35.490 --> 00:08:38.200
We grew up differently.

00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:41.700
I’m not used to having
so many people wait on me.

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:47.030
Then, shall we open up

00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:48.950
and learn about each other?

00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:56.300
Honestly, I understand them
more than I understand you.

00:08:58.490 --> 00:08:59.150
Why is that?

00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:07.300
I’m also someone who works for a living.

00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:12.970
Your job is to give orders.

00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:17.600
Your men and I are the ones taking orders.

00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:21.150
Do you see the difference?

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:28.200
How do you know

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:31.600
I don’t have to take orders too?

00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:34.770
Mr. Thee.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:38.640
This is a job I can’t quit.

00:09:39.250 --> 00:09:40.450
I can’t even run away from it.

00:09:57.970 --> 00:09:59.530
What you’re doing is not wrong

00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:02.250
and I’m not upset.

00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:08.650
It’s good of you to want to
take care of someone.

00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:14.350
I mean it.

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:21.850
I’m just a little shocked by
how rich you are.

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:28.150
When you said my house was only
a little bigger than your bathroom,

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:29.300
I thought you were being sarcastic.

00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:30.950
Who would’ve thought it was true?

00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:35.400
Actually, I have another house
that’s a little smaller than this one,

00:10:37.010 --> 00:10:38.120
if you’re scared of big spaces.

00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:41.200
Hey, are you crazy?

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:43.180
I’ve only heard of people
being scared of tight spaces.

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:48.600
Your house is really pretty, though.

00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:52.400
So is the garden. I like it.

00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:56.380
Next time, you can bring
your turtle shell and tap it here.

00:10:57.880 --> 00:10:59.070
You can come by any time you want.

00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:01.000
Turtle shell?

00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:06.200
Your turtle shell
that makes an echoing sound.

00:11:08.510 --> 00:11:09.800
That’s called a hand pan.

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:12.100
It’s a musical instrument,
not a turtle shell.

00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:14.900
It’s a musical instrument?

00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:19.050
I never had time to learn music.

00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:28.050
You’re free today, right?

00:11:28.690 --> 00:11:29.900
I’ll take you to do something fun.

00:11:32.610 --> 00:11:35.050
What is it that you’re talking about?

00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:38.900
Well, I’ve learned about
your extravagant life.

00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:43.400
It’s your turn to learn about
my ordinary one.

00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:52.260
Come on. I don’t want to be late for work.

00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:55.800
Please go to that gazebo
all the way in the back, team.

00:11:57.030 --> 00:11:58.400
Turn right if you need to go
to the bathroom.

00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:04.130
Oh, hey, Peach! There you are!

00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:05.100
Hi, In.

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:07.000
Wow, you brought an assistant?

00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:08.700
I thought you were going with
natural lighting.

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:12.600
And didn’t the coordinator tell you
I had a very limited budget?

00:12:13.070 --> 00:12:15.320
They did mention it,
but this is my intern.

00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:17.230
Just lunch will do, right?

00:12:17.630 --> 00:12:18.400
Are you sure?

00:12:18.650 --> 00:12:20.050
Everyone who works should get paid.

00:12:20.350 --> 00:12:22.000
Does he need any support?

00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:23.980
I can try shifting the budget around
to pay him.

00:12:24.770 --> 00:12:25.500
Don’t worry.

00:12:26.060 --> 00:12:27.170
Please just give him a boxed lunch.

00:12:27.450 --> 00:12:28.150
He’s not fussy.

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:31.140
You’re not fussy?

00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:35.980
I’m going to check the set.

00:12:36.830 --> 00:12:37.600
Sure.

00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:40.470
Turn left and head to the gazebo
in the back.

00:12:41.270 --> 00:12:41.800
Let’s go.

00:12:45.270 --> 00:12:47.250
The bathroom will be on your right
if you need it.

00:12:48.570 --> 00:12:49.730
Team, Peach is here!

00:13:05.530 --> 00:13:06.100
It’s hot.

00:13:12.650 --> 00:13:15.050
Please go back to the cafe area, sir.

00:13:15.810 --> 00:13:17.000
This is a filming set.

00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:18.100
No outsiders allowed.

00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:22.950
You can go.

00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:26.020
And tell everyone to stay away from me.

00:13:34.490 --> 00:13:35.050
Yes, Boss.

00:13:41.870 --> 00:13:43.300
We’re just getting started.

00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:49.400
Why didn’t you choose
a better place to work?

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:54.530
What kind of place
would be better for you?

00:13:58.400 --> 00:13:59.470
An air-conditioned studio,

00:14:01.250 --> 00:14:02.170
like the one at ARSENI.

00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:05.750
Give me the bag.

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:21.370
Can you go over there
so I can test the lighting?

00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:26.000
Me?

00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:31.300
Did you forget that you’re supposed to
follow my orders today?

00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:33.580
Right, intern?

00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:47.500
Hey, take off your glasses.

00:14:55.860 --> 00:14:56.750
Give me a smile.

00:14:57.400 --> 00:14:58.300
The lighting is perfect right now.

00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:05.900
Today’s job is to promote
the cafe to couples.

00:15:06.910 --> 00:15:08.230
That smile doesn’t match the concept.

00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:12.730
I don’t know how to do it.

00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:17.350
When you look at someone you love,

00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:19.400
what kind of eyes
do you usually give them?

00:15:27.610 --> 00:15:29.150
The eyes I give someone I love?

00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:16.500
Did I do it right?

00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:19.180
You asked for the eyes
meant for someone I love.

00:16:20.530 --> 00:16:21.430
Is this it?

00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:25.900
Who were you imagining when we shot this?

00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:29.300
I didn’t have to imagine anything.

00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:32.650
You’re that good, huh?

00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:39.910
I just…

00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:53.860

00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:57.190

00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:30.500
All I had to do was recall

00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:36.190
the feeling of meeting those eyes

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:39.300
and look through the lens.

00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:52.210
We have a problem, Peach!

00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:54.850
The model guy fell down the stairs!

00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:55.590
What?

00:18:58.990 --> 00:18:59.740
Oh, shit.

00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:04.790
But don’t worry, I’ve asked the crew
to look for a handsome young man

00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:17.400
who’s radiant

00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:28.300
and…charming.

00:19:39.790 --> 00:19:40.500
Not a chance.

00:19:52.340 --> 00:19:53.990
If Dad sees my face in the magazine,

00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:55.800
not only will I get in trouble,

00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:57.580
but everyone on set, including you,

00:19:58.240 --> 00:19:59.460
will need to start looking for a new job.

00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:03.900
Your only condition is
to not show your face, right?

00:20:06.820 --> 00:20:07.800
Please get into position, intern.

00:20:11.550 --> 00:20:14.000
Alright, hold the coffee a bit higher.

00:20:14.530 --> 00:20:17.300
Turn a little more toward the back,
so your face can’t be seen.

00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:20.100
Uh… Can you two move closer?

00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:22.250
Make it look like you’re a couple.

00:20:24.210 --> 00:20:25.760
Okay. One, two, three.

00:20:26.290 --> 00:20:27.230
Touch your cups together.

00:20:27.650 --> 00:20:29.100
You can turn the other way.

00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:30.740
Yes, that’s right.

00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:33.030
Okay. One, two, three.

00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:34.060
Awesome.

00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:36.490
Honestly, even without seeing
the guy model’s face,

00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:38.800
-they still look like a real couple.
-Five more shots with this pose.

00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:40.090
Great. That’s it.

00:20:40.110 --> 00:20:42.780
Nice and sweet. Wow!

00:20:43.130 --> 00:20:43.700
Okay.

00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:44.850
I think we’re good to go.

00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:47.630
Thank you so much for today, Peach.

00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:52.350
Anyway, we worked together all day,
but I still don’t know your name.

00:20:52.950 --> 00:20:53.700
You don’t need to know.

00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:57.580
Oh, you’re mysterious, huh?

00:20:57.870 --> 00:21:00.090
You also didn’t let your face be captured
during the photoshoot.

00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:02.500
Honestly, if it weren’t for your skills,

00:21:02.610 --> 00:21:06.690
I’m not sure how photos without
the model’s face would even work, Peach.

00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:10.900
If everything’s good, please excuse us.

00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:12.200
Alright.

00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:13.500
Hold on!

00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:15.400
I almost forgot.

00:21:15.910 --> 00:21:17.200
Here’s a small token of appreciation.

00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:18.350
Thanks for helping out.

00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:27.700
Thank you so much.

00:21:28.430 --> 00:21:28.910
No problem.

00:21:29.170 --> 00:21:30.130
Can we leave already?

00:21:33.790 --> 00:21:34.500
Please excuse us.

00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:36.100
Alright.

00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:40.700
(Isn’t he kinda weird?)

00:21:54.940 --> 00:21:56.200
You’re tired, intern?

00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:11.800
You’re feeling better now, right?

00:22:28.010 --> 00:22:29.640
Why are you smiling so sweetly
at the bottle?

00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:32.420
The one you should be smiling at is me.

00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:34.200
I helped you out at work.

00:22:40.850 --> 00:22:42.100
No, I’m smiling because of you.

00:22:50.930 --> 00:22:51.450
Here.

00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:54.700
A reward for your work.

00:22:55.260 --> 00:22:56.300
Maybe it’ll help you feel less tired.

00:23:04.790 --> 00:23:05.500
It’s a lot, right?

00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:10.600
A lot?

00:23:12.470 --> 00:23:14.770
This is probably just enough to buy the kind
of tissues used to wipe off my sweat today.

00:23:16.010 --> 00:23:18.150
5,000 just for tissues?

00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:24.590
Are your tissues made from
100-year olive trees or what?

00:23:30.810 --> 00:23:35.250
Let’s see what else you can do with
the 5,000 you’d spend on tissues.

00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:40.130
Can you handle riding that bike?

00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:43.400
It’s a little old.

00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:45.800
Push it out.

00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:47.600
And bite.

00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:49.400
Like this.

00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:53.510
Mmm.

00:23:55.310 --> 00:23:56.130
This is a gizzard.

00:23:59.510 --> 00:24:00.530
I think this is the best one.

00:24:03.010 --> 00:24:03.710
Come on.

00:24:04.050 --> 00:24:04.740
Stop it!

00:24:04.830 --> 00:24:05.300
Hey!

00:24:06.290 --> 00:24:06.930
Are you okay?

00:24:07.580 --> 00:24:08.300
I’m not used to this.

00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:11.120
Do you want some carrots?

00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:12.350
Hey!

00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:20.000
We had both savory and sweet
for just a few hundred baht today.

00:24:25.660 --> 00:24:26.130
Hmm?

00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:29.000
I love watching you focus on something.

00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:40.330
I’ve been meaning to ask

00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:42.970
about your tattoo.

00:24:47.740 --> 00:24:50.250
I got it when I received my first paycheck
as a photographer.

00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:53.300
It’s to remind myself
to stay focused at work

00:24:54.170 --> 00:24:55.700
and be mindful of everything I do.

00:24:57.560 --> 00:25:00.850
But honestly, I won’t get another tattoo.

00:25:01.380 --> 00:25:02.250
It hurt so bad.

00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:05.870
What about you?

00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:09.670
You’re not a mafia boss
without a tattoo, right?

00:25:11.410 --> 00:25:11.920
Mmm.

00:25:13.970 --> 00:25:16.200
But mine is not as meaningful as yours.

00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:23.670
It’s just a rule I have to follow.

00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:25.170
A rule again?

00:25:27.010 --> 00:25:28.730
Your life really doesn’t sound like fun.

00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:37.000
But you gave me so much fun today.

00:25:42.010 --> 00:25:43.300
The day’s not over yet.

00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:46.300
We still have plenty of money left.

00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:48.570
I’ll take you to do more fun things.

00:25:52.910 --> 00:25:53.430
Here.

00:25:55.620 --> 00:25:56.550
I’m watching my diet.

00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:10.160

MOMMY PLA’S HOMESTAY

Are we leaving yet?

00:27:36.820 --> 00:27:38.000
We’re staying here tonight.

What did you say?

00:27:41.410 --> 00:27:42.350
We still have a lot of money left.

00:27:44.060 --> 00:27:44.750
Hi, there.

00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:46.600
Welcome.

00:27:53.970 --> 00:27:54.460
Hi.

00:27:54.650 --> 00:27:55.410
Hi.

00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:56.600
Please come in.

00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:16.200
Oh, I forgot.

00:28:17.130 --> 00:28:19.750
Do I have to find a place
for Mr. Mok and your men too?

00:28:22.190 --> 00:28:23.300
I had everyone leave.

00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:27.250
Leave? Why?

00:28:31.450 --> 00:28:32.900
With you, I have nothing to fear.

00:28:54.620 --> 00:28:55.550
The pajamas—

00:28:56.350 --> 00:28:56.800
Oh.

00:28:58.050 --> 00:29:00.100
These are all the pajamas
I could prepare for you.

00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:05.700
And don’t worry about your clothes.

00:29:05.730 --> 00:29:06.600
I’ll wash them.

00:29:06.750 --> 00:29:08.300
Just leave them in front of your room,

00:29:08.970 --> 00:29:11.100
so you have nice clothes to wear
when you go home tomorrow.

00:29:11.230 --> 00:29:11.900
Thank you.

00:29:12.250 --> 00:29:13.180
Make yourself at home.

00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:24.700
Alright, go take a bath.

00:29:28.260 --> 00:29:29.100
Where’s the bathroom?

00:29:43.530 --> 00:29:45.000
Are you really going to make me
take a bath here?

00:29:46.410 --> 00:29:47.730
Well, yes.

00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:51.300
The locals wash themselves here too.

00:29:51.710 --> 00:29:53.400
Don’t worry.
No one’s going to sneak a look.

00:29:54.980 --> 00:29:55.900
There’s no tub.

00:29:56.600 --> 00:29:57.700
How am I supposed to take a bath?

00:29:59.170 --> 00:30:00.150
You stand.

00:30:00.690 --> 00:30:03.100
Here, take the bowl.

00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:07.700
Here’s the soap,

00:30:07.770 --> 00:30:10.070
and here’s the toothbrush and toothpaste.

00:30:19.740 --> 00:30:20.500
Where’s the mirror?

00:30:22.610 --> 00:30:24.100
Every time I wash my face
and brush my teeth,

00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:26.700
I need to look at my face in the mirror.

00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:30.700
You can look here.

00:30:31.710 --> 00:30:32.500
Are you crazy?

00:30:47.610 --> 00:30:48.550
I’ll wait upstairs.

00:30:50.120 --> 00:30:54.350
You can…brush your teeth
and look at yourself in the water.

00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:57.250
Or do I have to brush your teeth for you?

00:31:03.690 --> 00:31:04.300
Will you?

00:31:15.610 --> 00:31:16.500
Are you joking?

00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:19.550
I never joke, do I?

00:31:33.330 --> 00:31:34.300
Are my teeth white?

00:31:38.010 --> 00:31:39.350
Well, yeah.

00:32:02.430 --> 00:32:02.900
Hey!

00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:22.400
This is beyond embarrassing.

00:32:23.450 --> 00:32:25.000
Theerakit Kian Lee,

00:32:25.780 --> 00:32:28.050
the owner of ARSENI,
who carries his gun everywhere,

00:32:28.550 --> 00:32:29.550
is afraid of cockroaches?

00:32:31.850 --> 00:32:33.700
Don’t worry. It’s gone.

00:33:02.060 --> 00:33:03.700
Your tattoo is pretty big.

00:33:08.650 --> 00:33:09.850
Did it hurt a lot when you got it?

00:33:16.620 --> 00:33:17.290
Yeah, it hurt.

00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:22.500
But I’m so used to the pain
that I didn’t feel anything anymore.

00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:42.350
Pain is something to overcome,

00:33:44.610 --> 00:33:45.700
not something to get used to.

00:33:54.180 --> 00:33:55.180
I can’t get through it.

00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:07.170
Hi, young man.

00:34:07.970 --> 00:34:08.969
Are you looking for a room?

00:34:09.580 --> 00:34:11.070
Oh, no.

00:34:11.310 --> 00:34:12.400
I’m waiting for my friend,

00:34:14.130 --> 00:34:15.210
but I’m leaving soon.

00:34:16.130 --> 00:34:19.300
Well, you can do this to kill time.

00:34:19.550 --> 00:34:21.000
I have this for guests to enjoy.

00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:23.280
Oh, it’s alright.

00:34:23.409 --> 00:34:24.500
Just try it.

00:34:24.820 --> 00:34:25.699
I’m not charging extra.

00:34:27.850 --> 00:34:28.340
Alright then.

00:34:28.610 --> 00:34:29.300
Have fun.

00:34:47.889 --> 00:34:48.830
Do the pajamas fit?

00:34:53.530 --> 00:34:54.550
I’m not quite used to them yet.

00:35:03.030 --> 00:35:04.450
What do you usually wear to sleep?

00:35:08.460 --> 00:35:11.230
Everything I own has
Theerakit K. Lee engraved on it.

00:35:12.610 --> 00:35:13.400
Including your pajamas?

00:35:33.230 --> 00:35:33.970
What are you doing?

00:35:35.310 --> 00:35:35.970
Stay still.

I’ve already hung up the mosquito net.

00:36:31.180 --> 00:36:32.000

MOMMY PLA’S HOMESTAY

00:37:41.380 --> 00:37:42.030
I won.

00:37:50.660 --> 00:37:52.550
How was today? Did you enjoy it?

00:37:58.390 --> 00:37:59.300
I haven’t forgotten.

00:38:03.450 --> 00:38:10.200
You said that if we say 'sorry'
and 'thank you' too often,

00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:11.900
they stop being an honor.

00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:15.700
They stop being ‘honored.’

00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:24.350
But I really want to thank you for today.

00:38:28.610 --> 00:38:32.900
You make me unusually happy.

00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:38.000
Really?

00:38:43.750 --> 00:38:47.130
Thank you, Peach.

00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:57.650
You’re welcome, Mr. Thee.

00:39:23.270 --> 00:39:24.450
What’s the meaning of this?

00:39:25.060 --> 00:39:25.570
Hmm?

00:39:26.510 --> 00:39:27.100
What did I do?

00:39:27.390 --> 00:39:29.700
I remember I already told you

00:39:30.250 --> 00:39:34.150
Peach will be the photographer for
every collection of All Season’s One Word.

00:39:35.660 --> 00:39:41.240
Wait, but I thought only the Fall contract
has Mr. Peach’s name.

00:39:42.230 --> 00:39:44.700
If you’ve made a spoken promise,
that’s on you.

00:39:46.580 --> 00:39:49.000
I don’t know whether you and Peach
had a problem before,

00:39:49.690 --> 00:39:51.500
but you’re ruining my work.

00:39:54.940 --> 00:39:57.200
As the head of this project,

00:39:57.970 --> 00:40:01.180
I think my working style
and Peach’s don’t match.

00:40:02.130 --> 00:40:09.200
Besides, I think ARSENI brought me in
to be on the same level as you.

00:40:11.300 --> 00:40:12.400
What are you saying?

00:40:14.090 --> 00:40:17.450
You’d better spend your time
making sure your work is good, alright?

00:40:17.850 --> 00:40:19.370
Don’t interfere with someone else’s work.

00:40:20.060 --> 00:40:21.050
It’s unprofessional.

00:40:40.260 --> 00:40:41.850
You’ve dropped Peach home safely, right?

00:40:43.410 --> 00:40:44.880
Was he sulking because he missed me?

00:40:45.530 --> 00:40:45.970
Boss—

00:40:45.990 --> 00:40:47.350
If I hadn’t had to come back early
for the meeting,

00:40:48.130 --> 00:40:49.450
we wouldn’t have had to leave separately.

00:40:49.730 --> 00:40:50.230
Boss—

00:40:50.290 --> 00:40:54.530
Should I make up for my mistake
by buying that homestay

00:40:54.950 --> 00:40:56.450
and transferring the ownership to Peach?

00:40:58.670 --> 00:41:02.300
It’ll be a memento of our memories.

00:41:06.650 --> 00:41:07.750
There’s an urgent document, Boss.

00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:16.530
EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT

00:41:16.580 --> 00:41:17.400
What’s the meaning of this?

00:41:18.420 --> 00:41:19.630
Why is Peach not the photographer?

00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:22.000
The new project head asked to replace him.

00:41:23.210 --> 00:41:26.500
He suggested using a full-time
photographer to reduce costs.

00:41:28.010 --> 00:41:28.900
Who made that suggestion?

00:41:29.740 --> 00:41:30.850
The new team leader.

00:41:31.190 --> 00:41:31.900
His name is Wiwid.

00:41:34.500 --> 00:41:35.250
I’m not approving it.

00:41:36.180 --> 00:41:38.100
But we need a reason
to argue with Marketing.

00:41:39.010 --> 00:41:40.400
They’ve already signed the document.

00:41:46.790 --> 00:41:48.430
Wiwid was filed for child sexual abuse,

00:41:50.250 --> 00:41:53.650
but there wasn’t enough evidence
to prosecute him,

00:41:54.640 --> 00:41:56.400
so he was able to settle the case
by paying compensation.

00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:03.010
That’s enough to answer
Marketing’s questions, isn’t it?

00:42:04.060 --> 00:42:04.600
Yes.

00:42:06.950 --> 00:42:08.650
And as for him daring to mess with Peach,

00:42:09.950 --> 00:42:12.500
just firing him won’t be enough.

00:42:13.860 --> 00:42:14.900
What do you mean, Boss?

00:42:16.950 --> 00:42:19.450
I’ll just make sure he never dares
show his face to bother Peach again.

00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:23.200
Got it.

00:42:30.510 --> 00:42:32.500
I’ll still get to work on
the Spring Collection with Nuch.

00:42:32.690 --> 00:42:33.570
I’m not worried.

00:42:33.720 --> 00:42:35.200
But he played dirty.

00:42:35.570 --> 00:42:39.200
See? I told you he’d find a way
to kick you out.

00:42:40.890 --> 00:42:41.800
Calm down.

00:42:43.340 --> 00:42:45.370
You’re too calm.

00:42:47.410 --> 00:42:50.430
How am I calm? I’m very impatient.

00:42:51.670 --> 00:42:53.500
I can’t wait to take a 3-month vacation.

00:42:53.950 --> 00:42:55.400
This is not the time to joke.

00:42:56.190 --> 00:42:58.810
If I don’t have money for food,
will you take care of me, sister?

00:43:00.610 --> 00:43:01.370
Not funny.

00:43:03.160 --> 00:43:05.300
Okay, okay. Don’t scold me.

00:43:07.930 --> 00:43:10.700
Plub, I’m going to see Mother
next Saturday.

00:43:11.430 --> 00:43:12.200
Do you want to come with me?

00:43:13.310 --> 00:43:16.020
Sure. I'll go home this Friday.

00:43:16.040 --> 00:43:16.500
Plub!

00:43:16.990 --> 00:43:17.660
Plub! Plub!

00:43:17.870 --> 00:43:18.900
Plub!

00:43:19.870 --> 00:43:20.890
Peach, I have to go.

00:43:21.560 --> 00:43:22.110
(Hang up.)

00:43:23.180 --> 00:43:23.900
What’s going on?

00:43:24.520 --> 00:43:25.600
Wiwid is gone.

00:43:26.770 --> 00:43:27.240
Huh?

00:43:27.900 --> 00:43:28.690
What do you mean he’s gone?

00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:30.710
He’s gone, like really gone.

00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:32.750
Gone as if he never existed.

00:43:32.780 --> 00:43:33.500
Yeah.

00:43:34.520 --> 00:43:36.700
Nuch, Note, please speak slowly.

00:43:37.070 --> 00:43:37.770
I don’t understand.

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:41.120
Wiwid’s stuff is gone from his desk,
and he’s gone from ARSENI

00:43:41.140 --> 00:43:42.500
with no way to reach him.

00:43:42.540 --> 00:43:43.010
Yeah.

00:43:48.510 --> 00:43:50.200
I had no reason not to help you, did I?

00:43:52.270 --> 00:43:53.600
You’re my man.

00:43:55.170 --> 00:43:56.950
No one has the right to bully you.

00:43:58.870 --> 00:43:59.900
What did you do to Wiwid?

00:44:03.550 --> 00:44:04.780
It’s something you shouldn’t know about.

00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:06.650
Is he hurt?

00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:09.700
He treated you that badly,
and you’re still worried about him?

00:44:10.140 --> 00:44:13.050
Can I ask you not to hurt him?

00:44:13.660 --> 00:44:16.900
Getting fired without notice was enough.

00:44:21.780 --> 00:44:22.700
Do what Peach asked.

00:44:24.230 --> 00:44:24.770
Yes, Boss.

00:44:29.030 --> 00:44:33.350
I fired him not only because
he was a bad leader,

00:44:33.850 --> 00:44:37.800
but also because he didn’t even have
basic humanity.

00:44:44.100 --> 00:44:44.800
Mr. Thee.

00:45:03.890 --> 00:45:05.100
Are you going anywhere this weekend?

00:45:09.930 --> 00:45:11.600
I want to stay there with you again.

00:45:13.370 --> 00:45:16.300
I already have plans with my sister.

00:45:19.630 --> 00:45:21.020
Then invite your sister to join us.

00:45:21.310 --> 00:45:22.250
Are you crazy?

00:45:23.780 --> 00:45:25.800
If my sister finds out I’m close to…

00:45:28.460 --> 00:45:29.900
Mr. Theerakit Kian Lee,

00:45:30.520 --> 00:45:32.000
she’ll die of shock.

00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:33.050
But I—

00:45:33.220 --> 00:45:33.790
No.

00:45:35.170 --> 00:45:36.050
I really can’t make it.

00:45:38.120 --> 00:45:38.730
How about this?

00:45:39.930 --> 00:45:43.450
I’ll find somewhere new so we can
go together when we have time.

00:45:44.140 --> 00:45:45.050
Don’t worry.

00:45:45.660 --> 00:45:46.900
I’m free for the next three months anyway.

00:45:48.330 --> 00:45:49.000
How come?

00:45:49.830 --> 00:45:51.000
I already fired him.

00:45:55.500 --> 00:45:56.600
Did no one tell you?

00:46:00.690 --> 00:46:02.800
Before Wiwid fired me,

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:05.000
he had already signed a new photographer.

00:46:13.860 --> 00:46:14.380
Mok.

00:46:15.160 --> 00:46:15.710
Yes, Boss.

00:46:16.100 --> 00:46:16.600
Stop.

00:46:16.850 --> 00:46:18.510
Both of you stop. Don’t do anything yet.

00:46:18.670 --> 00:46:22.300
But all the contracts reviewed by Wiwid
are considered invalid.

00:46:23.830 --> 00:46:24.800
I understand,

00:46:25.600 --> 00:46:29.460
but Nuch said the new guy
already quit his previous job.

00:46:29.710 --> 00:46:32.550
If you fire him, he’ll be in a tough spot.

00:46:32.750 --> 00:46:33.580
You care about everyone in the world!

00:46:33.910 --> 00:46:34.790
You worry about everyone in the world!

00:46:35.890 --> 00:46:37.300
Are you the guardian of people’s peace?

00:46:38.170 --> 00:46:38.800
Money.

00:46:41.590 --> 00:46:43.810
Your money and other people's money
aren’t the same.

00:46:45.190 --> 00:46:48.230
Remember the 5,000
you were going to spend on tissues?

00:46:49.280 --> 00:46:50.900
Other people can do a lot with that money.

00:46:54.580 --> 00:46:57.300
Being unemployed
in this economy isn’t fun.

00:46:57.770 --> 00:46:59.200
But you were removed from the project.

00:47:00.410 --> 00:47:01.550
Isn’t that losing a job?

00:47:03.010 --> 00:47:03.900
It’s not the same.

00:47:04.350 --> 00:47:05.150
How is it not the same?

00:47:08.120 --> 00:47:11.400
It’s not the same because
I have you to treat me to meals.

00:47:19.350 --> 00:47:19.850
Mok.

00:47:21.170 --> 00:47:22.500
Have Peach removed from every project.

00:47:22.680 --> 00:47:23.120
Hey!

00:47:23.230 --> 00:47:23.960
Hold on!

00:47:25.220 --> 00:47:27.230
And make sure the name Peachayarat
is blacklisted.

00:47:28.020 --> 00:47:29.750
Make sure no one can hire him again.

00:47:30.060 --> 00:47:31.300
Hey, I was joking.

00:47:32.230 --> 00:47:32.890
Mr. Mok, I—

00:47:36.800 --> 00:47:38.000
Get a grip.

00:47:39.710 --> 00:47:42.700
From now on, I’ll take care of you.

00:47:44.850 --> 00:47:46.000
Mr. Mok, I was joking.

00:47:46.020 --> 00:47:47.300
Please don’t do that. I’m begging you.

00:47:47.580 --> 00:47:49.250
Please get a grip and wait.

00:47:52.340 --> 00:47:54.760
It’s just one collection.

00:47:55.440 --> 00:47:58.050
I already signed the Spring
and Summer collections with Nuch.

00:47:59.300 --> 00:48:01.120
Don’t worry.
We’ll be together for a long time.

00:48:05.030 --> 00:48:06.380
Can we do that for the rest of our lives?

00:48:27.540 --> 00:48:29.100
I’m bringing dolls for the kids.

00:48:29.480 --> 00:48:30.700
Marn is going to love them so much.

00:48:32.630 --> 00:48:33.330
Let’s hurry.

00:48:33.660 --> 00:48:35.200
Mother just called to ask
when we’ll arrive.

00:48:35.500 --> 00:48:37.490
She said the kids miss
their big sister so bad.

00:48:38.560 --> 00:48:39.470
Who are you calling “big sister”?

00:48:42.180 --> 00:48:44.500
Let’s take my car, so I can go straight
to my condo afterward.

00:48:48.260 --> 00:48:49.000
But you’re driving.

00:48:53.040 --> 00:48:53.950
Okay.

00:48:55.300 --> 00:48:55.850
Let’s go.

00:49:04.810 --> 00:49:05.350
Mr. Thee.

00:49:09.090 --> 00:49:09.880
Here’s my leave letter.

00:49:16.270 --> 00:49:17.200
How many days this time?

00:49:20.210 --> 00:49:22.900
They said seven days.

00:49:26.210 --> 00:49:29.200
But if anything urgent comes up,
please feel free to call me anytime.

00:49:34.840 --> 00:49:37.450
BAAN KLAMAI PLAYGROUND

00:49:37.560 --> 00:49:38.250
Come on!

00:49:41.330 --> 00:49:43.900
Plub never grew up in my eyes.

00:49:44.210 --> 00:49:46.550
She’s still as mischievous
as when she was a kid.

00:49:47.190 --> 00:49:48.770
Plub is actually amazing.

00:49:49.750 --> 00:49:51.400
She becomes a completely
different person when she works.

00:49:52.210 --> 00:49:55.180
You’re both amazing.

00:49:56.530 --> 00:49:58.100
You two grew up really well.

00:49:58.370 --> 00:50:01.300
All because you raised us well, Mother.

00:50:01.680 --> 00:50:02.800
We are who we are today because of you.

00:50:05.400 --> 00:50:09.650
Peach, do you remember
what you said to me back then?

00:50:14.030 --> 00:50:15.900
Is someone taking Plub away, Mother?

00:50:17.270 --> 00:50:19.900
I don’t want to go.
I want to stay with Peach.

00:50:21.560 --> 00:50:24.500
I promise I’ll study hard
and save a lot of money.

00:50:24.900 --> 00:50:28.200
While I’m saving, can you please take care
of Lookplub, Mother?

00:50:29.040 --> 00:50:31.100
I’ll come back for her.

00:50:41.090 --> 00:50:44.950
I’m really grateful you did what I asked.

00:50:47.250 --> 00:50:52.500
Your eyes that day
told me you could do it.

00:50:53.650 --> 00:50:58.300
And today, you’ve shown me that
you can take care of Plub really well.

00:51:05.770 --> 00:51:08.600
How are the new kids?

00:51:09.880 --> 00:51:10.450
Peach!

00:51:11.270 --> 00:51:12.150
Come play with us.

00:51:12.850 --> 00:51:14.020
Marn, Mork, go get Peach.

00:51:14.050 --> 00:51:14.590
Got it.

00:51:17.280 --> 00:51:17.650
Alright.

00:51:17.690 --> 00:51:18.910
-Come on.
-Okay.

00:51:18.950 --> 00:51:19.520
Let’s go.

00:51:19.550 --> 00:51:21.200
Oh, your hands are messy.

00:51:22.380 --> 00:51:23.090
Give me your legs too.

00:51:23.110 --> 00:51:23.670
Okay.

00:51:25.130 --> 00:51:26.090
Run! They’re coming!

00:51:26.150 --> 00:51:27.470
We’re coming!

00:51:28.610 --> 00:51:29.680
Come here!

00:51:31.320 --> 00:51:32.370
I’m almost there.

00:51:32.640 --> 00:51:33.520
We’re about to pass you.

00:51:43.230 --> 00:51:44.300
We’ve arrived at your condo.

00:51:48.180 --> 00:51:49.630
We’ve arrived?

00:51:51.900 --> 00:51:53.310
All that mischief wore you out.

00:51:54.980 --> 00:51:56.600
Well, I don’t get to go home often.

00:51:58.270 --> 00:51:59.800
Go take a shower and sleep.

00:52:02.720 --> 00:52:03.530
Go now.

00:52:07.040 --> 00:52:08.100
Oh, your hair smells sweaty.

00:52:08.960 --> 00:52:10.040
Who asked you to kiss it?

00:52:11.410 --> 00:52:12.110
I’m going now.

00:52:26.750 --> 00:52:27.200
Plub.

00:52:29.660 --> 00:52:30.470
You forgot your car key.

00:52:33.160 --> 00:52:33.900
Thank you.

00:52:35.530 --> 00:52:35.980
Plub.

00:52:37.730 --> 00:52:39.230
I’m so proud of you.

00:52:41.540 --> 00:52:43.600
I’m so proud of you too, brother.

00:52:47.040 --> 00:52:48.100
Go take a shower and sleep.

00:52:50.820 --> 00:52:52.100
Let me know when you get home.

00:52:53.450 --> 00:52:54.250
Have you booked a ride?

00:52:54.930 --> 00:52:55.550
Yes.

00:52:56.450 --> 00:52:56.960
Okay.

00:52:57.230 --> 00:52:57.770
Bye-bye.

00:52:58.220 --> 00:52:58.730
Bye-bye.

00:53:12.990 --> 00:53:13.630
Hello.

00:53:14.860 --> 00:53:15.810
Oh, where are you?

00:53:17.190 --> 00:53:19.650
Anything that can help me spot you?

00:53:20.860 --> 00:53:23.450
Oh, okay. You need to take a U-turn there.

00:53:23.780 --> 00:53:25.450
I’ll walk over. Okay.

00:53:27.170 --> 00:53:27.700
Ouch!

00:53:31.380 --> 00:53:31.900
Wiwid.

00:53:32.760 --> 00:53:34.900
You’re the one who screwed up my life,
aren’t you?

00:53:36.250 --> 00:53:37.400
Where do you think you’re going?

00:53:38.460 --> 00:53:39.810
Where are you going, huh?

00:53:40.680 --> 00:53:41.250
Come here!

00:53:43.680 --> 00:53:44.490
Damn it!

00:53:48.100 --> 00:53:49.180
Ouch!

00:53:50.620 --> 00:53:51.100
Hey!

00:54:12.080 --> 00:54:13.800
Where the hell
are you running off to, huh?

00:54:14.930 --> 00:54:16.400
Do you think you can run away from me?

00:54:17.220 --> 00:54:18.800
You’re so cocky, huh?

00:54:19.740 --> 00:54:20.900
Stop pissing me the hell off.

00:54:21.050 --> 00:54:21.900
You see what this is?

00:54:22.170 --> 00:54:22.600
Huh?

00:54:23.940 --> 00:54:24.430
Hey!

00:54:24.600 --> 00:54:25.100
Let go!

00:54:25.180 --> 00:54:26.400
Calm down!

00:54:27.100 --> 00:54:28.600
Hey! No!

00:54:29.120 --> 00:54:29.810
I told you to stop!

00:54:30.440 --> 00:54:30.860
Hey!

00:54:31.740 --> 00:54:32.360
Hey! Don’t do it!

00:54:37.260 --> 00:54:38.200
Don’t hurt the kids!

00:54:41.190 --> 00:54:42.070
I’m going to hit you!

00:54:46.560 --> 00:54:47.050
Mr. Thee!

00:54:49.790 --> 00:54:50.750
Hold on, Mr. Thee.

00:54:51.570 --> 00:54:53.670
Please calm down and drop your gun,
Mr. Thee.

00:54:53.690 --> 00:54:54.500
Nothing’s going on here.

00:54:55.530 --> 00:54:56.340
Please drop the gun.

00:54:56.840 --> 00:54:57.450
Please calm down.

00:55:05.730 --> 00:55:06.430
Ouch!

00:55:12.820 --> 00:55:13.360
Ouch!

00:55:18.480 --> 00:55:19.100
Ouch!

00:55:20.820 --> 00:55:22.500
Please calm down.

00:55:23.340 --> 00:55:23.980
Ouch!

00:55:25.520 --> 00:55:26.000
Calm down.

00:55:27.060 --> 00:55:27.750
Please calm down.

00:55:28.740 --> 00:55:29.250
Hey.

00:55:29.460 --> 00:55:29.960
No.

00:55:31.580 --> 00:55:32.200
Don’t shoot.

00:55:34.690 --> 00:55:38.150
I’m not going to kill him,
but he needs to hurt more than you do.

00:55:39.260 --> 00:55:39.890
Many times more.

00:56:08.340 --> 00:56:10.400
Welcome, Mr. Kritdanai.

00:56:15.900 --> 00:56:16.730
I missed you so much.

00:56:34.300 --> 00:56:36.210
If you’d opened your eyes
just one hour later,

00:56:36.230 --> 00:56:37.840
I would've gone into your dream
to pull you out.

00:56:37.880 --> 00:56:38.980
There’s nothing to worry about.

00:56:39.020 --> 00:56:39.580
Are you sure?

00:56:40.590 --> 00:56:41.410
Let me open it for you.

00:56:41.440 --> 00:56:42.150
(Whose voice is that?)

00:56:42.970 --> 00:56:44.160
Hide! My sister is on her way here!

00:56:44.280 --> 00:56:45.380
But you have a lot of stuff in here.

00:56:45.420 --> 00:56:46.120
Try to get in.

00:56:46.150 --> 00:56:47.250
I’m trying.

00:56:48.880 --> 00:56:51.500
(Hope you enjoy this peaceful rest.)

00:56:51.630 --> 00:56:52.990
It’s not so peaceful anymore
because of you.

00:56:53.340 --> 00:56:55.090
You’ve crushed my heart into pieces.

00:56:55.130 --> 00:56:55.920
So cheesy.

00:56:56.070 --> 00:56:57.000
I want to try playing it.

00:56:57.520 --> 00:56:58.290
Are you interested in music?

00:56:58.310 --> 00:56:59.170
I’m interested in you.
