00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:04.280
How does this outfit look?

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:08.240
Quit selling houses, selling insurance now?

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:14.360
What's up with you today, Meng?

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:15.919
So jumpy since early morning.

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:18.159
My mother‑in‑law is coming.

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.400
Lao Meng, that ugly mug, remarried?

00:02:22.719 --> 00:02:23.520
No.

00:02:23.919 --> 00:02:25.479
It's Meng Meng's birth mom.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.159
She heard we're getting married.

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:28.000
She's coming to check on us.

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:35.080
Curtains are washed.

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.919
Sofa's wiped.

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.159
TV stand's wiped down.

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.360
The floor's all mopped.

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:41.199
Mom.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.240
You're dropping crumbs eating.

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:46.800
I just mopped this floor.

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:48.240
If you don't shout,

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:49.800
how would I fall to the floor?

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:51.199
I was just—

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.840
Meng Meng.

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:52.759
Meng Meng.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.919
I think you're a bit too nervous now.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.439
I know you want your mom

00:02:58.439 --> 00:02:59.479
to see you're doing well,

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:00.479
so she can relax.

00:03:00.719 --> 00:03:02.479
But you're already perfect now.

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:04.840
I do want her to see

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:05.800
that I'm doing great.

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:07.800
But not to put her at ease,

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.400
it's to make her feel bad.

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:11.080
Why would you?

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.599
She abandoned me back then.

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:36.599
Sit down, would you?

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:37.639
I'm getting dizzy.

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:45.000
You go.

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.000
You go on.

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.639
You go.

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:50.400
Let's go together, together.

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:55.360
Come on, let's go, go.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.439
You open it.

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:59.680
Go on, open it.

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:00.400
You open it.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:01.639
It's your mom.

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:02.319
You open it.

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:10.599
Delivery.

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:14.280
Thanks.

00:04:14.919 --> 00:04:15.360
Delivery.

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:16.600
Why deliver it right now?

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:17.360
Who is it?

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:21.160
Meng Hang?

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.959
Meng Hang.

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:26.240
Meng Hang.

00:04:26.839 --> 00:04:27.480
Meng Hang.

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:28.519
Meng Hang.

00:04:28.519 --> 00:04:29.160
Auntie.

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:30.000
Hello, Auntie.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:31.040
Let me carry that for you.

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:33.399
This little maid is so polite.

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:35.360
No, Auntie—

00:04:35.839 --> 00:04:37.079
I'm Meng Hang's wife.

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.360
My name is Li Lili.

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.480
Lao Meng posted on Moments,

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:44.879
said his son married a rich heiress.

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:46.519
So that’s you?

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.120
Sorry, Auntie,

00:04:50.519 --> 00:04:51.600
to disappoint you.

00:04:51.959 --> 00:04:52.800
It's fine, it's fine.

00:04:53.079 --> 00:04:53.680
Well…

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:55.639
Lao Meng is just like that,

00:04:55.759 --> 00:04:56.639
so vain.

00:04:56.839 --> 00:04:58.279
When he dated me back then,

00:04:58.439 --> 00:04:59.600
he told everyone

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:00.639
I was a flight attendant.

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:02.000
In reality,

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.040
I was just a bus conductor.

00:05:06.759 --> 00:05:07.639
This girl,

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:09.360
she looks pleasing.

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:11.920
Face like a bright full moon,

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:13.120
wealth is coming to this home.

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:15.079
At a glance,

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:16.360
she clearly brings luck to her man.

00:05:17.439 --> 00:05:18.279
Thank you, Auntie.

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.240
Let’s go inside and talk.

00:05:20.439 --> 00:05:20.800
Let’s go.

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:21.279
Go on.

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:22.519
Hurry, get inside.

00:05:30.439 --> 00:05:30.959
Go.

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.279
This place has changed a lot.

00:05:34.839 --> 00:05:35.399
Yeah.

00:05:35.439 --> 00:05:36.480
When we got married,

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:37.639
we had it redecorated.

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:40.079
Meng Hang, show Auntie around.

00:05:43.439 --> 00:05:44.120
Go on.

00:05:44.319 --> 00:05:46.319
Aren't you best at showing houses?

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:55.879
Good

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:56.759
Good, yes

00:05:56.959 --> 00:05:57.519
This

00:05:57.519 --> 00:05:59.199
Many old items are still here

00:05:59.399 --> 00:06:00.639
This... this isn't

00:06:00.839 --> 00:06:02.519
The birdcage is still here

00:06:03.759 --> 00:06:04.959
Back then we used it

00:06:05.519 --> 00:06:06.959
To dry Hanghang's diapers

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:08.680
Good ventilation

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:09.920
Dried very quickly

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:10.759
Right

00:06:12.839 --> 00:06:14.160
Auntie, please sit

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:28.800
You

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:30.839
Live with your father?

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:31.920
Where is he?

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:34.279
He's away performing these days

00:06:35.199 --> 00:06:36.399
Still rolling

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:37.199
Rolling

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:37.839
Always rolling

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:38.800
Rolls really well

00:06:45.319 --> 00:06:46.000
Hanghang

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:47.839
These years

00:06:47.839 --> 00:06:49.040
How have you been?

00:06:51.839 --> 00:06:53.000
Still alive anyway

00:06:57.519 --> 00:06:58.279
You guys

00:06:58.279 --> 00:06:58.800
Talk

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:00.279
I'll take a conference call

00:07:05.759 --> 00:07:06.319
Well

00:07:06.639 --> 00:07:07.199
Auntie

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:09.000
Don't take it to heart

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:10.120
Meng Hang, he

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:11.040
I don't blame him

00:07:11.399 --> 00:07:12.399
I don't blame Hanghang

00:07:13.079 --> 00:07:14.079
During the divorce

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:15.920
I was young and foolish

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:18.600
Left Hanghang with his father

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:20.639
Now that I'm older

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.560
Regret comes too late

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:26.360
The child and I

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.680
Have become complete strangers

00:07:30.959 --> 00:07:32.439
You're Hanghang's wife

00:07:32.639 --> 00:07:33.759
Seeing you today

00:07:34.319 --> 00:07:35.519
Feels very close

00:07:35.759 --> 00:07:36.360
Really

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:37.800
Really, I remember

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:38.480
Right

00:07:39.879 --> 00:07:40.439
Why

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:43.120
Why are you avoiding me?

00:07:44.079 --> 00:07:44.879
No, auntie

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:45.600
Well

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:47.720
I've heard some stories about you

00:07:50.399 --> 00:07:51.160
Don't need to ask

00:07:51.199 --> 00:07:53.319
Must be Lao Meng badmouthing me

00:07:55.199 --> 00:07:55.920
Let me put it this way

00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:57.199
Auntie, I

00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:58.639
Though quick-tempered

00:07:58.639 --> 00:08:00.720
Always persuade with virtue

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:02.240
Like that time

00:08:02.399 --> 00:08:03.639
Fought four thugs

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:04.759
That was because

00:08:05.079 --> 00:08:07.199
They whistled at me first

00:08:08.199 --> 00:08:10.279
Haven't heard this part

00:08:10.319 --> 00:08:11.000
Then what?

00:08:11.319 --> 00:08:12.279
What happened was

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:14.240
Orthopedic hospital near BBQ place

00:08:14.319 --> 00:08:15.920
Got four patients in one day

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:19.000
Those thugs

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:20.680
Should thank me for knowing law

00:08:20.879 --> 00:08:22.160
I could precisely judge

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:23.439
Between self-defense

00:08:23.439 --> 00:08:25.199
And excessive defense

00:08:25.199 --> 00:08:26.079
Auntie

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:27.600
You're too fierce

00:08:28.879 --> 00:08:30.839
You think I want to be?

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.320
Who doesn't want a man

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:34.240
To cherish and protect them

00:08:34.639 --> 00:08:35.159
But

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:36.799
Not every man

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.440
Is like Ken Takakura

00:08:38.559 --> 00:08:40.080
Giving enough sense of protection

00:08:40.399 --> 00:08:41.080
So

00:08:41.279 --> 00:08:42.480
Can only rely on myself

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:44.120
Forcing us roses

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:45.200
To become tough

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:46.080
Auntie

00:08:46.519 --> 00:08:49.120
You're truly the strong heroine type

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:52.360
Why still call me auntie?

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:53.799
You should call me mom

00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:57.919
You

00:08:58.679 --> 00:09:01.000
Do you dislike me too?

00:09:01.159 --> 00:09:02.200
No, no

00:09:03.279 --> 00:09:03.759
No

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:04.799
Mom

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:06.759
Mom

00:09:09.519 --> 00:09:10.559
Good child

00:09:11.399 --> 00:09:12.600
Daughter-in-law

00:09:12.799 --> 00:09:13.639
Mom, mom, mom

00:09:17.559 --> 00:09:18.519
Good child

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:21.279
Good child

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:28.360
Really?

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:29.000
How fancy.

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:30.639
This white looks perfect on you.

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:32.159
Is it too long?

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:32.639
No.

00:09:32.679 --> 00:09:33.240
Not long, not at all.

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:34.600
I'll pair it with a belt later.

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:35.080
Exactly.

00:09:35.559 --> 00:09:35.840
Looks good.

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:36.919
This cinching, right?

00:09:37.039 --> 00:09:38.000
Yes yes, this looks great.

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:39.000
Really beautiful.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.039
Thanks for the gift, Mom.

00:09:43.559 --> 00:09:44.240
Mom bought it.

00:09:44.279 --> 00:09:44.960
Does it look good?

00:09:45.679 --> 00:09:47.240
I bought you a suit.

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:48.200
For the wedding day.

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:49.679
Try it on for fit.

00:09:50.519 --> 00:09:51.679
I don't wear suits.

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:53.919
Why not wear a suit for wedding?

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:54.919
Changed to Chinese style.

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:56.600
When did you change?

00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:57.759
Just now.

00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:00.320
You can change but I can't?

00:10:03.759 --> 00:10:04.360
Look.

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:05.279
No.

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:07.720
I just talked with Mom.

00:10:08.159 --> 00:10:10.279
She regrets leaving you.

00:10:10.559 --> 00:10:12.480
But she had her reasons.

00:10:12.679 --> 00:10:14.559
I think it's not that serious.

00:10:14.679 --> 00:10:16.120
You call her Mom now.

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:17.240
Then what do I call her?

00:10:17.279 --> 00:10:18.159
I'll call her sis.

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:20.039
You two enjoy your bond.

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:21.240
I'm going to the pet store.

00:10:21.799 --> 00:10:22.399
To feed the dogs.

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:27.919
It's fine.

00:10:28.159 --> 00:10:28.759
Don't mind him.

00:10:28.759 --> 00:10:29.840
He'll be fine soon.

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:31.639
He doesn't need to try this suit.

00:10:31.679 --> 00:10:32.480
Mother-son connection.

00:10:32.559 --> 00:10:33.200
You bought it.

00:10:33.279 --> 00:10:34.799
It must be his size.

00:10:58.080 --> 00:10:59.440
Ignored him before.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.759
Now pretending to care?

00:11:05.279 --> 00:11:06.759
You little rascals.

00:11:08.399 --> 00:11:09.399
You're five months old.

00:11:09.399 --> 00:11:10.879
Still nursing by mom.

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:12.639
Showing me motherly love?

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:13.279
Is that so?

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:14.000
Look.

00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:15.440
See?

00:11:16.679 --> 00:11:17.120
You're...

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:18.759
Why mad at puppies?

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:20.679
I'm not mad at them.

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:21.600
Then who?

00:11:23.159 --> 00:11:24.840
It's Lili and her mom.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:26.879
Did I offend you?

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:28.360
No, not you.

00:11:28.519 --> 00:11:29.120
Then who?

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:30.919
Lili's mother-in-law.

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:32.159
Lili's mother-in-law.

00:11:32.879 --> 00:11:34.480
Just say it's your mom.

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:35.480
Wouldn't that be easier?

00:11:35.879 --> 00:11:36.600
I know about this.

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:37.399
Lili told me.

00:11:37.399 --> 00:11:38.679
I thought to close early.

00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:40.000
Go see her.

00:11:40.159 --> 00:11:40.799
Don't bother.

00:11:41.159 --> 00:11:41.919
Nothing worth seeing.

00:11:42.919 --> 00:11:44.279
Heard your...

00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:45.639
Mother-in-law relations are bad.

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:48.519
Maybe they're fighting now.

00:11:48.639 --> 00:11:49.799
I should go check.

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:50.879
What a scene.

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:51.799
Don't worry.

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:52.399
They won't fight.

00:11:52.399 --> 00:11:53.440
They get along fine.

00:11:53.919 --> 00:11:54.759
Rest assured.

00:11:54.759 --> 00:11:55.840
I'm here.

00:11:59.200 --> 00:11:59.639
Don't.

00:11:59.759 --> 00:12:01.600
Don't really fight now.

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:02.519
You...

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:13.159
Where is she?

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:14.720
Where is this place?

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:16.159
The scenery is gorgeous.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.120
This is Australian Hunter Valley Forest.

00:12:20.399 --> 00:12:21.519
What are you two chatting about?

00:12:22.919 --> 00:12:24.679
Your wife is laughing so happily.

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:26.879
She’s definitely badmouthing me.

00:12:28.559 --> 00:12:29.879
I went there as a volunteer

00:12:29.919 --> 00:12:32.159
and joined the on-site cleanup.

00:12:32.919 --> 00:12:34.320
I saw so many burned to death,

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:35.679
koalas and kangaroos.

00:12:36.039 --> 00:12:37.000
I realized

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:39.879
a kangaroo mom, until the fire took her,

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:41.200
still desperately shielded

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:42.840
her baby in her pouch.

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:44.720
And those koalas,

00:12:45.279 --> 00:12:46.679
they would rather burn to death

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:49.759
than abandon their joeys and run.

00:12:50.679 --> 00:12:51.600
At that moment

00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:54.440
I just broke down inside.

00:12:55.799 --> 00:12:56.799
I felt that I

00:12:57.159 --> 00:12:58.559
was not even as good as them.

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:01.080
After that,

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:03.159
whenever I see koalas or kangaroos,

00:13:03.519 --> 00:13:04.960
I think of Hanghang.

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:06.159
Told you.

00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:08.600
They never have anything nice to say.

00:13:09.159 --> 00:13:10.360
Thinking of kangaroos and koalas

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:11.480
makes her think of me.

00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:13.960
Why?

00:13:15.879 --> 00:13:17.840
She must think I was too naughty.

00:13:18.159 --> 00:13:19.360
Always jumping all over the place.

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:22.000
See?

00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:25.200
Her warmth is totally an act.

00:13:26.279 --> 00:13:27.759
She doesn’t like me at all.

00:13:28.279 --> 00:13:29.440
Makes sense.

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:31.120
Oh, right.

00:13:31.559 --> 00:13:33.320
I asked for your birth date and time.

00:13:33.759 --> 00:13:34.440
They said you

00:13:34.799 --> 00:13:35.879
are “lacking Metal” in destiny.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.039
So I bought you

00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:39.120
a gold bracelet.

00:13:40.639 --> 00:13:41.320
Put it on.

00:13:42.639 --> 00:13:43.799
This looks so beautiful.

00:13:44.159 --> 00:13:44.720
Do you like it?

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:45.639
I do, I really do.

00:13:45.759 --> 00:13:46.519
Thank you, Mom.

00:13:47.279 --> 00:13:48.159
To be honest,

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:49.919
before this,

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:52.120
I never really felt much motherly love.

00:13:52.399 --> 00:13:53.279
But the moment I saw you,

00:13:53.279 --> 00:13:54.799
I felt especially close to you.

00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:57.080
From now on, treat me as your own girl.

00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:58.679
And I’ll treat you as my own mom.

00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:03.480
Already calling the thief “mother,” huh.

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:10.720
Mom, why are you back?

00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:12.399
I came back early.

00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:13.679
Am I interrupting?

00:14:13.919 --> 00:14:14.840
That's not what I meant.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:16.039
Let me introduce you.

00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:16.559
This is...

00:14:16.559 --> 00:14:17.200
No need.

00:14:17.759 --> 00:14:18.639
This is the bride.

00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:20.919
Hello, co-mother-in-law.

00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:22.000
You're wrong.

00:14:22.039 --> 00:14:23.399
How am I the bride?

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:24.600
Lili is the bride.

00:14:24.759 --> 00:14:25.720
I'm not wrong.

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:27.639
You're her newly recognized mom.

00:14:27.759 --> 00:14:28.960
What are you saying, Mom?

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:30.960
Co-mother-in-law is so humorous.

00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:33.480
No wonder Lili is so witty too.

00:14:33.639 --> 00:14:34.440
Co-mother-in-law.

00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:35.879
I really envy you.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.279
Having such a good child.

00:14:38.159 --> 00:14:39.000
If you like her, take her.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.000
I'll give you 20% off.

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:41.200
Mom.

00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:42.039
Co-mother-in-law.

00:14:42.039 --> 00:14:43.159
You're so beautiful.

00:14:43.399 --> 00:14:44.200
Such grace.

00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:45.039
Such a figure.

00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:46.080
And so stylish.

00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:46.799
Yes.

00:14:47.279 --> 00:14:48.600
You're quite stylish too.

00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:50.559
Nice essential oil balm. Where'd you get it?

00:14:51.039 --> 00:14:52.039
Essential oil balm.

00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:52.960
Um...

00:14:53.159 --> 00:14:53.600
Mom.

00:14:53.919 --> 00:14:55.000
We're going shopping.

00:14:55.039 --> 00:14:55.679
Want to come?

00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:56.879
Let's go together.

00:14:57.399 --> 00:14:58.960
Then I'd feel like a third wheel.

00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:00.480
We're going then.

00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:01.279
Let's go, go, go.

00:15:01.279 --> 00:15:02.159
That's just how my mom is.

00:15:02.159 --> 00:15:02.919
Go, go, go.

00:15:02.919 --> 00:15:03.799
I'll be back soon.

00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:07.080
Hurry, hurry.

00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:07.960
It's fine, it's fine.

00:15:08.399 --> 00:15:09.159
That's just how she is.

00:15:20.559 --> 00:15:21.440
See? See?

00:15:21.639 --> 00:15:22.639
They're arm in arm.

00:15:24.039 --> 00:15:25.080
Your wife, from childhood to now,

00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:26.440
has never treated me like this.

00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:28.480
Ungrateful.

00:15:28.799 --> 00:15:30.679
I'm always so good to her.

00:15:32.799 --> 00:15:33.519
For example...

00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:35.200
First...

00:15:37.799 --> 00:15:40.200
My usual attitude toward her...

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:42.480
Let's not...

00:15:43.039 --> 00:15:44.159
talk about attitude.

00:15:44.559 --> 00:15:45.320
Let's just say...

00:15:45.519 --> 00:15:46.440
my...

00:15:46.519 --> 00:15:47.200
care for her.

00:15:49.279 --> 00:15:50.320
Never mind the care.

00:15:50.559 --> 00:15:51.240
Let's just say...

00:15:51.559 --> 00:15:52.519
my...

00:15:52.679 --> 00:15:53.360
tolerance of her.

00:15:54.039 --> 00:15:56.039
Why are you humming? Huh?

00:15:56.399 --> 00:15:58.039
I accepted her marrying you.

00:15:58.039 --> 00:15:59.519
Isn't that tolerant enough?

00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:00.360
Get out.

00:16:33.039 --> 00:16:34.559
I can't stay on Earth anymore.

00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:36.960
I've only been here a short while,

00:16:37.519 --> 00:16:40.159
and already learned human fickleness.

00:16:48.639 --> 00:16:50.840
It's so late, why aren't they back?

00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:52.960
Living on Australian time.

00:16:57.519 --> 00:16:58.639
We're back.

00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:01.000
Back.

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:04.279
Couldn't you coordinate outfits?

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:05.839
You're twinning.

00:17:07.079 --> 00:17:09.200
Mom, these are mother-daughter outfits.

00:17:10.119 --> 00:17:10.640
Mom.

00:17:10.799 --> 00:17:11.680
I suggested buying them.

00:17:11.799 --> 00:17:13.559
I always saw people wear them as a kid.

00:17:13.599 --> 00:17:15.279
Never got to wear them growing up.

00:17:15.359 --> 00:17:16.839
Making up for that regret now.

00:17:22.319 --> 00:17:22.960
Meng Hang

00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:25.200
Mom bought one for you too.

00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:26.759
See? You’re in Mom’s heart.

00:17:27.319 --> 00:17:28.279
I-I don’t want it.

00:17:30.759 --> 00:17:31.920
So I’m just the extra one.

00:17:33.079 --> 00:17:33.880
Co-mother-in-law,

00:17:34.079 --> 00:17:35.519
I bought you a sleeveless vest.

00:17:35.799 --> 00:17:37.519
At our age, it’s easy to catch cold.

00:17:37.759 --> 00:17:38.839
We must keep ourselves warm.

00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:40.279
Exactly.

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:42.519
My “little padded jacket” for years

00:17:42.519 --> 00:17:43.680
has been “worn away” by someone else.

00:17:43.759 --> 00:17:45.160
Of course I feel cold now.

00:17:48.119 --> 00:17:48.599
It’s okay.

00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:50.160
Co-mother-in-law,

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:51.119
try it on.

00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:52.359
It looks really nice.

00:17:52.599 --> 00:17:53.799
Go inside, go on in.

00:17:54.079 --> 00:17:55.680
Meng Hang, I’ll put this in your room.

00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:03.799
You’ve talked all day and still are.

00:18:04.079 --> 00:18:05.680
How can you have so much to say?

00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:07.400
If you’re curious, go listen.

00:18:08.839 --> 00:18:10.400
I don’t care at all.

00:18:10.799 --> 00:18:11.720
You’re funny.

00:18:24.599 --> 00:18:25.160
Mom,

00:18:25.559 --> 00:18:26.519
thank you.

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:28.480
Growing up,

00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:30.880
my own mom never bought me things.

00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:33.160
You let me feel what it’s like

00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:35.200
to be a child treasured by a mother.

00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:36.480
Good girl.

00:18:37.039 --> 00:18:37.680
From now on,

00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:39.119
whenever you want motherly love,

00:18:39.519 --> 00:18:40.440
just come to Mom for it.

00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:41.759
Mom’s got more than enough.

00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:44.759
I’ve lacked love for over twenty years.

00:18:45.119 --> 00:18:46.759
Now I’ve got a buffet of mother’s love.

00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:49.960
Actually,

00:18:50.799 --> 00:18:51.880
there’s someone else

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.400
who also really lacks a mother’s love.

00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:57.640
I want to give it,

00:18:58.480 --> 00:18:59.519
but he won’t take it.

00:19:00.119 --> 00:19:00.960
I came this time

00:19:01.319 --> 00:19:03.359
just to see if he’s doing okay.

00:19:04.839 --> 00:19:06.240
Now that I see

00:19:06.559 --> 00:19:08.279
he has someone as great as you,

00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:09.960
I’m relieved.

00:19:12.279 --> 00:19:13.240
I’ve bought my plane ticket.

00:19:13.279 --> 00:19:14.359
I’ll fly back the day after tomorrow.

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:16.079
Without me around,

00:19:16.359 --> 00:19:17.319
he might be a bit happier.

00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:23.559
Mom,

00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:26.960
these osmanthus cakes,

00:19:27.279 --> 00:19:29.359
he ran across half the city to buy.

00:19:29.519 --> 00:19:30.400
No one at home

00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:31.440
actually likes eating them.

00:19:32.119 --> 00:19:32.960
I guess

00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:34.359
they weren’t bought for us.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:36.839
He bought them

00:19:39.519 --> 00:19:40.480
because I love them.

00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:43.000
He still remembers.

00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:47.039
So you see,

00:19:47.119 --> 00:19:48.799
it’s not that he doesn’t love you.

00:19:49.119 --> 00:19:50.160
He just, for the moment,

00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:51.519
doesn’t know how to accept it.

00:19:52.319 --> 00:19:53.200
I know too well

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:55.359
how it feels to crave love and not get it.

00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:58.440
So I don’t want him hurting like I did.

00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:00.240
Please help him.

00:20:03.039 --> 00:20:04.559
Then how am I supposed to help?

00:20:08.359 --> 00:20:09.599
How is he “lacking love”?

00:20:09.759 --> 00:20:11.759
Why doesn’t he feel like a treasure to me?

00:20:13.279 --> 00:20:14.279
In the fall of ’99,

00:20:14.359 --> 00:20:15.839
I even bought you a pair of socks.

00:20:25.119 --> 00:20:26.279
Besides,

00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:28.279
you defect just for someone else’s gifts.

00:20:28.759 --> 00:20:29.559
If you don’t say it,

00:20:29.559 --> 00:20:31.440
how would I know you like presents?

00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:33.400
It’s not like I can’t buy them.

00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:39.880
my big baby.

00:20:45.319 --> 00:20:45.920
Li Lili,

00:20:47.119 --> 00:20:47.759
get over here.

00:20:51.599 --> 00:20:51.960
Mom,

00:20:52.279 --> 00:20:54.160
I still have to go out
shopping with my mother‑in‑law.

00:20:54.559 --> 00:20:55.680
Can we argue another day?

00:20:56.960 --> 00:20:58.039
I'm not here to fight with you.

00:20:58.319 --> 00:21:00.400
I got you a birthday present.

00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:06.039
When things seem off,
something’s fishy.

00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:09.039
Did you sprain your back again?

00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:11.680
Can you stop cursing me?

00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:13.599
So what birthday gift
did you buy me?

00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:15.319
My birthday was ages ago.

00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:16.359
I was still…

00:21:16.559 --> 00:21:18.920
searching for the right gift.

00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:21.559
Your mother‑in‑law said
you’re lacking Metal.

00:21:21.839 --> 00:21:24.519
How many jin is that metal
in your hand?

00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:26.960
Twenty‑six grams.

00:21:29.119 --> 00:21:30.200
Eighty thousand grams.

00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:31.480
Carry it with you.

00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:32.920
You’ll never lack “jin” again.

00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:36.079
Oh, give me a break, Mom.

00:21:36.359 --> 00:21:38.440
You want me hauling big dumbbells
every day?

00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:39.680
I’m just a young girl.

00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:41.799
That’s why I bought pink ones.

00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:42.960
I don’t want them.

00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:44.000
You keep them yourself.

00:21:44.079 --> 00:21:45.039
I’m going to my mother‑in‑law.

00:21:45.559 --> 00:21:46.319
What mother‑in‑law?

00:21:47.039 --> 00:21:47.720
You dare ignore me?

00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:51.480
You’re not lacking Metal.

00:21:51.559 --> 00:21:53.119
You’re lacking a good beating.

00:22:01.759 --> 00:22:02.839
Mom’s back.

00:22:03.519 --> 00:22:04.640
The daughter‑in‑law’s gone.

00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:12.240
No

00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:12.720
Mom

00:22:13.839 --> 00:22:14.920
Who are you with?

00:22:15.039 --> 00:22:16.000
Shopping together

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:18.279
Eating street food together

00:22:18.839 --> 00:22:20.160
Doing crafts together

00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:22.519
Even checking out handsome old men together

00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:25.279
How could she do this to me?

00:22:25.319 --> 00:22:26.240
Who?

00:22:26.559 --> 00:22:27.960
If she can betray me today

00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:29.880
She'll betray you tomorrow

00:22:30.599 --> 00:22:31.480
Lili!

00:22:32.359 --> 00:22:33.279
You followed her?

00:22:33.519 --> 00:22:35.000
I don't have time for that

00:22:35.079 --> 00:22:36.160
I just accidentally

00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:37.400
Unintentionally... just

00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:38.640
Saw it

00:22:39.279 --> 00:22:40.640
How did you see it?

00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:41.759
It's not

00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:43.279
Where I go

00:22:43.279 --> 00:22:44.480
They go there too

00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:45.759
Isn't that annoying?

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:47.240
Who's following who?

00:22:48.359 --> 00:22:49.759
We're back

00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:51.400
So you remember to come back

00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:53.279
Li Lili!

00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:54.799
What about tomorrow?

00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:57.559
I plan to visit Zhangjiajie

00:22:57.839 --> 00:22:58.640
Come with me

00:22:59.119 --> 00:22:59.759
Tomorrow

00:23:02.119 --> 00:23:02.680
Mom

00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:04.720
My mother-in-law rarely visits

00:23:05.599 --> 00:23:06.799
Let's go later

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:08.359
I won't say it again

00:23:09.839 --> 00:23:10.640
Go ahead

00:23:11.279 --> 00:23:13.279
Don't let me affect your mother-daughter bond

00:23:15.079 --> 00:23:15.799
No

00:23:15.799 --> 00:23:18.359
My mom's being impulsive again

00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:20.160
Watch your tone

00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:21.440
No, you're being

00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:22.680
Sorry, co-mother-in-law

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:24.000
Lili is willful

00:23:24.039 --> 00:23:25.240
Please be understanding

00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:26.640
I'll tolerate

00:23:28.319 --> 00:23:28.839
Okay, okay

00:23:29.279 --> 00:23:30.599
Now you're the real mom

00:23:30.839 --> 00:23:32.720
I'm the outsider now, right?

00:23:33.359 --> 00:23:34.039
That's not what I meant

00:23:34.039 --> 00:23:34.559
No, no

00:23:34.559 --> 00:23:35.440
Not that meaning

00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:36.240
No

00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:36.960
Mom, I didn't mean that

00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:37.880
That's not what I meant

00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:39.039
Uh, Meng Meng

00:23:39.279 --> 00:23:40.480
On my way back

00:23:40.559 --> 00:23:42.160
I met a used DVD seller

00:23:42.319 --> 00:23:43.519
Let's watch together tonight

00:23:44.359 --> 00:23:46.119
I haven't seen this one

00:23:48.519 --> 00:23:50.119
My Beloved

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:54.960
This suits you and mom

00:23:56.759 --> 00:23:58.119
Not for me

00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:01.200
Meng Meng

00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:04.400
Then I'll endure

00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:05.480
And watch with you

00:24:06.839 --> 00:24:08.640
Mom, you can't watch this

00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:10.920
Too emotionally intense

00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:12.640
Like a horror movie for you

00:24:14.279 --> 00:24:15.200
Meng Meng won't watch

00:24:16.519 --> 00:24:17.640
Then let's watch

00:24:31.519 --> 00:24:33.079
Oh, Mou Guiying

00:24:33.079 --> 00:24:34.440
Playing this trick on me

00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:36.720
Stealing my daughter with sweet talk

00:24:41.519 --> 00:24:42.480
Don't tell me

00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:45.559
You don't have a son?

00:24:53.319 --> 00:24:53.880
No, Lili

00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:54.599
Eat slowly

00:24:54.599 --> 00:24:55.519
What's the rush?

00:24:55.599 --> 00:24:56.680
No work today, it's weekend

00:24:57.319 --> 00:24:58.720
Mom's waiting for me

00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:00.480
Shopping date again today

00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:02.920
Meng Meng

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.319
You work so hard

00:25:05.559 --> 00:25:06.920
It pains me to see

00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:08.720
Made you tonic soup

00:25:09.359 --> 00:25:10.039
No

00:25:10.279 --> 00:25:10.960
Mom, this

00:25:12.079 --> 00:25:12.880
What's with you today?

00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:14.079
What's going on?

00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:15.000
Let me feed you

00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:16.519
No, I couldn't

00:25:16.599 --> 00:25:17.519
This isn't proper

00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:20.160
Mom must care for you

00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:21.680
Here

00:25:26.599 --> 00:25:28.599
Like Wu Dalang taking poison

00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:30.000
Did my mom poison you?

00:25:37.519 --> 00:25:39.920
It’s so hot, why didn’t you say?

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:42.000
Isn’t this clearly emotional blackmail?

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:43.079
How would he dare say anything?

00:25:43.839 --> 00:25:45.559
W-what kind of soup is this?

00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:46.519
Seafood.

00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:49.079
I’m allergic to seafood.

00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:02.559
This is still okay.

00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:04.559
Hurry, go.

00:26:13.759 --> 00:26:14.519
You walked past it.

00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:22.319
What are you two doing?

00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:25.960
You two can wear parent–child outfits,

00:26:26.279 --> 00:26:27.559
but we can’t?

00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:32.039
Today, Meng Hang and I

00:26:32.359 --> 00:26:33.319
wore these outfits

00:26:33.519 --> 00:26:34.880
and walked down the shopping street—

00:26:35.359 --> 00:26:36.240
the number of people

00:26:36.519 --> 00:26:37.559
turning to look was sky-high.

00:26:38.039 --> 00:26:39.480
They all envied our

00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:41.000
mother–son bond.

00:26:42.799 --> 00:26:44.319
How could they not stare?

00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:46.519
But that’s not a parent–child outfit.

00:26:46.519 --> 00:26:47.839
It’s a couple’s outfit.

00:27:13.359 --> 00:27:14.039
Co-mother-in-law,

00:27:14.799 --> 00:27:15.880
let’s talk.

00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:18.599
Oh, as if I’m scared of you.

00:27:19.319 --> 00:27:21.519
You’re extra nice to Hanghang

00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:23.880
so he’ll resent me more,

00:27:24.319 --> 00:27:24.920
right?

00:27:27.519 --> 00:27:28.720
That’s only because

00:27:28.759 --> 00:27:31.880
you used “motherly love” to divide me and my girl.

00:27:32.839 --> 00:27:33.599
Actually,

00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:36.640
the reason I treat Li Lili so well

00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:38.480
is, first,

00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:39.559
Li Lili

00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:40.799
is truly lovable.

00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:43.279
And another key reason

00:27:44.079 --> 00:27:47.720
is Hanghang won’t accept my making amends.

00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:48.680
So

00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:51.240
I’ve come up with a plan.

00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:55.960
I don’t care about your plan.

00:27:56.599 --> 00:27:57.519
With me here,

00:27:57.799 --> 00:27:59.279
Meng Hang can feel

00:27:59.279 --> 00:28:02.240
what it’s like to be a cherished child.

00:28:05.279 --> 00:28:06.440
Give me a chance.

00:28:08.119 --> 00:28:09.519
How am I supposed to?

00:28:10.559 --> 00:28:11.400
In the past,

00:28:12.319 --> 00:28:13.599
I had no choice.

00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:16.720
Now I want to be a good mom.

00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:20.160
Fine.

00:28:21.079 --> 00:28:22.200
Go tell Meng Hang.

00:28:24.279 --> 00:28:27.279
See if he even wants you as a good mom.

00:28:32.079 --> 00:28:33.359
So you mean

00:28:33.599 --> 00:28:34.799
I should give up?

00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:38.480
I’m sorry,

00:28:39.039 --> 00:28:40.039
I am his mother.

00:28:41.279 --> 00:28:43.279
So let’s both

00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:45.480
learn how to be good moms.

00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:47.599
Don’t you want that?

00:28:58.960 --> 00:28:59.599
Mom.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:00.880
You cooked?

00:29:01.839 --> 00:29:03.519
The galaxy must be spinning backward.

00:29:04.519 --> 00:29:05.400
Just eat your food.

00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:06.599
Quit with the nonsense.

00:29:11.119 --> 00:29:11.759
Mom.

00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:14.400
You didn’t make these wings.

00:29:15.319 --> 00:29:16.319
Awful, right?

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:18.440
Your mother cooked them all.

00:29:24.319 --> 00:29:25.240
Where is she?

00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:37.759
Mom…

00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:39.839
Sit down.

00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:04.480
I’m going back.

00:30:05.599 --> 00:30:07.240
My flight is tonight.

00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:15.880
Seeing you and Lili so happy

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:17.160
puts my mind at ease.

00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:26.119
I know you hate me.

00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:27.559
So

00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:30.920
I’ve never dared face you.

00:30:32.359 --> 00:30:33.319
These past few days,

00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:35.559
with Lili by my side,

00:30:36.039 --> 00:30:37.279
I figured something out:

00:30:39.279 --> 00:30:41.480
we must pay for our mistakes.

00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:44.680
I’ll prove it with my actions

00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:46.519
and slowly,

00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:49.839
win back your acceptance.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:30.240
No need to see me off.

00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:31.960
Really, don’t.

00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:33.759
The car’s right downstairs.

00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:34.960
The car’s right downstairs.

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:36.559
Um…

00:31:36.839 --> 00:31:37.400
Hanghang…

00:31:38.279 --> 00:31:39.319
This is for you.

00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:41.240
Open it after I leave.

00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:44.759
No need to see me off.

00:31:44.799 --> 00:31:45.640
Really, don’t.

00:31:46.799 --> 00:31:47.839
The car’s right downstairs.

00:31:47.839 --> 00:31:48.680
Go back, go on, go back.

00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:21.160
Mom said when she first left,

00:32:21.519 --> 00:32:22.759
she took nothing with her,

00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:24.799
except this little bear.

00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:41.240
Back then I hugged it every night to sleep.

00:32:42.359 --> 00:32:43.160
Later on,

00:32:43.759 --> 00:32:45.319
Mom held the two of us together.

00:32:50.079 --> 00:32:51.000
Mom said

00:32:51.279 --> 00:32:52.400
all these years,

00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:55.079
she held this little bear every night.

00:32:56.599 --> 00:32:58.240
So it got a bit worn out.

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:01.440
These days we ran all over the place

00:33:01.559 --> 00:33:03.160
trying to find the same fabric.

00:33:04.559 --> 00:33:05.599
But in the end,

00:33:05.599 --> 00:33:07.319
it still turned out a bit different.

00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:09.319
But Mom sewed all of this by hand.

00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:11.720
I even helped with a couple of stitches.

00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:26.839
I don’t even like chicken wings.

00:33:30.799 --> 00:33:32.119
She just thought I loved them.

00:33:33.759 --> 00:33:34.960
I was afraid if I told the truth

00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:37.839
it would make her sad.

00:33:48.559 --> 00:33:50.240
So that’s what this was about.

00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:53.599
You two were glued together lately.

00:33:53.599 --> 00:33:56.160
I thought you adored your mother‑in‑law.

00:33:56.640 --> 00:33:58.160
You forced me to go to her

00:33:58.160 --> 00:34:00.519
and charge a “mother‑daughter transfer fee.”

00:34:01.119 --> 00:34:02.240
Transfer?

00:34:02.839 --> 00:34:04.119
You sold me off?

00:34:09.679 --> 00:34:11.960
Didn’t you throw this away ages ago?

00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:14.079
I picked it back up again.

00:34:14.239 --> 00:34:15.320
You want it or not?

00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:16.079
I do.

00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:20.239
What’s this?

00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:22.320
This was my favorite book as a kid.

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:24.239
My dad left it to me.

00:34:25.039 --> 00:34:26.039
But my mom

00:34:26.639 --> 00:34:28.559
thought the two people in it were crude,

00:34:28.559 --> 00:34:29.599
not even wearing clothes.

00:34:30.199 --> 00:34:32.000
She tossed it without asking me.

00:34:36.599 --> 00:34:38.280
If you want to thank me,

00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:39.559
just pay me in cash.

00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:41.440
Eight hundred and eighty‑eight yuan.

00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:43.599
Not expensive for a childhood memory.

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:47.079
Meng Hang has no idea

00:34:47.119 --> 00:34:48.800
my dad may be an alien,

00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:50.559
but in spirit he’s a real Earthling.

00:34:50.559 --> 00:34:51.679
Let’s call him a “spirithling.”

00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:53.199
Every time he came back from trips,

00:34:53.199 --> 00:34:55.559
he brought me all kinds of Earth comics.

00:34:55.719 --> 00:34:56.960
Every single comic book

00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:59.280
was a precious childhood memory.

00:35:00.159 --> 00:35:01.559
I just don’t get it.

00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:03.079
I gave birth to her—

00:35:03.079 --> 00:35:04.599
well, not literally, of course.

00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:05.840
I raised her—

00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:07.039
well, not literally raised her either.

00:35:07.079 --> 00:35:09.079
So why is she so nice to someone else?

00:35:11.119 --> 00:35:12.079
Let me give you an example.

00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:13.880
Say you’re a manufacturer.

00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:15.840
You pour in labor and materials

00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:17.360
to make this one product.

00:35:18.039 --> 00:35:20.280
Then someone walks off with it for free.

00:35:20.639 --> 00:35:21.960
How does that make any sense?

00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:24.079
Meng Hang,

00:35:25.159 --> 00:35:26.159
come pound my back for me.

00:35:30.679 --> 00:35:36.639
Other people’s “products” really work better.
