So far, several people died in the Chamber of Commerce

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.360
and the Ma Gang.

Looks like the chaos in Xichuan

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:33.720
won't be over any time soon.

Excellent.

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:37.920
The Chamber of Commerce

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.560
has always controlled most of the ways

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.190
of making money in Xichuan.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.020
Now, chaos frequently arises.

We

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.400

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:49.740
to reshuffle.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.150

Let there be chaos.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.960

Steward Sun, as you asked,

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:55.270
we got rid

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:56.550
of all Steward Zhao's men.

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.040
Here are

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.200
some of the industries they own.

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:01.920
What does it have to do with me?

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:03.370
It's all Chamber of Commerce's money.

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.240
You don't know.

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.280
The Chairman doesn't ask much about the accounts.

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:08.930
Steward Zhao was in charge of it.

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.320
He and his men

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:11.710
earned a lot of money.

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:13.560
Is it that profitable?

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.960
I looked into it.

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.080
They took at least 15% of the profits

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.920
every year.

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.180
It's just 15%.

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:22.920
You don't know how big the Chamber of Commerce's business is.

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.760
As you are aware,

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:25.610
the Jibei Army is behind us.

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:27.320
The court can't afford it.

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.080
We have

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.760
to support and arm

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:31.670
hundreds of thousands of people.

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.630
So this money

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.120
will be ours.

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.160
It's all yours, Steward Sun.

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:42.480
I don't understand this.

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:43.860
And I can't read.

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.050
I'll leave the accounts

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.010
to you.

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:50.610
Thank you, Steward.

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.740
It's a cushy job.

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:54.960
A lot of people will be jealous of you.

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.000
If someone told me

00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:59.600
that you were stealing from me...

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.000
I won't do that.

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:05.400
So early.

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:08.750
We don't have food here for you.

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:10.670

Don't mention it.

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:13.670
My men are useless.

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:15.460
They lost them.

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:16.460
Don't worry.

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:18.600
I'll let you know if there's any news.

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:20.650
That's not important.

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:22.420
Let me give you some advice.

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.290

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:31.870
His name is Shun.

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.870
Shun.

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:34.480
I remember him.

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:35.840
When did he leave?

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:37.990
It was after Xubu Huai died.

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.080
Where was Shun

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:41.450
the night Xubu Huai died?

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:42.280
Young Mistress.

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:44.020
It rained heavily that night.

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.760
He said a wall in the garden had collapsed.

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:48.160
Shun went to repair the wall.

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:50.490
Shun is a little goofy,

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:51.610
just like my brother.

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.180
He went to repair the wall while it was raining.

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:55.110
Could it be repaired?

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:57.280
Show me.

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:03.080
This is it.

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:05.600
Go back to work.

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:06.230
Yes.

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:17.160
What's wrong?

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:24.050
If I'm right,

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:25.720
Xubu Huai's carriage

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:28.430
was behind that wall.

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:38.430
What's wrong with the roof?

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:40.990
I'm looking at the lightning column.

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:43.940
What's wrong with it?

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:47.380
All the big mansions in the city have these columns.

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:49.410
It's weird if they don't have it.

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:51.320
When it rains,

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:52.350
lightning strikes the roof.

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:56.160
The night Xubu Huai died,

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:59.380
someone tied an iron chain to the lightning column

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:02.170
and led it to Xubu Huai's carriage.

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:03.810
That explains

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:06.940
why lightning entered the carriage through the window.

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:09.670
It wasn't the lightning that killed Xubu Huai.

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:13.290
It was the iron chain.

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:15.460
These marks on the ground

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:17.400
are where the chain went.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:28.390

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:30.120

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:32.440
What do they want?

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:35.760

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:37.760

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:39.200
Yes.

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:41.930
We must go.

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:43.580
We will

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:44.640

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:48.810
Looks like Shun

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:51.140
didn't just let a dangerous man in.

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:52.280
Xubu Huai

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:53.880

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.520
It's not clear yet.

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:56.890
Don't jump to conclusions.

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:01.140
But

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:02.710
we can't explain why Xubu Huai

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:04.120
was at the door

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:05.440
of the Chamber of Commerce for no reason.

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:07.530
But one thing is certain.

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:10.900
Xubu Huai, Lei Juekun, and Hua Lei

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:12.800
were killed by the same people.

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:15.270
Why did they do that?

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:17.350
It doesn't matter

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:18.640
why they did it.

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:21.120
The Chamber of Commerce and the Ma Gang

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:22.470
are going to war.

00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:26.370
What if someone was trying to drive a wedge in your relationship?

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:28.520
Then, you don't have to go to war, right?

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:29.840
Young Mistress.

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:30.840
Don't you know?

00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:32.050
Last night,

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:34.130
seventeen warehouses of the Chamber of Commerce

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:35.330
caught fire.

00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:37.000
There's nothing left.

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:39.810
Chairman Li is furious.

00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:41.350
Didn't you notice

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:43.350
that there aren't many people in the Chamber of Commerce today?

00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:45.780
What does he want?

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:48.220
I'm not the Chairman.

00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:49.900
I don't know what he's going to do.

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:51.970
But it's not hard to guess.

00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:54.420
It's nothing more than a fight to death,

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:56.290

00:07:57.590 --> 00:07:59.390
All right. I have to go.

I'm glad you're here.

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:17.800
Is this the horse that pulled Xubu Huai's carriage

00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:28.800
Sir,

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:30.960
Ever since Xubu Huai died,

00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:33.040
the horse has been cranky.

00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:35.990
Maybe it was frightened by the death of its owner.

00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:40.260
Does it eat normally?

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:42.750
It ate more than usual.

00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:47.400
You are far worse than Sun Siming.

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:50.210
It moves bumpily,

00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:52.840
has white saliva in its mouth, and is cranky.

00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:55.760
It's not frightened

00:08:55.870 --> 00:08:57.300
by the death of its owner.

00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:00.620
It looks like a symptom

00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:02.160
of sudden withdrawal

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:03.570
after a long period of medication.

00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:04.840
As far as I know,

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:07.200
Tianyin Grass and mandragora

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:08.970
can cause this addiction.

00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:20.570
Its symptoms must have been caused

00:09:20.570 --> 00:09:21.800
by a long period of eating Tianyin Grass

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:23.130
and sudden withdrawal.

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:24.080
No way.

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:26.040
It only eats what I feed it.

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:27.400
It couldn't have eaten

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:28.560
Tianyin Grass.

00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:30.800
What if you have Tianyin Grass in your feed?

00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:31.400
I...

00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:32.750
I guess on weekdays,

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:35.560
I don't think

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:37.240
you cut grass and mix feed yourself.

00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:38.330
Yes, sir.

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:40.560
A groom took care of it.

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:44.200
But he disappeared.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:45.810
How do you know that?

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:50.080
After that, its feed

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:51.780
had no Tianyin Grass in it.

00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:53.920
That's why it has these symptoms.

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:54.750
No. But...

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:56.760
What did he do that?

00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:57.200
I...

00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:59.720
Because you raised this horse well.

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:02.300
It wouldn't go with a stranger

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:05.560
or eat anything from a stranger.

00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:08.730
Unless someone was holding something that it couldn't refuse

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:10.560
and lured it

00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:11.920
to the door of the Chamber of Commerce.

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:13.490
You...

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:18.160
Are you sure?

00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:20.990
Let's test it out.

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:24.680
Why are you bringing so many people?

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:26.040
Are You looking for a fight?

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:29.870
We can't decide it.

00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:33.710
If I can find the murderer,

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:35.710
will I be able to stop this war?

00:10:35.710 --> 00:10:36.840
It's too late.

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:38.400
The Chamber of Commerce came with troops.

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:40.280
The leader took men to fight them.

00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:43.830
We have proof.

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:46.700
Anyone with Tianyin Grass

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:47.910
can lead it away.

00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:50.830
It shows someone is driving a wedge in your relationship.

00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:52.350
The war

00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:53.870
has begun.

00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:15.870
Hurry up.

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:17.560
With Tianyin Grass as evidence,

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:19.350
we can stop them from going to war.

00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:24.350
Take it.

00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:32.580
[City God Temple]

00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:21.830
Who are you?

00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:26.590
Hulu.

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:28.060
Tell him.

00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:31.590
We are the Foundation.

00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:34.730
We protect the weak

00:13:34.830 --> 00:13:36.720
and uphold the good.

00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:38.160
Good.

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:41.160
Only we care about each other.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.000
You

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.830
are our oppressors.

00:13:44.830 --> 00:13:46.670
You don't understand it.

00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:50.120
Killing is illegal,

00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:53.360
even with a good excuse.

00:13:54.070 --> 00:13:55.820
They are people.

00:13:55.820 --> 00:13:56.500
Shut up.

00:13:57.640 --> 00:13:59.190
Did they care about us

00:13:59.190 --> 00:14:00.640
when they bullied us?

00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:03.020
The people at the top

00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:04.330
look nice.

00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:05.970
But they are evil inside.

00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:07.500
Which of them hasn't done anything bad?

00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:10.480
They all deserve to die.

00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:12.760
Go.

00:14:23.790 --> 00:14:24.430
Leader.

00:14:25.950 --> 00:14:26.950
Fu Sheng found out

00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:28.710
that there was something wrong with Xubu Huai's death.

00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:30.120
The Ma Gang

00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:31.480
and the Chamber of Commerce

00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:33.000
are set up.

00:14:33.830 --> 00:14:35.880
Fu Sheng will soon be herewith the evidence.

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:37.190
Evidence?

00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:38.590
Does it matter?

00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:40.920
Che.

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:42.780
I've known you for so many years.

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:45.140
You finally said something right.

00:14:45.470 --> 00:14:46.150
Tuoba.

00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:47.560
Take out your sword.

00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:49.560
Do what you have to do.

00:14:55.750 --> 00:14:56.600
Kill.

00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:57.440
Kill.

00:15:10.390 --> 00:15:12.570
You're twisted.

00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:16.490
You are worse than the people you hate.

00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:19.000
Don't pretend to be a good person.

00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:21.360
You're just enjoying

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:23.440
manipulating people.

00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:25.380
Whatever.

00:15:28.730 --> 00:15:30.210
Looks like

00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:32.460
you don't want me to leave alive.

00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:38.880
Because you're the closest to the truth.

00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:41.890
You should be the first victim.

00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:42.660
Right?

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:47.370
What else do you want to ask?

00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:48.880
I'm running out of time.

00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:51.160
How about

00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:52.450
I talk to you later?

00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:54.880
Yeah, you're running out of time.

00:15:58.510 --> 00:15:59.960
You're good at using needles.

00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:01.960
I have your medicine kit.

00:16:02.250 --> 00:16:03.930
What can you do?

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:06.720
I didn't say

00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:08.640
I was going to do something.

00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:11.700
Kill him.

00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:13.960
But

00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:15.370
Physician Fu is a good person.

00:16:15.370 --> 00:16:16.850
How can we kill good people?

00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:19.580
Yes, Physician Fu is a good person.

00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:20.700
Are you going to rebel?

00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:22.520
You still have good instincts.

00:16:22.970 --> 00:16:23.860
Good for you.

00:16:35.010 --> 00:16:35.850

00:16:45.550 --> 00:16:46.490

Thank you.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:51.540
You set me up.

00:16:52.270 --> 00:16:54.280
You insulted Hulu in public

00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:55.580
to lure me out.

00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:57.060
If I hadn't done that,

00:16:57.720 --> 00:16:59.080
I wouldn't have been able to find you.

00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:09.040
You don't have time.

00:17:09.790 --> 00:17:11.050
It's too late.

00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:14.460
There is a war in Xichuan.

00:17:40.550 --> 00:17:42.480
Help. Fire.

00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:45.390
No. We're trapped.

00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:47.360
Rush out.

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:49.270
There's no way back.

00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:51.400
Kill all of them.

[Xichuan]

00:18:02.270 --> 00:18:03.790
I'm afraid I'm going to let you down.

00:18:04.030 --> 00:18:05.110
I found you.

00:18:05.310 --> 00:18:06.880
I knew your means.

00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:09.190
I have to say,

00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:11.570
you hid well.

00:18:11.830 --> 00:18:12.750
But I have to tell you.

00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:16.030
If you don't want others to know, don't do it.

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:18.640
In Xubu Huai's case,

00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:20.920
the groom

00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:22.480
disappeared.

00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:24.550
After Hua Lei's death,

00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:27.920
the worker in the stable also disappeared.

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:29.880
The cook made mung bean soup

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.550
in the Lei's Mansion

00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:33.160
lost an apprentice.

00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:34.350
And

00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:37.640
the guy who stole the glass mirror from the pawn shop.

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:40.720
They have one thing in common.

00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:43.340
They are the people who live at the bottom

00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:44.800
and are bullied.

00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:48.310
A guy who was not sick went to me the other day.

00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:49.440
I concluded

00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:51.160
he was one of you.

00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:56.200
So, Hulu and I put on a play.

00:18:57.270 --> 00:18:58.200
Here is their plan.

00:18:58.550 --> 00:18:59.750
You got it so easily.

00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:00.880
At the end of the day,

00:19:01.030 --> 00:19:02.350
they are ordinary people.

00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:04.920
Their leader, Jia Xiaolong, is cautious.

00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:06.800
But the others can't control their excitement

00:19:06.830 --> 00:19:08.650
about doing this big thing.

00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:09.690
I talked to them

00:19:09.690 --> 00:19:11.130
and got them to tell me their tasks.

00:19:11.290 --> 00:19:13.320
It's not hard to figure out what they're going to do.

00:19:13.550 --> 00:19:14.330
Good boy.

00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:15.280
Good for you.

00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:18.330
I'll leave. In case they get suspicious.

00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:19.720
Stay safe.

00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:20.510
Okay.

00:19:21.590 --> 00:19:22.800
There's kerosene.

00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:24.070
They spent a lot of money.

00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:27.850
But it's effective.

00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:29.920
If we're not prepared,

00:19:30.550 --> 00:19:31.830
they are likely to succeed.

00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:33.270
It's all right.

00:19:34.550 --> 00:19:35.550
It's our turn.

00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:37.440
You're lying.

00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:39.800
Impossible.

00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:41.570
It's impossible.

00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:44.110
The Lord's Mansion is prepared.

00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:46.750
Gu Tian got a firefighting team

00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:48.920
patrolling.

00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:50.320
Hurry.

00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:56.270
You've known everything.

00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:58.680
Why are you only acting now?

00:20:01.070 --> 00:20:02.920
There has always been a grudge

00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:05.070
between the Ma Gang and the Chamber of Commerce.

00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:08.000
They wouldn't

00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:09.350
listen to my plan.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:11.160
After they see

00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:13.070
what you're doing,

00:20:13.550 --> 00:20:15.270
they'll listen to me.

00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:26.770
Kill me.

00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:30.030
They will torture me if they get me.

00:20:32.550 --> 00:20:33.240
You won't die.

00:20:34.550 --> 00:20:35.590
I can protect you.

00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:38.040
What are your terms?

00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:41.610
Nothing.

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:45.400
I want you to get back on the right path.

00:20:46.030 --> 00:20:47.030
I won't trust you

00:20:49.550 --> 00:20:51.010
without terms.

00:20:51.270 --> 00:20:52.070
Look at you.

00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:55.920
Tell me.

00:20:56.270 --> 00:20:57.440
What can I do to make you trust me?

00:21:10.790 --> 00:21:11.880
I have a friend.

00:21:12.350 --> 00:21:13.290
His name is Han Shuo.

00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:15.770
He was an ordinary man.

00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:17.980
He loved life.

00:21:18.830 --> 00:21:20.490
He wanted

00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:22.220
to live a good life in this city.

00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:24.350
But life is strange.

00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:27.400
He pawned his jade to Fuquan Pawn Shop.

00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:29.960
He wanted to redeem it

00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:31.310
after he made money.

00:21:32.310 --> 00:21:33.030
It's too bad.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.880
The Ma Gang and the Chamber of Commerce fought in the streets.

00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:38.840
An arrow killed him.

00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:40.590
Before he died,

00:21:41.310 --> 00:21:43.550
he asked me to redeem the jade.

00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:46.010
He said that if I got the other two pieces of jade,

00:21:46.010 --> 00:21:47.700
I would get the treasure.

00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:53.270
I've got the jade.

00:21:54.550 --> 00:21:56.240
It's about the Treasure of the Sealed Book.

00:21:56.750 --> 00:21:58.440
Keep it a secret.

00:21:58.750 --> 00:21:59.640
Mm.

00:22:03.070 --> 00:22:04.280
I asked people from the Foundation

00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:06.020
to look for it.

00:22:06.950 --> 00:22:08.500
Then, I realized

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:13.290
we don't need the treasure.

00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:16.250
As long as we stick together,

00:22:16.550 --> 00:22:18.690
we have that power.

00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:21.510
I don't need the treasure.

00:22:22.550 --> 00:22:23.200
But I know

00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:25.590
everybody wants it.

00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:30.650
I want to trade it for a promise.

00:22:31.510 --> 00:22:32.850
You can hand me over.

00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:35.120
But

00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:38.510
you have

00:22:38.510 --> 00:22:39.860
to keep them safe.

00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:43.400
- Xiaolong. - Xiaolong.

00:22:53.510 --> 00:22:54.270
I promise you.

00:23:02.350 --> 00:23:02.960
Put out the fire.

00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:31.590
Thanks, guys.

00:23:42.430 --> 00:23:43.840
Fu, look.

00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:07.360
How's it going?

00:24:08.350 --> 00:24:09.200
They went on a rampage.

00:24:09.510 --> 00:24:10.330
They are unstoppable.

00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:11.640
We have to separate them.

00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:13.680
Are you crazy?

00:24:21.090 --> 00:24:21.790
Stop.

00:24:27.070 --> 00:24:28.730
How did they get in there?

00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:31.790
Why are you going?

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:32.920
They're in danger.

00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:33.840
I have to save them.

00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:34.980
Nonsense.

00:24:35.030 --> 00:24:36.030
You can't save them

00:24:36.030 --> 00:24:37.410
with your skills.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:38.730
I...

00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:42.490
I can't save them, but you can.

00:24:43.110 --> 00:24:44.010
All right.

00:24:44.550 --> 00:24:45.840
It's our turn.

00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:46.590
Go.

00:24:53.590 --> 00:24:54.070
Stop.

00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:54.640
Stop.

00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:55.480
All of you, stop.

00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:57.030
Drop your weapons.

00:25:16.110 --> 00:25:17.070
He's finally working.

00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:26.200
Hulu, are you all right?

00:25:26.310 --> 00:25:26.790
I'm fine.

00:25:27.110 --> 00:25:29.440
Okay. Leave the rest to me.

00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:33.920
Everyone, please listen to me.

00:25:34.590 --> 00:25:36.930
You're fighting

00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:39.570
because some of your people died strangely.

00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:41.420
The Foundation people

00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:43.500
killed them.

00:25:43.590 --> 00:25:45.310
It has nothing to do with your enemy.

00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:51.040
In other words, you are all being used.

00:25:51.070 --> 00:25:53.090
What about

00:25:53.550 --> 00:25:54.350
my dead men?

00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:57.640
I won't let any people from the Chamber of Commerce go.

00:25:57.790 --> 00:25:59.590
If I can't wipe out the Ma Gang,

00:25:59.830 --> 00:26:01.510
I won't leave.

00:26:01.830 --> 00:26:03.030
Okay. Come on.

00:26:03.030 --> 00:26:03.750
Come on.

00:26:03.750 --> 00:26:05.310
You did the wrong thing. Stop it.

00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:12.270
If one of you makes a move,

00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:15.550
I'll join the other one.

00:26:22.590 --> 00:26:23.470
Do you still want to fight?

00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:26.170
Since Lord Wen said so,

00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:29.260
let Che say what to do.

00:26:30.590 --> 00:26:31.600
Coward.

00:26:32.830 --> 00:26:35.360
I don't want to embarrass Lord Wen.

00:26:37.310 --> 00:26:39.000
Guys, retreat.

00:26:39.590 --> 00:26:40.400
Ma Gang, let's go.

00:26:46.310 --> 00:26:47.160
Lord Wen.

00:26:47.790 --> 00:26:48.590
See you.

00:27:01.570 --> 00:27:02.620
You must be hungry.

00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:04.680
Come on. Eat something.

00:27:07.030 --> 00:27:08.650
After what you've done,

00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:10.890
all the shops were closed.

00:27:11.110 --> 00:27:13.100
I managed to get these dishes.

00:27:14.350 --> 00:27:15.680
I knew the two men in black

00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:18.350
were sent by you.

00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:20.560
The last time we met,

00:27:20.590 --> 00:27:22.000
you weren't that strong.

00:27:23.590 --> 00:27:24.960
There must be your men

00:27:25.590 --> 00:27:27.280
around me, right?

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:32.030
You should know

00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:33.550
that

00:27:34.350 --> 00:27:35.480
we are the same.

00:27:38.830 --> 00:27:40.160
You're willing to be a lackey.

00:27:40.790 --> 00:27:42.750
I want to be one of the upper class.

00:27:43.550 --> 00:27:44.960
We are different.

00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:50.340
Don't be delusional.

00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:52.270
No wonder you fell so hard this time.

00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:56.880
We're different.

00:27:57.480 --> 00:27:58.720
You're impatient.

00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:00.960
If you're as patient as I am,

00:28:01.270 --> 00:28:03.310
maybe you can achieve much more than I do in the future.

00:28:03.550 --> 00:28:04.110
Come on.

00:28:04.550 --> 00:28:05.350
Let's talk about it over dinner.

00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:08.380
I think

00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:10.240
the Foundation is good.

00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:15.170
But in my opinion,

00:28:16.110 --> 00:28:17.140
your organization

00:28:17.140 --> 00:28:18.360
has more people, right?

00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:22.200
I'm right.

00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:24.750
Don't be afraid.

00:28:25.350 --> 00:28:26.550
I won't tell anyone.

00:28:26.550 --> 00:28:27.720
It's our secret.

00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:29.270
We'll work together in the future.

00:28:29.790 --> 00:28:31.810
The stronger you are, the more you'll help me.

00:28:31.830 --> 00:28:33.960
Maybe I can help you make your wish come true.

00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:35.240
I won't cooperate with you.

00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:42.270
I thought we were already working together.

00:28:43.030 --> 00:28:43.640
All right.

00:28:44.270 --> 00:28:45.240
Let's talk about it over dinner.

00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:47.400
How about

00:28:48.070 --> 00:28:49.200
the thing

00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:50.310
I asked you to find?

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:56.920
To be honest,

00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:00.610
I didn't

00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:02.830
look for it.

00:29:07.110 --> 00:29:08.450
Sun Siming.

00:29:09.110 --> 00:29:10.510
Let me tell you what I know.

00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:14.960
I know it's important to you.

00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:16.590
I also know

00:29:16.590 --> 00:29:18.830
that Li Zhizhuo asked you to find it.

00:29:18.830 --> 00:29:19.720
And I know

00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:22.000
that you'll suffer if you can't find it.

00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:26.790
So...

00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:30.220
I won't die alone.

00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:33.770
I'll be waiting for you over there.

00:29:34.830 --> 00:29:37.350
You're just a lowly horse slave.

00:29:37.350 --> 00:29:38.160
Don't try to move up.

00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:40.880
You're just a pet.

00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:52.440
These dishes

00:29:53.830 --> 00:29:55.260
are wasted.

00:29:57.590 --> 00:29:58.450
You're right.

00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:02.200
How can a pet help you?

00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:04.810
Looks like

00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:07.160
this is the only thing

00:30:07.790 --> 00:30:09.020
that can help you.

00:30:11.830 --> 00:30:13.070
You don't have to work with me.

00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:14.920
Dream on.

00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:26.030
Look.

00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:28.440
I said I could make your wish come true.

00:30:37.250 --> 00:30:38.450
What do you want to see me about?

00:30:38.730 --> 00:30:39.740
Have you figured out

00:30:39.740 --> 00:30:41.490
how to prove that you didn't kill Master Lin?

00:30:45.810 --> 00:30:46.520
Yes.

00:30:47.110 --> 00:30:47.960
How?

00:30:48.590 --> 00:30:50.290
I'll tie Li Zhizhuo up

00:30:50.930 --> 00:30:52.130
and send him to you.

00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:53.800
You can ask him in person.

00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:54.980
What do you think?

00:30:56.480 --> 00:30:57.060
Okay.

00:30:58.160 --> 00:30:59.400
I hope

00:30:59.830 --> 00:31:01.240
you won't let me down again.

00:31:04.740 --> 00:31:07.980
[Lord's Mansion]

00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:09.450
I didn't expect

00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:12.090
a group of humble underclass men

00:31:12.350 --> 00:31:14.050
to do such a big thing.

00:31:15.310 --> 00:31:17.580
They almost ruined Xichuan.

00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:21.320
Looks like

00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:24.520
I was too easy on those guys.

00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:26.360
If it weren't for Fu Sheng,

00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:28.150
those guys

00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:30.150
would have

00:31:30.150 --> 00:31:30.950
overturned you big names.

00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:33.470
Young Mistress, you're right.

00:31:34.520 --> 00:31:35.040
Mr. Fu.

00:31:35.950 --> 00:31:37.150
No words can express my thanks.

00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:40.230
Chairman Li.

00:31:40.710 --> 00:31:41.840
You can thank him with action.

00:31:42.390 --> 00:31:44.120
Thank him by giving him jewelry or antiques.

00:31:44.430 --> 00:31:45.190
The more, the better.

00:31:46.470 --> 00:31:47.080
You're right.

00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:50.230
Mr. Fu

00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:52.190
saved my men.

00:31:53.150 --> 00:31:54.390
I can't thank him enough.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:31:58.630
Mr. Fu.

00:31:59.190 --> 00:32:00.190
Come to the Ma Gang tomorrow.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.560
If you want anything, just ask me.

00:32:04.470 --> 00:32:04.950
Che.

00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:06.470
You're generous.

00:32:08.390 --> 00:32:09.440
Actually,

00:32:09.710 --> 00:32:10.630
I have

00:32:10.870 --> 00:32:12.090
a favor to ask you.

00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:13.600
Mr. Fu, what can we do?

00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:15.870
About those Foundation members we caught,

00:32:16.230 --> 00:32:17.190
they did

00:32:17.470 --> 00:32:18.190
the wrong thing.

00:32:19.190 --> 00:32:22.080
But they come from poor families.

00:32:22.230 --> 00:32:23.190
They are deluded.

00:32:24.190 --> 00:32:25.670
If you are okay with it,

00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:28.120
please leave them

00:32:28.390 --> 00:32:29.230
to me.

00:32:30.190 --> 00:32:33.040
Mr. Fu, what are you going to do with them?

00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:35.390
I had an idea.

00:32:36.280 --> 00:32:38.080
I'll let them work for my clinic

00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:39.280
as herb gathers.

00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:42.560
If they can change their minds

00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:44.080
and learn medical skills,

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:45.910
it would be a good thing

00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:47.360
for Xichuan.

00:32:48.430 --> 00:32:50.470
Thank you for your kindness.

00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:53.000
The clinic is in your territory.

00:32:54.190 --> 00:32:55.760
That's good for you.

00:32:57.080 --> 00:32:57.870
Li Zhizhuo.

00:32:58.600 --> 00:33:00.040
Accept it.

00:33:00.390 --> 00:33:01.870
That's just good character paying off.

00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:03.840
Mr. Fu is kind.

00:33:04.470 --> 00:33:07.150
No matter where the clinic is,

00:33:07.630 --> 00:33:09.360
it is the people of Xichuan who benefit.

00:33:10.910 --> 00:33:11.600
Chairman Li,

00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:12.870
you're thinking too much.

00:33:14.190 --> 00:33:14.910
In that case,

00:33:15.710 --> 00:33:16.320
I agree

00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:17.470
with Mr. Fu's proposal.

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.120
I'll leave them to you.

00:33:20.430 --> 00:33:21.080
But I can only

00:33:21.870 --> 00:33:22.870
leave the accessories to you.

00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:24.600
I won't let the main culprit go.

00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:26.280
Otherwise,

00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:27.630
we can't explain it

00:33:27.630 --> 00:33:28.950
to the families of the deceased.

00:33:30.040 --> 00:33:32.230
The main culprit, Jia Xiaolong, committed a series of crimes.

00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:34.520
I have issued a wanted warrant.

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:35.870
What do you think?

00:33:42.710 --> 00:33:43.800
The Jibei Chamber of Commerce reported

00:33:44.150 --> 00:33:46.670
that Jia Xiaolong had sneaked into Sun Siming's home

00:33:47.390 --> 00:33:48.360
and had been found by Sun Siming.

00:33:48.630 --> 00:33:49.870
During their fight,

00:33:49.870 --> 00:33:51.320
Sun Siming killed Jia Xiaolong

00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:53.190
to protect himself.

00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:00.470
Since the main culprit is dead,

00:34:01.670 --> 00:34:03.080
if there is no objection,

00:34:03.870 --> 00:34:04.800
let's

00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:07.040
close this case.

00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:09.830
There are a lot of talents in the Chamber of Commerce.

00:34:10.830 --> 00:34:12.960
A carriage steward

00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:15.270
killed a culprit in close combat.

00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:17.150
He's not simple.

00:34:17.150 --> 00:34:19.790
I don't think he's better

00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:21.190
than men in your Ma Gang.

00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:24.150
My man is lucky.

00:34:24.630 --> 00:34:25.560
He took the merit.

00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:27.270
What?

00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:29.310
Are you jealous?

00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:30.040
Don't say that.

00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:32.040
I'm not jealous.

00:34:33.230 --> 00:34:34.880
We don't know

00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:36.400
what really happened.

00:34:36.790 --> 00:34:38.230
I just wanted to remind you

00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:40.710
that carriage steward

00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:41.960
is not simple

00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:43.790
and can be of great use.

00:34:44.670 --> 00:34:45.400
Come on.

00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:48.480
Let's toast Chairman Li

00:34:48.710 --> 00:34:49.630
and congratulate him on getting a talented man.

00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:52.000
Cheers.

00:34:53.710 --> 00:34:54.350
Let's

00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:56.080
make a toast.

00:34:56.440 --> 00:34:57.120
Cheers.

[Wenfu Hall]

00:35:13.230 --> 00:35:14.960
The Ma Gang and the Chamber of Commerce have promised me

00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:17.120
to let it go.

00:35:17.350 --> 00:35:18.150
So,

00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:19.480
think of it as a dream.

00:35:24.150 --> 00:35:24.790
Did we

00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:26.600
do the wrong thing?

00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:28.880
You were right

00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:31.220
to want to fight Jia Xiaolong.

00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:34.000
Read more books so you can be reasonable.

00:35:34.710 --> 00:35:35.540
Later, everyone,

00:35:35.790 --> 00:35:37.120
If you can't tell right from wrong,

00:35:37.710 --> 00:35:38.310
read books.

00:35:39.150 --> 00:35:39.630
Well.

00:35:45.670 --> 00:35:46.270
Great.

I've only scratched the surface.

00:35:53.790 --> 00:35:54.830
What are you mumbling about?

00:36:01.880 --> 00:36:02.920
Do you want to be my apprentice?

00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:03.960
Yes.

00:36:04.790 --> 00:36:05.400
I accept you.

Three sovereigns and five emperors are heroes.

00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:32.600
In the Spring and Autumn Period, there were many talents.

00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:36.480
Five Hegemons fought for territory.

00:36:36.710 --> 00:36:38.880
Who among the young heroes

of Xichuan truly stands out?

00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:43.830
Bravo.

00:36:46.190 --> 00:36:48.080
Some time ago,

00:36:49.190 --> 00:36:51.440
it was rumored

00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:53.520
that I, Fang Zhiyuan,

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:56.440
kept a ghost

00:36:56.750 --> 00:37:00.080
and sent it to kill people.

00:37:00.630 --> 00:37:02.960
I suffered from it.

00:37:03.630 --> 00:37:07.400
Physician Fu and Young Hero Gu

00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:09.520
fought the ghosts

00:37:09.630 --> 00:37:13.150
and cleared my name.

talk about the past, only the present.

00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:22.830
I'll talk

00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:26.080
about the rising stars of Xichuan.

Yeah.

00:37:34.530 --> 00:37:35.480
It's weird.

00:37:37.870 --> 00:37:38.750
I should ask Wen Yu

00:37:38.930 --> 00:37:40.920
to cut him.

00:37:42.630 --> 00:37:43.120
Okay.

Wait.

Why are you arresting me again?

00:37:53.750 --> 00:37:55.310
I'm just a storyteller.

Today is the last time you tell a story here.

What did I do?

00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:10.670
You have a good relationship with the city lord.

00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:13.350
But you shouldn't bully me.

00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:15.400
- Yeah. - He's right. Physician Fu.

I'll explain it to you.

You must have heard

00:38:30.670 --> 00:38:33.440
that the murderer wasn't the storyteller's ghost

00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:35.560
but the members of the Foundation.

Yeah.

that Fang Zhiyuan is also a member of the Foundation.

00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:45.630
Him?

00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:47.120
He's a member of the Foundation?

00:38:47.310 --> 00:38:47.830
He doesn't look like it.

00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:49.560
You said I was one of them.

00:38:49.790 --> 00:38:51.710
Do you have proof?

00:38:52.150 --> 00:38:53.750
Mr. Fang, you're good at acting.

00:38:54.790 --> 00:38:55.750
You fooled everyone,

00:38:55.750 --> 00:38:57.350
including me, at the beginning.

00:38:57.920 --> 00:39:00.080
The day the Three Heroes of Xichuan came to make trouble,

00:39:01.560 --> 00:39:03.270
you changed your story

00:39:03.630 --> 00:39:05.040
to be about them.

00:39:05.790 --> 00:39:06.600
Since then,

00:39:07.830 --> 00:39:09.270
I've been suspicious of you.

00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:12.270
The Three Heroes of Xichuan haven't done anything bad.

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:15.230
They are not heroes

00:39:15.350 --> 00:39:16.440
or dignitaries.

00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:20.630
They don't fit your story.

00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:24.270
I did it to scare them.

00:39:24.270 --> 00:39:26.150
I wanted to scare them off.

00:39:26.440 --> 00:39:28.150
I said the same thing to you out of it.

00:39:28.830 --> 00:39:30.920
When I met Jia Xiaolong,

00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:33.670
I asked him the same thing.

00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:35.750
Guess what he said.

00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:37.830
What did he say?

00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:40.000
Mr. Fang.

00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:42.790
Why didn't you ask me

00:39:43.310 --> 00:39:44.520
who Jia Xiaolong is?

00:39:46.710 --> 00:39:47.230
I...

00:39:47.350 --> 00:39:49.670
I'm following your lead.

00:39:51.480 --> 00:39:53.120
Here's what Jia Xiaolong told me.

00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:55.630
You said

00:39:56.190 --> 00:39:58.350
you killed people who did bad things.

00:39:58.670 --> 00:39:59.270
Let me ask you.

00:39:59.950 --> 00:40:02.400
The Three Heroes of Xichuan haven't done anything bad.

00:40:03.030 --> 00:40:04.400
Why did you kill them?

00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:06.310
I don't care what they did.

00:40:07.750 --> 00:40:09.600
Mr. Fang mentioned them.

00:40:10.270 --> 00:40:11.310
If they don't die,

00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:14.520
Mr. Fang will lose his prestige.

00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:16.960
They provoked Mr. Fang in public.

00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:19.190
They have to pay for their actions.

00:40:19.810 --> 00:40:20.820
This is to punish

00:40:20.820 --> 00:40:22.730
more bad guys in the future.

00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:26.000
Fang Zhiyuan is your man.

00:40:27.970 --> 00:40:29.930
Too bad I don't have anything on him.

00:40:32.630 --> 00:40:34.440
There is nothing new under the sun.

00:40:35.080 --> 00:40:36.350
If he wasn't one of us,

00:40:36.350 --> 00:40:37.830
why would he

00:40:37.830 --> 00:40:39.440
talk about the people we wanted to kill?

00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:44.560
That's right.

00:40:46.270 --> 00:40:48.040
I am a member of the Foundation.

00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:51.080
The existence of the Foundation

00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:54.630
is to make Xichuan peaceful.

00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:56.310
Now Xichuan

00:40:56.480 --> 00:40:58.830
is a mess.

00:40:59.410 --> 00:41:00.600
Wait for it.

00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:02.920
You'll regret it.

00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:04.710
Nonsense. Take him away.
