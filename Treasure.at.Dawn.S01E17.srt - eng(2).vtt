00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:06.270
Look, you scared all my fish away.

00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:08.610
Why did you ask Jiu to arrest Fang Zhiyuan?

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:10.450
Are you being foolish?

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:11.560
Fang Zhiyuan

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:13.080
is old and weak,

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:14.930
so he must not be the real killer.

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:16.380
Jue, come on.

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:18.300
Look at the fish in the pond.

00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:22.870
The big fish eat the small fish, and the small fish eat the mud.

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:24.560
They kill each other every day,

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:26.110
so do you know

00:09:26.510 --> 00:09:27.990
how we can quell this fight?

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:30.230
We just have to eat the big fish.

00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:32.400
That's right,

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:33.960
but not totally right.

00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:36.380
The only way to quell this fight

00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:39.880
is to equalize the size of the fish

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:41.870
in order to get peace

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:43.320
and tranquility.

00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:45.140
Is that different from what I said?

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:45.940
Why am I wrong?

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:49.040
The key is not to keep the big fish or the small fish

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:50.510
but the balance.

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:52.140
As long as the balance is achieved,

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:54.200
even if the small fish are eaten and the big fish survive,

00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:56.040
the effect will be the same.

00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:04.680
But what does this have to do with Fang Zhiyuan?

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:06.970
Balance is only the first step.

00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:09.350
Even if the size of the fish is the same,

00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:11.690
you will find that in a short time,

00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:13.820
they will still be fighting each other.

00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:16.280
Do you know why?

00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:19.560
They are equal in strength,

00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:21.870
but there is a limited amount of fish food,

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:24.100
and each fish receives unequal food,

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:26.230
so the balance will naturally be upset.

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:29.960
You're smart, Jue.

00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:31.200
That's right.

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:31.870
Come on.

00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:38.320
Now, the Three Heroes of Xichuan died bizarrely.

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:39.680
So far,

00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:42.400
there have been four murders

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:43.400
and six deaths in Xichuan,

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:47.990
involving the Chamber of Commerce, Ma Gang, wealthy merchants, and bandits.

00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:50.320
The forces that were in balance

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:52.960
have gone to war because of the chaos

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:54.710
created by a storyteller.

00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:57.320
If we can't find the truth in time,

00:10:58.230 --> 00:11:00.590
how can we quell the civil disorder?

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:02.990
We can't stand by and watch them

00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:04.470
fight to the death

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:07.960
and spill over to the innocent people.

00:11:10.590 --> 00:11:11.470
Fish food

00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:14.920
is just a reason to fight.

00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:18.830
So, father, you know he's not the real killer,

00:11:20.110 --> 00:11:21.830
but you just want the fish food back

00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:23.610
so that the source of the chaos disappears, right?

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:28.560
This is the way of balance

00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:31.040
and the only way for Lord's Mansion

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:35.080
to protect the people in the midst of multiple forces.

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:38.720
You're wrong.

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:40.600
Even if Fang Zhiyuan is gone,

00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:41.900
they can create other similar people

00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:44.470
to make a reason to fight

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:47.510
as long as they want,

00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:49.920
but Fang Zhiyuan, as the people of Xichuan,

00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:51.440
should be protected by Lord's Mansion.

00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:53.440
As the next Lord,

00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:55.400
I cannot sit back and watch

00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:56.710
Fang Zhiyuan die a worthless death.

00:11:59.040 --> 00:11:59.440
Jue.

00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:03.560
I'm impressed with you today.

00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:04.960
Come on. Tell me.

00:12:05.510 --> 00:12:06.280
What do you want?

00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:08.870
I have two demands.

00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:09.920
First,

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:11.200
release Fang Zhiyuan.

00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:12.230
Second,

00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:13.800
give me ten days

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:15.040
to get this done.

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:19.680
Tomorrow.

00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:22.200
I'll find a reason to release Fang Zhiyuan tomorrow,

00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:25.040
but I'll only give you seven days

00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:27.630
because you're my daughter.

00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:29.870
After seven days, if you can't do it,

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:33.200
I'll order Fang Zhiyuan to be killed.

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:35.440
I can only warn the people

00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:37.080
by solving the trouble

00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:40.350
with such cruelty.

00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:54.630
I told you not to be so high-profile,

00:12:55.590 --> 00:12:57.630
but you've still gotten yourselves into trouble.

00:12:58.990 --> 00:13:00.160
You've worked with me for so long,

00:13:00.830 --> 00:13:02.580
but why haven't you learned

00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:03.230
any of my wisdom?

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:12.160
I value friendship.

00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:14.680
Since you've worked with me,

00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:17.630
you needn't worry about running out of wine at every festival.

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:37.470
Fu Sheng.

00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:38.590
Look at this.

00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:44.540
Hey.

00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:46.750
Are you gonna put it in your mouth again?

00:13:48.750 --> 00:13:49.470
It's knockout drops.

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:54.560
Who served the wine?

00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:56.810
A maid named Cui.

00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:57.400
Where is she?

00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:02.280
She was here a moment ago.

00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:04.350
Cui.

00:14:04.630 --> 00:14:05.830
Cui, why are you running?

00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:06.320
After her.

00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:11.510
Wen Jue.

00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:12.680
We were just here,

00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:13.540
but why did you leave again?

00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:15.000
There's a girl

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:15.780
in pink named Cui.

00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:16.510
We must find her.

00:14:16.510 --> 00:14:16.830
Okay.

00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:26.470
We can't go after her like this.

00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:27.960
Let's split up.

00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:29.110
You guys go over there.

00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:29.680
OK.

00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:30.320
You guys go over there.

00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:31.560
Fu Sheng, come with me.

00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:46.510
What's going on?

00:14:46.830 --> 00:14:48.080
Why are there so many Cui suddenly?

00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:50.320
She replicated herself

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:51.680
and hired a few people to impersonate her.

00:14:52.110 --> 00:14:52.800
What now?

00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:54.250
We'd rather catch the wrong person than let them go.

00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:54.920
Split up and chase her.

00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:08.160
Get out of the way.

00:15:30.870 --> 00:15:31.470
Stop right there!

00:15:35.710 --> 00:15:36.680
You killed an innocent man.

00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:37.680
This is a capital offense.

00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:38.920
Surrender now.

00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:49.320
You're hurt.

00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:50.750
I'll take you to the clinic.

00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:51.920
Let's go.

00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:57.870
Okay.

00:15:58.400 --> 00:15:59.470
Okay.

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:02.320
Pervert.

00:16:02.630 --> 00:16:06.040
Someone molested me

00:16:07.710 --> 00:16:08.470
in broad daylight.

00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:13.580
[Wenfu Hall]

00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:14.890
I'm going to take out the arrow.

00:16:15.470 --> 00:16:16.110
Hold it.

00:16:19.830 --> 00:16:20.320
Hold it.

00:16:25.590 --> 00:16:26.230
Don't move.

00:16:40.830 --> 00:16:41.560
How is she?

00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:42.640
She's fine,

00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:44.680
but she can't fight in a few days.

00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:45.800
Help her rest over there.

00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:46.630
Come on.

00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:47.590
Be careful.

00:16:53.510 --> 00:16:54.750
What do you think about the escaped Cui?

00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:57.510
We were splitting up to track her today,

00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:00.160
but we all ran into different kinds of trouble on the way,

00:17:01.230 --> 00:17:02.710
so we must have missed something during that.

00:17:04.070 --> 00:17:04.550
For example,

00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:08.990
what kind of person do you think would kill someone?

00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:10.840
Anyone

00:17:11.470 --> 00:17:12.470
could do that.

00:17:13.030 --> 00:17:14.160
That's the problem.

00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:17.200
We all thought that anyone

00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:18.920
who could commit such a big crime

00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:20.270
must not be an ordinary person,

00:17:21.550 --> 00:17:22.790
but we were wrong.

00:17:23.030 --> 00:17:25.600
Anyone could have done it.

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:28.440
We can't go on like this.

00:17:28.990 --> 00:17:30.920
We can't keep being led by the nose.

00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:35.840
I have an idea.

00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:43.710
I've always hated those of you

00:17:43.710 --> 00:17:44.880
who run pawn shops.

00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:47.440
Other people have credibility,

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:49.200
but you guys

00:17:50.030 --> 00:17:51.600
are always bullying.

00:17:58.550 --> 00:17:59.200
He has something to say.

00:18:00.030 --> 00:18:01.400
These pawn shop owners

00:18:01.510 --> 00:18:02.690
never tell the truth,

00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:04.840
so I've got to make him think twice.

00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:07.680
Give me another one.

00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:21.030
Not challenging.

00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:27.030
It's a lot more fun.

00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:44.750
Boring.

00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:51.550
Sir.

00:18:52.270 --> 00:18:53.400
I checked your ledgers.

00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:56.880
That gold frame glass mirror

00:18:57.440 --> 00:18:58.960
only cost you 800 coins,

00:18:59.750 --> 00:19:01.120
which isn't even enough for a goat.

00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:05.030
The merchant, however desperate for money,

00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:07.120
could not have sold it for so little.

00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:15.200
I'll say. I'll say it all.

00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:16.640
Those things

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:17.990
are stolen.

00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:20.550
Everyone in Xichuan has different skills.

00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:22.180
Is a piece of stolen property

00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:23.120
worth hiding?

00:19:24.030 --> 00:19:26.400
How could someone making Night Owl do this

00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:28.600
be an ordinary person?

00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:30.680
I'm just afraid

00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:32.380
of getting in trouble.

00:19:33.030 --> 00:19:34.070
Still lying to me?

00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:35.880
I'm not.

00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:36.980
Night Owl

00:19:37.340 --> 00:19:39.060
sold that thing for only 800 coins?

00:19:39.230 --> 00:19:40.030
Is he stupid

00:19:40.030 --> 00:19:41.160
or am I?

00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:42.120
He didn't sell it.

00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:43.710
His apprentice did.

00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:44.600
His apprentice.

00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:45.880
His apprentice?

00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:46.930
Are you sure?

00:19:47.230 --> 00:19:47.840
Yes.

00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:51.400
His apprentice knows an employee

00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:51.790
of my shop

00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:53.200
and has pawned

00:19:53.230 --> 00:19:54.600
a lot of stuff for Night Owl.

00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:55.630
That's him.

00:19:56.710 --> 00:19:57.460
When he

00:19:57.710 --> 00:19:58.880
brought that item in,

00:19:59.270 --> 00:20:00.310
I knew at a glance

00:20:00.550 --> 00:20:01.690
he had it stashed away,

00:20:01.990 --> 00:20:02.610
so

00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:05.490
I made a lowball offer in bad conscience.

00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:08.700
Stop right there.

00:20:15.070 --> 00:20:16.070
What about that employee?

00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:17.520
I kicked him out

00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:18.880
after the warehouse burned down.

00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:26.710
What's wrong?

00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:28.860
No wonder that glass mirror was placed

00:20:29.030 --> 00:20:31.550
right where direct sunlight could reach it

00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:33.750
and that it so coincidentally ignited the silk cloth.

00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:35.540
I'll inform Fu Sheng.

00:20:35.710 --> 00:20:36.680
You go to Wen Jue.

00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:38.600
Fu Sheng's suspicions were right.

00:20:38.990 --> 00:20:39.840
Okay, let's go.

00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:45.120
Oh, my God.

00:20:53.230 --> 00:20:54.470
Young Mistress.

00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:56.880
Madam has no desire to see guests today.

00:20:57.400 --> 00:20:58.400
Please forgive her.

00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:01.880
This is the cook you were looking for.

00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:04.510
You're alive. That's great.

00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:05.960
I thought you'd been killed

00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:07.650
by the Lei family to vent their anger.

00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:09.920
Young Mistress, it was my fault.

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:11.680
Luckily, Madam was generous enough

00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:13.310
to spare my life.

00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:16.120
We are not murderous people,

00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:17.500
and Master's death

00:21:18.030 --> 00:21:19.560
was God's will.

00:21:20.030 --> 00:21:21.280
He did it unintentionally.

00:21:21.790 --> 00:21:23.860
He was not at fault.

00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:25.890
God's will?

00:21:26.750 --> 00:21:27.640
Now it's not, I'm afraid.

00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:30.120
Young Mistress, what do you mean?

00:21:31.030 --> 00:21:32.990
Mr. Lei's death was indeed a coincidence,

00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:34.470
but now we suspect

00:21:34.470 --> 00:21:35.750
that all these coincidences are man-made.

00:21:36.510 --> 00:21:37.710
We are checking them one by one.

00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:41.790
For example, when the caravan

00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:43.710
returned that day,

00:21:44.350 --> 00:21:45.630
why did you happen to prepare

00:21:45.630 --> 00:21:46.760
so much green bean soup?

00:21:47.150 --> 00:21:48.150
As far as I know,

00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:50.550
mung beans need to be soaked for an hour in advance

00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:51.870
and then be simmered for two quarters.

00:21:52.310 --> 00:21:54.040
Plus the time to let it cool,

00:21:54.590 --> 00:21:55.390
you need to prepare it

00:21:55.870 --> 00:21:58.040
at least two hours in advance in total.

00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:00.070
I...

00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:01.040
Tell me.

00:22:02.590 --> 00:22:03.040
Young Mistress.

00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:04.760
I really had nothing to do with this.

00:22:05.310 --> 00:22:06.630
I just saw the assistant Dou

00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:07.630
making a big pot

00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:09.350
of green bean soup the other day.

00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:10.760
I asked him what it was for.

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:12.390
He said he'd heard that Master

00:22:12.390 --> 00:22:13.550
was trapped near the fire,

00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:14.280
so he wanted

00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:15.790
to make soup for Master to relieve the heat.

00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:17.760
I just...

00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:19.240
So you took credit for his work

00:22:20.390 --> 00:22:22.960
but didn't realize what you got

00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:24.900
was the poison used to kill people.

00:22:25.350 --> 00:22:25.960
But

00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:27.550
how did Dou know

00:22:27.550 --> 00:22:28.790
we were trapped in the fire?

00:22:29.670 --> 00:22:30.790
Master didn't send anyone to report

00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:32.350
in order to keep Madam from worrying.

00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:34.070
Just ask him.

00:22:35.870 --> 00:22:37.240
Where is Dou? Tell me.

00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:40.130
He disappeared

00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:42.370
after Master's accident.

00:22:42.650 --> 00:22:43.320
This...

00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:49.090
If Fu Sheng guessed correctly,

00:22:49.810 --> 00:22:52.110
the dog meat vendor you met on the street

00:22:54.110 --> 00:22:55.550
may also be an inconspicuous person.

00:22:58.830 --> 00:22:59.460
Yes.

00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:08.900
Sir.

00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:11.100
Spare me.

00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:12.900
It's not my fault.

00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:14.210
Please.

00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:18.560
It's not my fault.

00:23:20.070 --> 00:23:21.440
Wake up.

00:23:22.070 --> 00:23:22.680
Wake up.

00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:32.390
Where's Ye Shiliu?

00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:36.720
I deserve to die.

00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:38.350
The food brought at night

00:23:38.830 --> 00:23:39.630
was tampered with.

00:23:40.110 --> 00:23:41.630
We've all been tricked.

00:23:42.310 --> 00:23:43.070
I'm afraid Ye Shiliu

00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:44.920
has been taken away.

00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:47.070
This is a deliberate attempt to cut off the clues

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:49.590
and prevent me from investigating.

00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:54.890
All the clues have been cut off.

Okay.

such good herbs, aren't you?

00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:04.310
It's just some worthless dried tangerine peel.

00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:06.440
Worthless dried tangerine peel?

00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:41.350
to spend your life here as a slave?

00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:43.390
I...

00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:46.660
Hulu.

Join us.

00:27:48.390 --> 00:27:49.960
We can give you what you want.

00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:52.690
What can you give me?

00:27:53.150 --> 00:27:54.640
Understanding and dignity.

00:28:15.870 --> 00:28:16.240
Wait a minute.

00:28:16.590 --> 00:28:18.720
You said you'd give me understanding and dignity,

00:28:18.870 --> 00:28:20.830
but you're all so secretive

00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:22.520
and hide your identities.

00:28:22.790 --> 00:28:23.070
You...

00:28:23.070 --> 00:28:23.480
So

00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:25.390
how can I feel comfortable joining you?

00:28:25.870 --> 00:28:27.240
We want you to join us

00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:29.790
because you're one of us

00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:33.310
who's been ignored, discriminated against,

00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:35.280
abused, and stepped on,

00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:37.390
like the most insignificant

00:28:37.630 --> 00:28:39.240
and useless stone in the road.

00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:43.800
What can a bunch of stones do?

00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:46.130
Stones can become a foundation

00:28:46.710 --> 00:28:48.400

00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:50.790
or subvert a city.

00:28:51.310 --> 00:28:53.920
What are you going to do?

00:28:54.230 --> 00:28:56.860
Xichuan should have belonged to people,

00:28:57.120 --> 00:28:59.770
but those in power and rich merchants have taken over Xichuan

00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:00.470
and reduced us,

00:29:00.470 --> 00:29:02.970
who have worked the hardest, to slaves.

00:29:03.470 --> 00:29:04.520
Are you happy with that?

00:29:05.230 --> 00:29:06.120
Are you willing?

00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:07.780
No.

00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:08.920
That's why

00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:10.840
we'll take revenge on them

00:29:11.070 --> 00:29:11.940
and drive them out.

00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:13.600
So we can live here

00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:14.940
with dignity.

00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:21.360
Hulu.

00:29:22.030 --> 00:29:23.260
When you complete the trials

00:29:23.260 --> 00:29:24.840
and officially become a member of the Foundation,

00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:26.960
you'll know who we are.

00:29:27.710 --> 00:29:28.360
And by then,

00:29:29.470 --> 00:29:31.640
you'll be able to do everything you want too.

00:29:31.750 --> 00:29:33.930
What do you want me to do?

00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:35.470
Hulu.

00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:39.400
Do you find it interesting that an investigator

00:29:41.510 --> 00:29:42.880
becomes a murderer?

00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:44.270
What...

00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:45.840
What do you want to do?

00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:02.070
If I were a murderer,

00:30:02.310 --> 00:30:03.120
you'd already be dead.

00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:07.880
You know something's wrong,

00:30:07.990 --> 00:30:09.030
but why would you still fall?

00:30:09.710 --> 00:30:12.270
Only by being prepared can we reduce our strength in time.

00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:15.750
In haste, a man is bound to fall.

00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:22.400
How's that?

00:30:24.790 --> 00:30:25.640
Look at this.

00:30:28.990 --> 00:30:30.130
It's the light

00:30:30.290 --> 00:30:31.570
that spooked the horses.

00:30:47.750 --> 00:30:49.270
This is it.

00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:56.050
Why is there a sword formation here?

00:30:56.200 --> 00:30:57.090
The other day,

00:30:57.400 --> 00:30:59.160
the bell was ringing for no reason.

00:30:59.550 --> 00:31:00.420
We had looked into it for long

00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:01.810
but couldn't find out the reason.

00:31:02.270 --> 00:31:04.220
Then we invited an immortal

00:31:04.470 --> 00:31:05.540
to set up this sword formation

00:31:05.790 --> 00:31:06.510
to ward off evil spirits.

00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:07.730
Then

00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:09.030
it never rang again.

00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:10.920
Immortal?

00:31:11.470 --> 00:31:12.920
I don't think you're telling the truth.

00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:16.270
It's not Eight Trigrams or Nine Palaces,

00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:18.680
and it's not even an unpresentable Seven Luminaries.

00:31:19.270 --> 00:31:20.470
The number's wrong.

00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:22.860
The only thing it does

00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:25.880
is totally reflect the sunlight

00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:28.050
through this mirror

00:31:28.230 --> 00:31:29.550
in the alley where Hua Lei died.

00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:41.600
This...

00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:44.650
Everything I said is true.

00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:45.400
And

00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:47.510
I've reported all the expenses

00:31:47.790 --> 00:31:50.200
for the Immortal to Lord's Mansion.

00:31:50.510 --> 00:31:52.680
The Lord's Mansion paid the immortal directly.

00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:53.750
You can ask them

00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:56.430
about that, Young Mistress.

00:31:59.790 --> 00:32:02.030
Where is the immortal now?

Is there an old madman here?

00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:13.320
Yes, there is.

00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:15.160
You mean the immortal?

00:32:15.990 --> 00:32:16.710
What immortal?

00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:17.930
Call him out.

00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:18.680
OK.

You don't need to.

00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:23.030
I expected a noble visitor today

00:32:23.270 --> 00:32:24.640
by cauterizing a tortoiseshell

00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:26.920
and observing its patterns on a whim,

00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:29.270
but I did not expect

00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:31.920
Young Mistress Xichuan to come personally.

00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:33.840
This made me feel shameful.

00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:35.690
Do you know

00:32:35.790 --> 00:32:37.170

[Fortune-telling]

What I did in the bell tower was nothing.

00:32:40.270 --> 00:32:42.270
It was a small token of my devotion

00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:44.400
to the people of the city.

00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:47.380
I lost ten years of my life

00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:49.030
to exorcise the evil,

00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:50.990

Why did you do this?

You didn't see this coming,

Tell me.

This bamboo slip

00:33:20.390 --> 00:33:22.520
exactly the same as the one on the bell tower.

understand it?

It's an ancient artifact,

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:34.890
but the wooden document recording the chapter on evil breaking

00:33:34.890 --> 00:33:35.680
has been switched,

00:33:36.280 --> 00:33:38.160

On that day, the Chairman got news

that Che Hujue had gotten a shipment of weapons

So the Chairman decided to make a countermeasure
