=Episode 13=

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.959
Who was it?

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.959
The Princess Royal,

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.319
Xiao Pingning.

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:33.680
Xiao Pingning?

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:36.439
Why would she do that?

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.200
Is this answer

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.280
what you were hoping for in your heart?

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:53.760
It is what I wished for.

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.079
Yet I fear deceiving myself,

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:59.280
only to end up with empty joy.

00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:05.959
Master, please help me invite
the Princess Royal for a meeting.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.280
Has your injury improved, sir?

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:40.770
Thank you for your concern,
Your Highness.

00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:42.280
I am fine.

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.960
It is rare for you to request
a meeting on your own accord.

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.919
May I ask

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:48.840
what this is about?

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:51.400
There is someone very important to me.

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:53.800
She was born with asthma

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.319
and has suffered greatly.

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.080
So I hoped to ask Your Highness

00:02:59.199 --> 00:03:01.400
for a medicinal herb
that could save her life.

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:04.159
What is it?

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:06.680
Windvine.

00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:13.960
And why are you so certain

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.199
that I can help you?

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.680
I searched far and wide

00:03:19.439 --> 00:03:21.400
and finally found Master Jueyuan.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.879
He did indeed have one Windvine plant.

00:03:24.719 --> 00:03:25.719
But unfortunately,

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:28.479
he told me that this Windvine

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:31.680
has already been reserved
by Your Highness.

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:34.120
That is correct.

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:36.120
Your Highness went to great lengths

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.080
and donated a large sum to the temple

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.390
for the sake
of that single Windvine plant.

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:44.400
If I may be so bold to ask,

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.280
why?

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.400
For the same reason as you.

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.599
There is someone I wish to save.

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.919
Who is it?

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:00.120
An old acquaintance.

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:20.079
Would Your Highness be willing

00:04:21.879 --> 00:04:23.279
to part with the Windvine

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:25.720
and let me have it?

00:04:27.279 --> 00:04:28.160
Very well.

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:31.720
Only, if I give it to you,

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.519
my acquaintance

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:34.959
will have to suffer for it.

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:40.360
That little girl

00:04:40.759 --> 00:04:42.839
has had asthma since childhood.

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:44.560
Whenever it flares up,

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:45.879
it is truly life threatening.

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:47.839
I heard that

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:51.600
when her grandfather was alive,
he exhausted every effort

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.100
searching across the land
for medicine for her.

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:56.560
But later on

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:59.040
her grandfather

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.160
passed away.

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:09.279
So then,

00:05:10.439 --> 00:05:11.720
do you still want it?

00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:18.879
Your Highness.

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.620
General Gan has gone
to the Princess Royal's Residence.

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:25.720
He said he will not leave
unless he sees you.

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:33.959
Have you decided?

00:05:34.879 --> 00:05:36.360
Mr. Qingya.

00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:49.550
It seems Your Highness's acquaintance
is more important.

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:51.519
I will find another way.

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:16.780
(Princess Royal Yong'an's Residence)

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:22.399
Your Highness seems rather busy lately.

00:06:22.759 --> 00:06:23.639
Could it be

00:06:24.399 --> 00:06:25.800
you are hiding something from me?

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:28.560
Who allowed you to barge into my room?

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:32.470
I have even barged into the palace.

00:06:32.959 --> 00:06:33.879
Let alone

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:37.920
your little Princess Royal's Residence.

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:40.800
What exactly do you want?

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:43.199
You seem very nervous.

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:47.519
Do not worry.

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:51.120
I simply came across
a rare treasure by chance

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:54.639
and could not wait
to bring it to Your Highness

00:06:54.959 --> 00:06:55.959
for your appreciation.

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:00.000
What is it that makes you so eager?

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:15.319
Open it and see.

00:07:30.319 --> 00:07:31.319
Well?

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:33.160
This gift,

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:35.680
Your Highness recognizes it, do you?

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:37.519
You truly are mad.

00:07:37.839 --> 00:07:39.240
You bring me a corpse as a gift?

00:07:39.879 --> 00:07:40.759
Take a good look.

00:07:41.639 --> 00:07:44.199
This is the spy
you sent into my residence.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.120
What are you talking about?

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:47.160
I...

00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:49.199
I do not understand.

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:54.839
Your Highness is so delicate and frail.

00:07:55.519 --> 00:07:56.319
Perhaps

00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:59.560
I should help
strengthen your body a little.

00:08:12.519 --> 00:08:13.319
Your Highness,

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:15.639
as long as you obey me,

00:08:16.079 --> 00:08:17.639
all these elite soldiers outside

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:19.120
would have been here to protect you.

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:22.160
But you refused.

00:08:24.199 --> 00:08:25.360
Do you know why?

00:08:26.399 --> 00:08:27.800
You have been married before.

00:08:28.279 --> 00:08:29.800
Would I still be willing to marry you?

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:33.639
I heard the Eldest Prince was impotent.

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:37.200
So you remain untouched even now.

00:08:38.039 --> 00:08:38.840
In that case,

00:08:40.039 --> 00:08:41.770
why not consummate
our marriage here today,

00:08:42.039 --> 00:08:43.679
ahead of time?

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:49.240
Are you planning to break our agreement?

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:52.559
How ridiculous.

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:54.759
You bargain with me on one hand

00:08:54.759 --> 00:08:56.600
while sending people
to spy on me on the other.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.639
Do you truly take me for a fool?

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:04.919
Look here.

00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:08.679
Does this not resemble Beijiang?

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:15.240
I heard

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:18.759
that back then,
the Eldest Prince tied you up

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:22.279
right in a place like this.

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:44.279
No.

00:09:46.399 --> 00:09:47.080
No.

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:00.639
No.

00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:11.980
(Lotus Pavilion)

00:10:19.279 --> 00:10:20.080
Sir.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:22.799
How?

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:24.120
What have you found?

00:10:24.279 --> 00:10:26.160
After obtaining the Windvine,
the Princess Royal

00:10:26.170 --> 00:10:28.990
secretly sent someone to deliver it to
a remote secondary residence outside the city.

00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:30.159
The place is heavily guarded.

00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:32.679
My men did not dare get too close
for fear of alerting them.

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:36.240
Therefore we were unable
to see who she was.

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:38.840
Even so, we confirmed

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:42.039
that an old woman
and a young girl live inside.

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:53.519
Mrs. Liu and Zhao.

00:10:55.799 --> 00:10:56.600
Could it be...

00:10:58.639 --> 00:10:59.799
Could she truly...

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:04.500
Senior, you told me to keep an eye

00:11:04.510 --> 00:11:06.600
on Xiao Pingning
after she returned to her residence.

00:11:06.639 --> 00:11:08.480
I saw General Gan take her away.

00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:10.620
The two of them rode toward
the direction of the military camp.

00:11:10.639 --> 00:11:11.440
The military camp?

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:12.200
Yes.

00:11:12.919 --> 00:11:13.720
Could they possibly

00:11:14.450 --> 00:11:15.279
be planning a revolt?

00:11:15.799 --> 00:11:16.240
Impossible.

00:11:17.759 --> 00:11:18.279
True.

00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:20.790
The two of them did not look
as if they were acting together.

00:11:20.919 --> 00:11:22.600
Xiao Pingning seemed reluctant.

00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:24.790
It looked more like
Gan Sheng forced her along.
