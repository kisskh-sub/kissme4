00:00:55.679 --> 00:00:56.960
I made all this salt myself.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:58.520
You made it?

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:01.920
Not bad, kid.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:04.959
It's all the Emperor's fault.

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:06.400
He just had to cut off our supplies.

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.640
Otherwise, you wouldn't need to find a way.

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:09.319
Uncle Zhang,

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:10.959
be careful what you say.

00:01:12.239 --> 00:01:13.280
Loose talk could get us killed.

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:17.040
Who is this?

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:20.040
He's one of us.

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:23.719
Uncle Zhang,

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.480
he's with us. These days,

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:26.640
the soldiers have worked hard.

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.439
Let them relax tonight.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:30.920
Thank you, Young Duke.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:43.000
Let's go.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.760
Brother,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:57.519
you've worked hard.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:58.319
It's nothing, really.

00:01:58.599 --> 00:01:59.359
Need any help?

00:01:59.519 --> 00:02:00.400
No need, no need.

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:01.599
I'll head over first, then.

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:02.599
Go ahead.

00:02:03.519 --> 00:02:04.359
Come for skewers tonight.

00:02:04.519 --> 00:02:05.439
Sure, sure, sure.

00:02:19.719 --> 00:02:21.319
Eight horses, that's lucky!

00:02:21.919 --> 00:02:22.800
Come, drink up!

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:23.639
You're too slow.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.680
Drink faster.

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.800
A bet's a bet.

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.240
Come on, fill it up!

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:34.439
Here, Uncle Zhang.

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:35.479
Here.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:52.439
Have something warm.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.039
Alright.

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.439
For you.

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:55.159
I'll take it.

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:03.479
No going back.

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:05.520
The old days are gone.

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.599
Last time we drank like this was in Shu Zhou.

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:23.000
Now, everything's changed.

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:26.360
Uncle Zhang means Ren Gengyao, the former Shu Zhou magistrate.

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:31.039
That's right.

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:33.879
Old Ren was an honest official.

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:35.560
No idea who set him up.

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.599
The Duke and I arrived too late.

00:03:38.719 --> 00:03:40.680
The whole Ren family was killed.

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.199
Could there be more to it?

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.319
When do we make a move?

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.639
If you're scared, I'll go alone.

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:07.800
Feifan, say a few words.

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:15.319
Soldiers,

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.959
this cup

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:18.920
is for the Shi Family Army.

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:20.399
You've all worked hard.

00:04:21.439 --> 00:04:23.879
Loyal to our country, sworn to serve.

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.639
Loyal to our country, sworn to serve.

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:29.399
Loyal to our country, sworn to serve.

00:04:29.519 --> 00:04:32.199
Loyal to our country, sworn to serve.

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:33.079
Cheers!

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:34.680
Cheers! Cheers!

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:40.160
Come on, everyone, eat and drink well!

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:41.079
Alright.

00:04:46.079 --> 00:04:47.959
Feifan, you're not young anymore.

00:04:48.399 --> 00:04:49.720
They say, settle down first.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.839
Start a family first.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.639
Uncle Zhang, I'm not done having fun.

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:55.680
I can still play for a few years.

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:57.360
I understand.

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:00.439
Ziyan from Cangxiang Pavilion,

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.240
a beauty known across the land.

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:04.639
Come.

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:05.560
Drink, Uncle Zhang, come on.

00:05:14.879 --> 00:05:16.160
Young man, come, drink.

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.600
Uncle Zhang, she can't drink.

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:18.600
I'll drink with you.

00:05:19.959 --> 00:05:21.279
Looks like that's not needed.

00:05:23.519 --> 00:05:24.160
Fill it up.

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:30.759
You've got guts.

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:32.480
Good kid, I like you.

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:33.439
Come, drink.

00:05:33.759 --> 00:05:34.560
Uncle Zhang,

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:36.600
You haven't really drunk with me yet.

00:05:36.879 --> 00:05:38.480
Why do I feel a bit dizzy?

00:06:06.879 --> 00:06:07.399
Drink.

00:06:07.519 --> 00:06:08.079
Alright!

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:15.000
Thank you, everyone.

00:06:15.319 --> 00:06:15.639
Cheers!

00:06:15.759 --> 00:06:16.639
Cheers! Cheers!

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:35.639
Darn it, darn it.

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:48.120
Uncle Zhang,

00:07:48.959 --> 00:07:50.000
I'll leave this person to you.

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:51.199
Don't worry.

00:07:51.959 --> 00:07:53.199
If you hurt my soldiers,

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:54.759
you'll come in standing

00:07:54.839 --> 00:07:55.560
and leave lying down.

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:57.240
Someone, drag him over there.

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:34.840
Young Duke,

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:35.799
Something's wrong.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.840
The Duke went to the palace and hasn't returned.

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:38.799
What?

00:08:39.799 --> 00:08:40.879
Whenever the Emperor summoned him,

00:08:41.039 --> 00:08:41.679
even if it was late,

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:42.879
the Duke would always come back.

00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:44.399
This time, something's happened.

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:46.919
Is there any way I can enter the palace now?

00:08:47.039 --> 00:08:48.120
Unless the Emperor summons you.

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:50.399
Entering without permission means execution.

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:14.360
Your Majesty, it seems I've won again.

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:18.720
Imperial Brother,

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:24.600
Minister Shi, it's been all night.

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:25.600
Go on home.

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:29.879
Your Majesty, I take my leave.

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:46.960
That was close.

00:09:47.799 --> 00:09:50.039
Good thing Feifan was so foresighted.

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:52.159
Take this.

00:09:56.159 --> 00:09:57.080
If there's danger,

00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:58.559
it could save your life.

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:01.840
With a son like this,

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.639
what more could I ask for?

00:10:11.759 --> 00:10:12.679
You, you...

00:10:12.919 --> 00:10:14.000
At least you came back.

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:15.720
Imperial Brother,

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:18.039
Zhi'er went on your mission, didn't he?

00:10:18.799 --> 00:10:19.639
I think you

00:10:19.919 --> 00:10:21.320
just used my name

00:10:21.519 --> 00:10:23.080
to enjoy yourself outside the palace.

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:24.879
Imperial Brother,

00:10:25.519 --> 00:10:27.600
I heard last night

00:10:27.759 --> 00:10:29.120
the Duke of Nan didn't go home.

00:10:29.399 --> 00:10:31.840
So he was here playing chess with you.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.240
So you came for the Duke of Nan.

00:10:38.039 --> 00:10:38.919
Imperial Brother,

00:10:39.799 --> 00:10:40.360
Imperial Brother,

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:41.759
Last night,

00:10:41.919 --> 00:10:44.159
were you really playing chess with the Duke all night?

00:10:47.879 --> 00:10:48.600
Minister Shi,

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:50.960
the Duke's manor made fake private salt.

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:52.200
Do you have anything to say?

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:06.679
Salt-making method

00:11:08.919 --> 00:11:09.600
Imperial Brother

00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:11.480
Salt is just like grain,

00:11:11.679 --> 00:11:13.840
A long shortage will surely cause big trouble.

00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:16.240
That's exactly why

00:11:16.519 --> 00:11:17.679
it gives unscrupulous merchants

00:11:17.919 --> 00:11:19.240
a chance to profit.

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:21.559
That's why illegal salt keeps resurfacing.

00:11:21.879 --> 00:11:24.279
Illegal salt is so expensive

00:11:24.519 --> 00:11:26.240
because official salt costs too much.

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:28.279
So the people can only buy illegal salt.

00:11:29.919 --> 00:11:30.919
But now things are better.

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:33.240
The court now controls this technique.

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:35.440
We can produce fine salt endlessly.

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:39.039
I will no longer be at others' mercy.

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:45.600
Imperial Brother,

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:48.000
you've always cared for the people.

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:50.039
The people will surely praise you.

00:11:50.679 --> 00:11:52.679
You always say what I want to hear.

00:11:55.799 --> 00:11:56.519
Imperial Brother,

00:11:57.039 --> 00:12:00.320
Shi Feifan presented the salt-making method.

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:02.360
Shouldn't he be rewarded?

00:12:05.399 --> 00:12:06.559
Merits and faults offset each other.

00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:10.919
Imperial Brother,

00:12:11.039 --> 00:12:12.320
After days of observation,

00:12:12.639 --> 00:12:14.320
the Duke's residence has no hidden agenda.

00:12:15.919 --> 00:12:17.639
Since the Duke's residence is loyal,

00:12:18.759 --> 00:12:20.080
Zhi'er doesn't need to return.

00:12:20.679 --> 00:12:21.200
I...

00:12:41.159 --> 00:12:42.799
Ping'an, if my father doesn't return,

00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:43.960
I'll take poison into the palace.

00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:44.919
Then you all must run quickly.

00:12:47.639 --> 00:12:48.120
Father!

00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:49.759
Father!

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:51.559
The Emperor didn't trouble you, right?

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:55.480
His Majesty didn't make things difficult.

00:12:55.679 --> 00:12:57.600
He even said Feifan foresaw everything.

00:12:57.840 --> 00:12:59.639
He has a righteous heart.

00:13:00.799 --> 00:13:02.039
I'm glad you're safe.

00:13:02.799 --> 00:13:03.279
Father,

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.279
Now the time is ripe.

00:13:06.519 --> 00:13:08.279
Why not hand over the tiger tally?

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:17.039
Feifan has finally matured.

00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:19.519
But now is not the right time.

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:22.919
Court factions are not yet purged.

00:13:23.279 --> 00:13:25.399
The court seems calm,

00:13:25.399 --> 00:13:27.200
but there are hidden currents.

00:13:27.759 --> 00:13:29.360
His Majesty is the Son of Heaven,

00:13:29.559 --> 00:13:30.799
and has the talent to rule.

00:13:31.519 --> 00:13:34.600
But lacks great deeds to win all hearts.

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:37.360
If we hand over the tally now,

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:39.799
it seems the Emperor regains command,

00:13:40.639 --> 00:13:41.639
but it also puts His Majesty

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:43.759
in an even more dangerous position.

00:13:49.759 --> 00:13:50.720
Put the poison away.

00:13:50.919 --> 00:13:51.480
It's fine.

00:13:51.919 --> 00:13:52.799
It's just for scaring people.

00:13:55.279 --> 00:13:56.000
Young Duke!

00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:57.679
Young Duke! Young Duke!

00:13:58.879 --> 00:13:59.399
Duke!
