(Moon River)

00:00:09.155 --> 00:00:10.485
(All people, incidents, and backgrounds...)

00:00:10.555 --> 00:00:11.785
(in this drama are fictitious and unrelated to reality.)

00:00:11.855 --> 00:00:13.125
(Also, children and animals were filmed under production guidelines.)

00:00:31.375 --> 00:00:32.375
You have done well.

00:00:34.545 --> 00:00:37.385
At dawn, I will interrogate the Left State Councillor myself.

00:00:38.845 --> 00:00:40.145
So you should return to the palace as well.

00:00:40.655 --> 00:00:41.985
As you command, Your Majesty.

00:00:42.455 --> 00:00:44.155
The Royal Concubine must have been very frightened.

00:00:44.825 --> 00:00:46.125
No, I am all right.

00:00:55.235 --> 00:00:58.035
Your Royal Highness, why the long face?

00:00:58.765 --> 00:00:59.905
It is all over now,

00:01:00.165 --> 00:01:03.005
but I am worried that you still seem so upset.

00:01:05.005 --> 00:01:07.205
His Majesty must have mixed feelings as well.

00:01:07.845 --> 00:01:10.685
After all, he lost my mother because of the Left State Councillor.

00:01:13.745 --> 00:01:14.755
Royal Mother

00:01:15.715 --> 00:01:16.715
Royal Mother

00:01:22.695 --> 00:01:23.695
Your Highness.

00:01:24.925 --> 00:01:28.895
- I have been having these dreams. - Your Highness.

00:01:29.665 --> 00:01:30.735
What are your orders regarding this woman?

00:01:37.305 --> 00:01:40.075
You must leave before my father has you killed.

00:01:42.275 --> 00:01:43.745
Do not worry about your mother.

00:01:44.645 --> 00:01:45.645
Just save yourself.

00:01:45.985 --> 00:01:48.815
My mother's life is in the Left State Councillor's hands,

00:01:49.355 --> 00:01:50.485
so I am not going anywhere.

00:01:56.995 --> 00:01:57.995
I am sorry.

00:01:59.465 --> 00:02:01.135
I apologise on my father's behalf.

00:02:01.935 --> 00:02:03.235
There is no need for that.

00:02:11.375 --> 00:02:13.475
- Not that pot. The other one. - Right.

00:02:18.315 --> 00:02:19.485
The Left State Councillor is jailed,

00:02:19.515 --> 00:02:20.915
and the Royal Investigation Office will investigate him.

00:02:23.255 --> 00:02:25.655
What has you so deep in thought?

00:02:26.225 --> 00:02:28.495
I wonder what started this tragedy.

00:02:29.095 --> 00:02:33.195
What drove the Left State Councillor to be so relentlessly evil?

00:02:34.495 --> 00:02:35.495
I am just curious.

00:02:36.265 --> 00:02:37.665
You know the saying.

00:02:38.035 --> 00:02:40.605
Good people cannot fathom true evil,

00:02:40.705 --> 00:02:43.305
and evil people cannot fathom true goodness.

00:02:43.635 --> 00:02:46.575
There is a four-character idiom for it. "Good, evil..."

00:02:47.675 --> 00:02:51.385
My lord, you will never understand a man like him, not ever.

00:02:52.045 --> 00:02:53.515
We should get going. We are running out of time.

00:02:59.025 --> 00:03:00.025
Let us go.

00:03:01.255 --> 00:03:02.255
Get this out of the way.

00:03:28.415 --> 00:03:29.415
The Crown Prince's Concubine.

00:03:31.685 --> 00:03:32.685
No.

00:03:34.425 --> 00:03:35.895
Kill the Crown Princess.

00:03:37.765 --> 00:03:41.565
(Chapter 10: The Calm Before the Storm)

00:04:11.695 --> 00:04:13.495
The Left State Councillor has been arrested.

00:04:13.825 --> 00:04:16.065
I will take our men to the Royal Investigation Office.

00:04:16.465 --> 00:04:18.965
- We have no orders from him. - But...

00:04:21.535 --> 00:04:24.375
We have no orders from him.

00:04:26.045 --> 00:04:28.915
Have you forgotten that we only act on his orders?

00:04:29.615 --> 00:04:30.615
My apologies.

00:04:31.845 --> 00:04:34.255
Leave me. I am busy.

00:04:44.525 --> 00:04:46.425
Do you think you can just borrow money and not pay it back?

00:04:47.225 --> 00:04:50.295
Even Buddha has no mercy for wicked men like you.

00:04:50.535 --> 00:04:53.235
But I already paid back the principal!

00:04:53.705 --> 00:04:55.075
You only paid back the principal.

00:04:55.505 --> 00:04:58.505
- Who is going to pay the interest? - Darn it!

00:04:58.845 --> 00:05:01.645
Just kill me, you thief!

00:05:04.745 --> 00:05:06.345
People have this misconception.

00:05:06.885 --> 00:05:10.455
They think since life is precious, it must be valuable.

00:05:11.185 --> 00:05:14.755
- You lot will never earn a dime. - You...

00:05:15.895 --> 00:05:18.365
Sell the older one as a slave and the younger one as a eunuch.

00:05:18.425 --> 00:05:21.335
No! You cannot, you jerk! No!

00:05:24.535 --> 00:05:27.105
Your Highness, there is terrible news.

00:05:27.305 --> 00:05:28.734
The Left State Councillor...

00:05:28.735 --> 00:05:30.844
has been jailed at the Royal Investigation Office.

00:05:30.845 --> 00:05:31.845
My father?

00:05:32.075 --> 00:05:35.375
Evidence was found at his residence, proving he is the Jimjo's master.

00:05:35.915 --> 00:05:37.885
Since the Jimjo attacked the palace, this is...

00:05:38.485 --> 00:05:39.485
considered an act of treason.

00:05:41.815 --> 00:05:42.815
What should we do, Your Highness?

00:05:43.155 --> 00:05:45.425
- If it is treason... - Then Your Highness could also...

00:05:45.925 --> 00:05:48.855
be placed in confinement or even arrested.

00:05:58.905 --> 00:06:00.265
I have to go to the Royal Investigation Office.

00:06:00.905 --> 00:06:05.445
- I need to see my father in person. - Yes. I will handle it discreetly.

00:06:19.125 --> 00:06:22.055
Your Highness. This is not the way to the Royal Investigation Office.

00:06:24.895 --> 00:06:27.935
I think there is a pebble in my shoe. With my position,

00:06:28.265 --> 00:06:30.565
I cannot very well take it out in the middle of the road.

00:06:31.035 --> 00:06:32.035
Of course, Your Highness.

00:06:49.385 --> 00:06:50.385
Yeo Ri.

00:06:50.955 --> 00:06:51.955
Yes, Your Highness?

00:06:52.855 --> 00:06:53.855
What are you doing?

00:06:54.125 --> 00:06:57.225
- Let go of me! Goodness. - Please hold still.

00:06:57.295 --> 00:06:58.295
Your Highness!

00:07:11.275 --> 00:07:13.505
The patrol will be here soon, so just stay put for a moment.

00:07:14.645 --> 00:07:15.975
I am so sorry, my lady.

00:07:17.645 --> 00:07:18.645
I am sorry as well.

00:07:28.125 --> 00:07:29.655
The day your father is arrested,

00:07:29.995 --> 00:07:32.295
pack light and meet me at the greenhouse.

00:07:32.795 --> 00:07:35.635
That day, we are going to run away together.

00:08:13.305 --> 00:08:14.305
U Hui.

00:08:17.175 --> 00:08:18.175
You have been through so much.

00:08:22.745 --> 00:08:24.215
- Here... - Go ahead.

00:08:24.845 --> 00:08:25.845
Hurry.

00:08:26.415 --> 00:08:29.015
You two can catch up later,

00:08:29.385 --> 00:08:30.385
but change into your disguises first.

00:08:30.785 --> 00:08:31.785
Right.

00:08:43.135 --> 00:08:44.135
Well...

00:08:44.565 --> 00:08:46.465
Yeo Ri, are you finished changing yet?

00:08:46.805 --> 00:08:49.205
We are. He is certainly in a hurry.

00:09:51.135 --> 00:09:54.475
You seem upset you will not be able to visit the greenhouse anymore.

00:09:55.235 --> 00:09:59.545
After all, you always did love this greenhouse.

00:10:00.375 --> 00:10:01.715
It was you I loved.

00:10:13.455 --> 00:10:14.455
Gosh.

00:10:14.825 --> 00:10:18.265
You can do that later. Let us go. We have a long journey ahead.

00:10:19.595 --> 00:10:20.595
Let us go.

00:10:30.375 --> 00:10:32.205
Who forced you to a false confession?

00:10:32.575 --> 00:10:34.745
Grant my request, and I will tell you.

00:10:35.475 --> 00:10:36.845
I will even testify.

00:10:37.885 --> 00:10:40.144
Your lie almost killed the Royal Concubine,

00:10:40.145 --> 00:10:41.155
and you dare to make demands?

00:10:41.385 --> 00:10:42.415
How dare you?

00:10:47.425 --> 00:10:49.425
First off, what is your request?

00:10:49.795 --> 00:10:52.595
If you promise to spare the life of the former Chief Royal Secretary,

00:10:53.025 --> 00:10:56.435
I will tell you everything. Please save the Chief Royal Secretary.

00:10:56.635 --> 00:10:57.835
The former Chief Royal Secretary?

00:10:58.135 --> 00:11:00.065
You mean Han Seok Won, who was sent into exile?

00:11:01.275 --> 00:11:02.275
Do not tell me...

00:11:02.775 --> 00:11:03.875
You and that official...

00:11:05.675 --> 00:11:06.905
are lovers?

00:11:10.775 --> 00:11:12.245
If that is your concern, do not worry.

00:11:12.615 --> 00:11:14.615
The Left State Councillor is arrested at the Royal Investigation Office.

00:11:14.685 --> 00:11:16.115
You think the Left State Councillor would do it himself?

00:11:16.715 --> 00:11:18.084
His underlings have their orders.

00:11:18.085 --> 00:11:19.455
They will be the ones to kill the Chief Royal Secretary.

00:11:32.565 --> 00:11:33.605
What are you going to do?

00:11:34.105 --> 00:11:35.575
She is a criminal who endangered you.

00:11:36.035 --> 00:11:37.505
Why should I grant her wish?

00:11:38.705 --> 00:11:40.645
But she only did it to save her lover.

00:11:40.745 --> 00:11:43.715
If her own lover is so precious, she should know others' are too.

00:11:46.415 --> 00:11:48.715
I am so furious at the Left State Councillor's actions.

00:11:49.555 --> 00:11:52.225
The Left State Councillor acts as if he is the Almighty...

00:11:52.585 --> 00:11:53.825
or the Buddha,

00:11:54.455 --> 00:11:56.455
preying on people's weaknesses and toying with their feelings this way.

00:11:57.455 --> 00:11:59.725
How can anyone think straight when they are in his palm?

00:12:08.775 --> 00:12:11.245
Are you really just going to let this happen?

00:12:17.415 --> 00:12:19.485
You always find a way to make me feel ashamed of myself.

00:12:23.455 --> 00:12:26.085
Send former Secretary Han Seok Won to the Royal Investigation Office...

00:12:26.125 --> 00:12:27.325
and guard him closely.

00:12:27.685 --> 00:12:30.424
Announce the reopening of the Sinjusa case as well.

00:12:30.425 --> 00:12:31.525
Yes, Your Highness.

00:12:36.335 --> 00:12:37.335
Oh, my.

00:12:37.865 --> 00:12:38.865
Right now?

00:12:44.235 --> 00:12:45.405
I guess I am just hungry.

00:12:46.675 --> 00:12:48.315
You are hungry?

00:12:49.175 --> 00:12:50.545
You should go get something to eat...

00:12:51.615 --> 00:12:52.615
Wait a minute.

00:12:53.585 --> 00:12:54.885
They have not fed you yet?

00:12:55.855 --> 00:12:58.455
- Why those jerks... - I did eat, but...

00:12:58.525 --> 00:13:00.225
Your Highness, you did not feed us either.

00:13:00.785 --> 00:13:02.855
We were in no condition to eat, were we?

00:13:03.155 --> 00:13:05.095
The situation was extremely unusual and urgent.

00:13:05.525 --> 00:13:07.594
- Is that not right? - I am fine, Your Highness.

00:13:07.595 --> 00:13:10.095
I am used to such harsh treatment.

00:13:12.205 --> 00:13:14.975
Honestly. Why would you do that?

00:13:15.705 --> 00:13:19.845
Generosity comes from great wealth, loyalty from a full stomach. Right?

00:13:20.545 --> 00:13:24.375
This will not do. I will treat you to great rice soup,

00:13:24.685 --> 00:13:26.245
so my two loyal subjects, follow me.

00:13:28.585 --> 00:13:30.085
Rice soup sounds delicious.

00:13:35.555 --> 00:13:37.195
Hey, buy me some too!

00:13:39.195 --> 00:13:40.195
I am hungry too.

00:13:41.735 --> 00:13:42.735
What?

00:13:44.735 --> 00:13:46.834
Grand Prince Je Un and the Crown Princess Consort left?

00:13:46.835 --> 00:13:47.905
All of a sudden?

00:13:49.175 --> 00:13:51.035
It all happened so suddenly.

00:13:51.605 --> 00:13:53.475
They did not even get to say goodbye to me.

00:13:54.245 --> 00:13:55.245
Gang.

00:13:57.545 --> 00:14:00.245
I will leave right after the Left State Councillor's arrest.

00:14:00.445 --> 00:14:02.185
What? Why so suddenly?

00:14:02.515 --> 00:14:03.815
Surely, you understand.

00:14:04.185 --> 00:14:05.785
If the Left State Councillor is arrested for treason,

00:14:06.185 --> 00:14:09.025
U Hui will be arrested as well. There is no time.

00:14:12.095 --> 00:14:15.535
Where will you go? Do you even have a plan?

00:14:16.265 --> 00:14:18.405
Yes, I plan to go to Qing.

00:14:18.965 --> 00:14:22.035
I heard a merchant ship is leaving for Qing from Jemulpo tomorrow.

00:14:23.405 --> 00:14:26.745
But still, how could he leave without a word?

00:14:27.875 --> 00:14:28.875
Gosh.

00:14:29.775 --> 00:14:30.775
What is this?

00:14:31.645 --> 00:14:32.685
Are you seriously putting down your spoon...

00:14:33.045 --> 00:14:35.185
in front of me because another man left?

00:14:35.555 --> 00:14:37.485
After all the time we spent together,

00:14:37.785 --> 00:14:39.385
he left without a word.

00:14:40.125 --> 00:14:42.795
I just feel so empty inside. I have lost my appetite.

00:14:42.895 --> 00:14:46.225
Please. Just how close did you two get?

00:14:47.065 --> 00:14:48.895
Hey, pick up your spoon now.

00:14:50.465 --> 00:14:51.535
She finished the whole bowl.

00:14:51.835 --> 00:14:53.265
Yes, she scraped the bowl clean.

00:14:56.735 --> 00:14:57.735
I thought you lost your appetite.

00:14:59.245 --> 00:15:00.245
Oh, gosh.

00:15:42.315 --> 00:15:46.285
(Royal Investigation Office)

00:15:58.635 --> 00:15:59.705
Left State Councillor!

00:16:02.435 --> 00:16:05.605
What brings you here at this hour?

00:16:05.945 --> 00:16:08.545
I deserve to die. The Crown Princess Consort...

00:16:10.145 --> 00:16:11.615
has fled.

00:16:15.955 --> 00:16:17.915
Send out my men and find U Hui.

00:16:18.525 --> 00:16:20.985
Distribute her sketch to all the taverns and inns.

00:16:21.725 --> 00:16:24.865
Block all roads leading to the ports and the border.

00:16:26.025 --> 00:16:27.025
Under no circumstances...

00:16:27.565 --> 00:16:29.395
is anyone else to find out.

00:16:29.835 --> 00:16:30.835
Yes, my lord.

00:16:57.425 --> 00:16:58.425
Gosh!

00:16:59.795 --> 00:17:01.225
I am so exhausted. I cannot go on.

00:17:01.325 --> 00:17:03.495
Yeo Ri, one might think you are the young lady.

00:17:03.865 --> 00:17:06.535
How are you more exhausted than the Left State Councillor's daughter?

00:17:06.605 --> 00:17:08.875
What, were you raised like a princess?

00:17:09.375 --> 00:17:10.575
Actually,

00:17:10.935 --> 00:17:15.175
it is better to serve a rich family. I have never really had it rough.

00:17:15.615 --> 00:17:18.385
I served the Left State Councillor, and then I became a court lady.

00:17:18.415 --> 00:17:20.015
So what kind of hardship could I have possibly known?

00:17:20.085 --> 00:17:22.785
For crying out loud. You would think my lord was...

00:17:23.055 --> 00:17:26.755
just some low-ranking official. My lord is royalty!

00:17:26.825 --> 00:17:28.185
He is a Grand Prince!

00:17:28.455 --> 00:17:29.495
Exactly.

00:17:29.895 --> 00:17:31.255
Grand Prince Je Un and his precious lady...

00:17:31.665 --> 00:17:34.995
hit it off, and now we are the ones suffering for it, are we not?

00:17:35.265 --> 00:17:38.505
For someone so tired, you sure have a loud mouth, Yeo Ri.

00:17:38.605 --> 00:17:39.605
Am I wrong?

00:17:40.235 --> 00:17:43.235
Well, it is getting too late,

00:17:44.135 --> 00:17:46.675
so let us stay at that inn.

00:17:46.745 --> 00:17:47.904
- Yes, my lord. - Yes.

00:17:47.905 --> 00:17:49.245
Please be careful.

00:17:49.775 --> 00:17:50.915
Watch your step.

00:17:51.685 --> 00:17:53.245
- Let me carry your... - No!

00:17:53.815 --> 00:17:55.755
Just come on! Darn it.

00:17:55.815 --> 00:17:58.755
Unbelievable. Such a young thing, talking back so defiantly.

00:18:31.655 --> 00:18:32.655
U Hui.

00:18:37.295 --> 00:18:38.965
U Hui, are you asleep?

00:18:41.595 --> 00:18:42.635
U Hui.

00:18:47.965 --> 00:18:49.035
Are you all right?

00:18:51.475 --> 00:18:52.505
Wait a minute.

00:18:53.545 --> 00:18:54.875
Are you laughing right now?

00:18:56.815 --> 00:18:57.815
What a relief.

00:18:58.275 --> 00:19:00.785
The pain tells me this is not a dream.

00:19:05.655 --> 00:19:08.425
- What is this? - What?

00:19:09.825 --> 00:19:10.955
There is nothing there.

00:19:23.705 --> 00:19:25.945
Why do you have soot all over your face?

00:19:26.745 --> 00:19:27.745
Oh, right.

00:19:28.145 --> 00:19:30.875
I must have gotten it on my face while boiling water earlier.

00:19:33.615 --> 00:19:37.314
You boiled the water yourself?

00:19:37.315 --> 00:19:38.315
Yes.

00:19:39.055 --> 00:19:40.355
The innkeeper seemed to be asleep.

00:19:40.655 --> 00:19:42.755
Please. I will do that.

00:19:43.955 --> 00:19:44.955
I do not want you to.

00:19:51.735 --> 00:19:55.435
But why the sudden hot compress?

00:20:03.015 --> 00:20:04.175
Because you were limping.

00:20:07.745 --> 00:20:08.815
You noticed?

00:20:10.285 --> 00:20:11.985
I tried so hard to hide it.

00:20:12.925 --> 00:20:14.125
Do not hide things from me.

00:20:14.985 --> 00:20:16.525
When you suffer in silence,

00:20:18.225 --> 00:20:19.225
that is what hurts me the most.

00:20:20.325 --> 00:20:23.765
I told you, did I not? I would be your brother, your friend,

00:20:24.295 --> 00:20:26.905
your father, and your man.

00:20:29.335 --> 00:20:30.705
That is why I am here.

00:20:32.375 --> 00:20:33.705
So with me,

00:20:34.845 --> 00:20:36.815
if you are angry, you can show it.

00:20:37.345 --> 00:20:38.485
If you feel like crying,

00:20:40.415 --> 00:20:41.585
you can cry in my arms.

00:20:43.815 --> 00:20:44.815
So please,

00:20:47.125 --> 00:20:49.255
do not ever hold back again.

00:20:55.735 --> 00:20:58.965
I will even heat up the cauldron water for you tomorrow morning.

00:21:04.305 --> 00:21:05.305
But...

00:21:06.445 --> 00:21:09.475
- you lit a fire in the furnace? - I did.

00:21:09.515 --> 00:21:11.715
- In the middle of summer? - Yes.

00:21:12.645 --> 00:21:13.645
Why?

00:21:16.815 --> 00:21:20.885
King Yeomra, it is so hot!

00:21:21.755 --> 00:21:23.295
It is so hot.

00:21:23.325 --> 00:21:24.455
Goodness.

00:21:28.025 --> 00:21:31.535
Gosh! It is way too hot.

00:21:32.565 --> 00:21:35.235
I cannot stand the fires of the fiery pit.

00:21:41.145 --> 00:21:42.145
Sleep warm.

00:21:57.495 --> 00:21:59.165
Please take me to the palace.

00:22:00.095 --> 00:22:01.095
Please save me.

00:22:23.655 --> 00:22:25.525
Why do I keep having such dreams?

00:22:29.495 --> 00:22:31.424
Five years ago in winter,

00:22:31.425 --> 00:22:34.495
a family from Hanyang arrived suddenly.

00:22:34.795 --> 00:22:36.065
Who are you?

00:22:36.695 --> 00:22:37.695
You fell into the water,

00:22:38.535 --> 00:22:40.405
and it seems you have lost your memory.

00:22:41.435 --> 00:22:43.935
The moment I woke up after losing my memory...

00:22:45.005 --> 00:22:46.475
was five winters ago.

00:22:52.285 --> 00:22:53.285
Then...

00:22:54.015 --> 00:22:55.285
what is this memory?

00:23:20.105 --> 00:23:21.105
Well done.

00:23:24.245 --> 00:23:26.185
Did you sleep well, my lady?

00:23:26.945 --> 00:23:29.215
I dreamed I was a pig sizzling on a cauldron lid.

00:23:29.285 --> 00:23:32.185
I am telling you, I thought my back was completely cooked.

00:23:32.725 --> 00:23:35.425
I met King Yeomra in the fires of the fiery pit.

00:23:35.855 --> 00:23:37.625
My back was killing me, I am serious.

00:23:38.355 --> 00:23:40.465
Where is the innkeeper? Innkeeper!

00:23:40.795 --> 00:23:44.195
Why are the floors burning hot in the middle of summer?

00:23:46.105 --> 00:23:50.335
You will miss Joseon's heated floors once we leave,

00:23:50.635 --> 00:23:52.975
so think of this as one last fond memory.

00:23:56.715 --> 00:23:57.975
Come on, U Hui. Let us go.

00:23:59.715 --> 00:24:01.955
- We should get going. - But my back is killing me.

00:24:02.015 --> 00:24:03.115
Just come on, hurry up.

00:24:04.485 --> 00:24:06.254
Now that it has been revealed...

00:24:06.255 --> 00:24:07.585
that the Left State Councillor is the master of the Jimjo,

00:24:07.825 --> 00:24:09.554
soon he will be exposed as the culprit...

00:24:09.555 --> 00:24:10.725
of the Gyesa Year Incident, right?

00:24:12.265 --> 00:24:14.225
The bodies of those killed with Jimjo poison...

00:24:14.595 --> 00:24:16.895
show the same symptoms as those who died in the Gyesa Year.

00:24:17.535 --> 00:24:19.705
It will be easier to get to the bottom of the incident now.

00:24:21.235 --> 00:24:22.235
You did well.

00:24:22.875 --> 00:24:24.475
You have really been through so much.

00:24:25.075 --> 00:24:26.245
This is just the beginning.

00:24:27.105 --> 00:24:28.275
Now, I have to expose...

00:24:28.975 --> 00:24:31.015
every single evil thing the Left State Councillor has done.

00:24:35.385 --> 00:24:36.385
Lift your arms for me.

00:24:39.255 --> 00:24:41.325
On a day as important as this,

00:24:42.155 --> 00:24:45.125
you must look dignified, Your Royal Highness. All right?

00:24:45.525 --> 00:24:48.125
Your attire must be impeccable.

00:24:53.365 --> 00:24:54.365
Goodness.

00:24:56.375 --> 00:24:59.175
I need strength more than I need dignity.

00:24:59.445 --> 00:25:02.475
What is the matter? It is not even time for the Morning Assembly yet.

00:25:02.945 --> 00:25:04.445
Let us just stay like this for a moment.

00:25:04.715 --> 00:25:05.715
Let me draw some strength from you.

00:25:06.115 --> 00:25:07.585
Gosh.

00:25:09.255 --> 00:25:11.415
That is nice.

00:25:15.425 --> 00:25:18.395
Your Royal Highness, may I enter for a moment?

00:25:18.655 --> 00:25:20.465
No, you cannot. Do not come in.

00:25:20.725 --> 00:25:23.395
- His Majesty is looking for you. - What?

00:25:24.665 --> 00:25:26.165
What do you mean? It is time for the Morning Assembly.

00:25:26.605 --> 00:25:27.605
Right now?

00:25:45.055 --> 00:25:46.055
Your Royal Highness.

00:25:47.725 --> 00:25:49.795
I trust you had a peaceful night.

00:25:52.225 --> 00:25:53.225
No.

00:25:55.635 --> 00:25:56.965
Left State Councillor. What are you doing here?

00:25:57.535 --> 00:25:58.765
After a misunderstanding was cleared,

00:25:59.365 --> 00:26:02.535
His Majesty the King personally granted my release.

00:26:02.875 --> 00:26:03.875
That is impossible.

00:26:04.905 --> 00:26:06.945
Why would he do such a thing?

00:26:07.345 --> 00:26:10.645
You should hear it from His Majesty yourself.

00:26:23.555 --> 00:26:25.095
What is the meaning of this?

00:26:25.625 --> 00:26:28.325
We have proof that the Left State Councillor is the Jimjo's master.

00:26:28.595 --> 00:26:30.695
So how could you possibly set him free?

00:26:31.295 --> 00:26:32.365
The Left State Councillor...

00:26:34.235 --> 00:26:36.705
possesses a secret pact that I wrote with my own hand.

00:26:37.075 --> 00:26:40.105
A secret pact? What kind of pact is it?

00:26:41.005 --> 00:26:42.075
In the Gyesa Year,

00:26:43.175 --> 00:26:45.145
the Left State Councillor came to see me.

00:26:46.445 --> 00:26:48.315
(Gyesa Year)

00:26:48.385 --> 00:26:51.315
(After the former king's death)

00:26:54.555 --> 00:26:58.695
This poison is colourless, odourless, and tasteless.

00:26:59.365 --> 00:27:01.325
It also does not react to silver.

00:27:01.825 --> 00:27:02.835
What is more,

00:27:03.665 --> 00:27:07.565
the bodies of those killed by it do not decay or turn black,

00:27:07.735 --> 00:27:09.235
nor do they bloat.

00:27:12.675 --> 00:27:13.775
At most,

00:27:15.745 --> 00:27:17.315
they might vomit a little blood.

00:27:31.525 --> 00:27:32.525
Then...

00:27:33.525 --> 00:27:35.965
is that the poison that assassinated the King and the Firstborn Prince?

00:27:37.135 --> 00:27:38.135
Yes.

00:27:38.565 --> 00:27:39.665
Have you found the killer?

00:27:40.835 --> 00:27:41.835
Who is it?

00:27:42.235 --> 00:27:44.875
Who would dare commit such a monstrous crime?

00:27:46.105 --> 00:27:47.105
It was me.

00:27:49.745 --> 00:27:51.945
What are you saying?

00:27:53.685 --> 00:27:55.485
Not just the Late King and the Firstborn Prince,

00:27:56.485 --> 00:27:59.955
but the Queen Dowager's two brothers who recently died as well.

00:28:01.685 --> 00:28:03.095
I killed them all.

00:28:04.355 --> 00:28:06.295
I have already done the dirty work.

00:28:06.865 --> 00:28:08.095
So you, Prince Geumseong,

00:28:08.825 --> 00:28:11.195
all you have to do is prepare to take the throne.

00:28:12.865 --> 00:28:13.865
Are you telling me...

00:28:15.165 --> 00:28:17.135
you poisoned my own brother?

00:28:21.605 --> 00:28:23.215
I will go to the Royal Investigation Office right now,

00:28:23.475 --> 00:28:25.585
and I will expose every one of your wicked crimes.

00:28:25.945 --> 00:28:27.485
There is no need for that.

00:28:29.215 --> 00:28:32.225
The Royal Investigation Office is already on their way here.

00:28:33.655 --> 00:28:35.995
I hid this very poison...

00:28:36.795 --> 00:28:38.855
right here in your home.

00:28:39.325 --> 00:28:40.395
That pathetic poison...

00:28:41.065 --> 00:28:44.295
All I have to do is find it first and tell the Office the truth!

00:28:44.495 --> 00:28:46.465
How will you find a poison...

00:28:47.305 --> 00:28:48.665
when you do not even know...

00:28:49.705 --> 00:28:51.835
what you are looking for?

00:29:01.645 --> 00:29:02.885
The choice is yours.

00:29:03.585 --> 00:29:06.525
Be escorted by the Royal Investigation Office's men...

00:29:07.125 --> 00:29:08.825
to the throne,

00:29:09.695 --> 00:29:12.525
or be surrounded by them...

00:29:13.025 --> 00:29:14.495
and be branded a traitor.

00:29:15.065 --> 00:29:16.065
How dare you!

00:29:16.665 --> 00:29:19.705
- Have you no fear of the skies? - I have no fear of the skies!

00:29:20.265 --> 00:29:23.305
I have already resigned myself to the fiery pit anyway.

00:29:47.595 --> 00:29:49.165
You must protect what is yours.

00:30:09.685 --> 00:30:11.315
I, Lee Hui, Prince Geumseong,

00:30:12.855 --> 00:30:14.685
shall appoint Kim Han Chul, the Minister of War,

00:30:15.795 --> 00:30:17.495
as the Left State Councillor...

00:30:19.425 --> 00:30:21.365
and a meritorious subject of the Gyesa Year coup.

00:30:24.095 --> 00:30:25.765
This I do solemnly promise.

00:31:16.985 --> 00:31:18.455
To protect my family,

00:31:19.355 --> 00:31:23.395
I became a monstrous king who killed his brother and nephew.

00:31:24.095 --> 00:31:28.165
He said one pact would solve it all, making him a coup contributor.

00:31:29.295 --> 00:31:30.795
Since I was going to take the throne anyway,

00:31:31.665 --> 00:31:34.035
I thought it would all end with just one signature.

00:31:36.035 --> 00:31:37.305
But that was just the beginning.

00:31:38.075 --> 00:31:40.105
I must become the King's in-law.

00:31:40.705 --> 00:31:42.475
Give me the Crown Prince.

00:31:43.675 --> 00:31:45.245
You want me to depose the Crown Princess?

00:31:46.585 --> 00:31:48.615
- How could you... - Your Majesty has already...

00:31:50.215 --> 00:31:52.155
acknowledged the Gyesa Year incident...

00:31:53.085 --> 00:31:54.985
as a coup, have you not?

00:31:56.325 --> 00:31:57.725
Your Majesty and I...

00:31:58.595 --> 00:32:00.795
are already in the same boat.

00:32:06.905 --> 00:32:08.835
One by one, I gave things away.

00:32:11.135 --> 00:32:13.575
- Royal Father! - Your Majesty.

00:32:16.215 --> 00:32:17.745
Your Majesty.

00:32:20.215 --> 00:32:22.415
Your Majesty.

00:32:24.485 --> 00:32:26.485
Your Majesty.

00:32:27.555 --> 00:32:28.855
Until I lost everything.

00:32:42.535 --> 00:32:45.435
You said I just had to make your daughter the Crown Princess.

00:32:45.845 --> 00:32:48.305
So why? Why?

00:32:48.705 --> 00:32:49.715
Why...

00:32:50.075 --> 00:32:51.915
did you have to kill the Queen as well?

00:32:52.545 --> 00:32:54.215
I could not come up with a proper way...

00:32:55.285 --> 00:32:58.555
to depose the Crown Princess.

00:33:00.655 --> 00:33:02.325
This was your plan all along, was it not?

00:33:02.995 --> 00:33:05.695
To kill everyone who could help me and the Crown Prince,

00:33:06.225 --> 00:33:09.235
and turn us into puppets that you alone could control.

00:33:12.395 --> 00:33:13.405
Power...

00:33:14.965 --> 00:33:16.805
is not something one shares.

00:33:19.075 --> 00:33:20.775
So, what are you going to do about it?

00:33:22.045 --> 00:33:23.775
With those feeble fists of yours,

00:33:24.375 --> 00:33:27.085
are you going to behead me?

00:33:28.015 --> 00:33:29.015
Or...

00:33:30.855 --> 00:33:32.555
will you reveal the secret pact...

00:33:33.125 --> 00:33:35.025
and prove that the coup was illegitimate...

00:33:35.895 --> 00:33:37.855
all by yourself?

00:33:49.335 --> 00:33:50.975
That is right, Your Majesty.

00:33:51.475 --> 00:33:53.675
There is nothing...

00:33:54.605 --> 00:33:56.375
you can do.

00:33:57.445 --> 00:33:59.515
So just stay right where you are.

00:34:00.385 --> 00:34:04.815
Do that, and you might just keep your life.

00:34:21.965 --> 00:34:23.735
I was a prisoner of that secret pact.

00:34:24.975 --> 00:34:27.005
For years, my life was a living nightmare.

00:34:28.545 --> 00:34:29.715
They took everything from me.

00:34:30.475 --> 00:34:31.775
But you are the one thing I managed to protect.

00:34:32.885 --> 00:34:33.885
So, Gang...

00:34:35.345 --> 00:34:36.355
You must survive.

00:34:37.455 --> 00:34:39.015
Live, even if you have to be disgraced and cowardly.

00:34:44.825 --> 00:34:46.325
It was not enough that Mother and the Crown Princess...

00:34:48.065 --> 00:34:49.935
were driven to their deaths.

00:34:51.465 --> 00:34:54.165
Now, I will never be able to clear their names.

00:34:56.205 --> 00:34:59.105
I have to let them remain unjustly accused forever.

00:35:00.345 --> 00:35:01.775
And you are telling me to live?

00:35:04.345 --> 00:35:05.775
Can you even call that living?

00:35:07.545 --> 00:35:09.185
I wanted to take down the Left State Councillor...

00:35:10.615 --> 00:35:12.185
and go back to the way things were...

00:35:14.325 --> 00:35:16.355
with you, Father.

00:35:19.565 --> 00:35:20.765
But now,

00:35:25.165 --> 00:35:28.335
I do not think we can ever go back to how things were.

00:37:29.085 --> 00:37:30.755
The Crown Princess Consort fled?

00:37:31.055 --> 00:37:33.365
Yes. I heard the court maids gossiping...

00:37:33.425 --> 00:37:35.825
with my own two ears.

00:37:38.595 --> 00:37:40.765
- Let us go to the Detached Palace. - Yes, Your Majesty.

00:37:41.405 --> 00:37:44.675
Your Majesty, what brings you here?

00:37:44.775 --> 00:37:46.345
Am I not allowed here?

00:37:47.345 --> 00:37:48.405
Open the door.

00:37:49.345 --> 00:37:51.874
It is just that the Crown Princess Consort...

00:37:51.875 --> 00:37:54.245
is in no condition to receive Your Grace.

00:37:54.345 --> 00:37:55.345
Why not?

00:37:56.285 --> 00:37:58.355
Did she escape in the night?

00:37:58.815 --> 00:38:02.895
Your Majesty, how can you even suggest such a thing?

00:38:03.125 --> 00:38:04.155
Open this door!

00:38:04.795 --> 00:38:05.855
Your Majesty.

00:38:07.795 --> 00:38:09.765
- Get out of my way! - Your Majesty!

00:38:22.845 --> 00:38:24.445
Despite his power, the Left State Councillor...

00:38:24.645 --> 00:38:27.215
failed when it came to his own daughter.

00:38:29.415 --> 00:38:31.415
Call off the Royal Wedding at once,

00:38:31.915 --> 00:38:33.425
and punish the Left State Councillor.

00:38:35.925 --> 00:38:37.755
Why do you hesitate?

00:38:37.995 --> 00:38:39.594
The Crown Princess Consort...

00:38:39.595 --> 00:38:41.025
was not to go outside the Detached Palace,

00:38:41.865 --> 00:38:43.195
and yet, she has escaped.

00:38:43.595 --> 00:38:47.365
Rumours are spreading among the staff that she eloped in the night.

00:38:47.705 --> 00:38:50.475
Are you really just going to let this slide?

00:38:52.335 --> 00:38:54.105
Nothing is certain yet.

00:38:54.545 --> 00:38:56.575
I will act after we investigate further...

00:38:56.645 --> 00:38:58.375
I will not beat around the bush.

00:38:59.315 --> 00:39:03.185
The Late King, the Firstborn Prince, and all who died in the Gyesa Year.

00:39:05.285 --> 00:39:07.325
Did you kill them all, Your Majesty?

00:39:07.485 --> 00:39:10.524
Your Majesty! How can you say such a treasonous thing?

00:39:10.525 --> 00:39:14.095
The Late King was in perfect health, and he had the Firstborn Prince.

00:39:14.425 --> 00:39:18.765
There was no way you could have taken the throne.

00:39:19.195 --> 00:39:20.205
And yet,

00:39:20.605 --> 00:39:22.805
how is it that an opportunity that should never have arisen...

00:39:23.875 --> 00:39:25.735
went to you?

00:39:26.745 --> 00:39:31.745
And why is the Left State Councillor now holding all the power?

00:39:34.515 --> 00:39:35.845
How come the Left State Councillor...

00:39:36.685 --> 00:39:38.785
is already a free man...

00:39:39.655 --> 00:39:40.925
when he was arrested only a few hours ago?

00:39:50.665 --> 00:39:52.065
If that secret pact is revealed,

00:39:52.765 --> 00:39:54.865
His Majesty will be killed.

00:39:56.935 --> 00:39:58.075
And it is all my fault.

00:39:59.505 --> 00:40:03.245
My father signed that pact to protect me.

00:40:04.945 --> 00:40:08.415
The Crown Princess and Royal Mother died because of me.

00:40:19.295 --> 00:40:20.525
But you did not know.

00:40:21.125 --> 00:40:23.035
You did not know a single thing.

00:40:23.995 --> 00:40:25.535
So why are you blaming yourself?

00:40:27.365 --> 00:40:29.135
How can I ever atone for this?

00:40:33.305 --> 00:40:35.145
How can I possibly repay this crime?

00:40:36.175 --> 00:40:37.175
You are right.

00:40:38.015 --> 00:40:39.075
You have to repay them.

00:40:40.245 --> 00:40:41.385
Not with penance,

00:40:42.315 --> 00:40:44.115
but with revenge.

00:40:44.555 --> 00:40:45.555
Revenge?

00:40:47.525 --> 00:40:49.155
Because the coup was a success,

00:40:49.895 --> 00:40:51.955
the Gyesa Year incident is no longer a treason,

00:40:52.695 --> 00:40:54.295
nor is it the Left State Councillor's weakness.

00:40:54.625 --> 00:40:56.835
Unless my Royal Father abdicates in favour of Grand Prince Je Un...

00:40:57.435 --> 00:40:59.765
and reveals the pact himself.

00:41:00.765 --> 00:41:03.805
There is no other way to bring down the Left State Councillor.

00:41:05.935 --> 00:41:08.005
Besides, Grand Prince Je Un has already left.

00:41:09.045 --> 00:41:10.975
We cannot just drag him back and force him onto the throne.

00:41:11.145 --> 00:41:14.585
Even if we could, Je Un is the type to just walk away.

00:41:21.285 --> 00:41:22.285
But...

00:41:23.125 --> 00:41:24.624
the Crown Princess Consort ran away,

00:41:24.625 --> 00:41:26.095
so is that not a crime in its own right?

00:41:27.925 --> 00:41:29.595
Normally, that would be considered treason.

00:41:32.765 --> 00:41:33.805
Wait a minute.

00:41:36.375 --> 00:41:37.805
Why is the Left State Councillor so calm?

00:41:38.005 --> 00:41:39.075
Exactly.

00:41:39.905 --> 00:41:43.175
He was released last night. He must know she has fled by now.

00:41:43.675 --> 00:41:44.675
The Left State Councillor will never give up...

00:41:44.676 --> 00:41:46.045
being the King's in-law.

00:41:46.715 --> 00:41:48.515
He will bring her back no matter what,

00:41:48.985 --> 00:41:50.515
and there is no way he will leave Grand Prince Je Un alone.

00:41:52.215 --> 00:41:53.455
If the Left State Councillor catches him...

00:41:53.785 --> 00:41:55.255
or if the Queen Dowager finds out,

00:41:56.425 --> 00:41:58.595
Grand Prince Je Un will be in deep trouble when he is caught.

00:42:01.525 --> 00:42:05.134
- Come take a look over here. - Hello, there.

00:42:05.135 --> 00:42:06.535
Do you have any fish?

00:42:08.765 --> 00:42:11.305
- We have fresh ones in the back. - Are you okay?

00:42:11.375 --> 00:42:12.375
I am fine.

00:42:15.145 --> 00:42:17.115
This one is really nice and plump.

00:42:17.175 --> 00:42:18.975
They are delicious! Come and take a look.

00:42:48.575 --> 00:42:49.575
Your Highness!

00:42:52.675 --> 00:42:53.845
We are here to escort you.

00:42:54.985 --> 00:42:56.085
What are you doing here?

00:42:56.755 --> 00:42:59.055
You never move without an order from my father.

00:43:00.385 --> 00:43:01.555
I gave the order.

00:43:09.565 --> 00:43:11.265
I have come to retrieve what is mine.

00:43:11.865 --> 00:43:14.105
It is time you handed her over.

00:43:14.805 --> 00:43:19.035
- U Hui does not belong to you. - Yes. She is mine.

00:43:20.245 --> 00:43:24.515
My most useful possession.

00:43:29.745 --> 00:43:33.055
I will not allow anyone to use her as a pawn.

00:43:39.925 --> 00:43:42.195
- Seize him! - Household Man.

00:43:58.645 --> 00:43:59.645
No!

00:44:14.795 --> 00:44:16.295
- No! - Darn it.

00:44:40.955 --> 00:44:43.655
- Grand Prince! - My lady!

00:44:44.725 --> 00:44:45.895
My lord...

00:44:58.605 --> 00:45:03.345
You are nothing like the Late King, Grand Prince Je Un.

00:45:04.115 --> 00:45:07.945
The Late King was never this recklessly brave.

00:45:08.685 --> 00:45:10.355
He had many things he held more dear...

00:45:11.555 --> 00:45:14.025
than your mother.

00:45:15.485 --> 00:45:16.795
He was quite the coward too.

00:45:17.595 --> 00:45:20.065
As if assassinating my Royal Father was not enough,

00:45:20.695 --> 00:45:24.865
now you dare insult his honour as well!

00:45:24.935 --> 00:45:28.965
Honour? Did the Late King ever have any to begin with?

00:45:29.205 --> 00:45:30.905
Left State Councillor!

00:45:32.805 --> 00:45:34.105
Left State Councillor!

00:45:35.745 --> 00:45:37.775
Going after family is a low blow, is it not?

00:45:47.855 --> 00:45:49.755
And going after a royal is high treason.

00:45:51.225 --> 00:45:53.825
Back off. Unless you want to lose your heads.

00:46:11.375 --> 00:46:15.385
You are too bold for a cornered man, Left State Councillor.

00:46:15.785 --> 00:46:19.085
Do I seem cornered to you?

00:46:19.285 --> 00:46:21.124
The Crown Princess Consort eloped at night with a man.

00:46:21.125 --> 00:46:22.885
I would say that is a big problem.

00:46:23.595 --> 00:46:25.295
It is all over for you.

00:46:25.425 --> 00:46:26.725
The palace must have realised by now...

00:46:26.925 --> 00:46:29.495
the Crown Princess Consort has run away.

00:46:30.265 --> 00:46:33.465
Even if you drag her back, can she still become the Crown Princess?

00:46:34.065 --> 00:46:36.835
Even if you go back, both you and your daughter...

00:46:37.335 --> 00:46:39.135
will just be throwing your lives away.

00:46:40.145 --> 00:46:41.575
Throwing our lives away?

00:46:42.145 --> 00:46:46.215
So can you not just let them be happy together?

00:46:46.715 --> 00:46:49.915
She is your daughter, after all.

00:46:53.385 --> 00:46:54.385
That is precisely why...

00:46:56.955 --> 00:46:59.555
I cannot tolerate this.

00:47:01.425 --> 00:47:03.365
The fact that something of mine...

00:47:04.095 --> 00:47:06.835
dared to turn its blade on me.

00:47:10.905 --> 00:47:11.905
U Hui.

00:47:14.005 --> 00:47:15.975
If my daughter were to die here,

00:47:16.605 --> 00:47:18.515
no one would know...

00:47:20.085 --> 00:47:22.385
whether she eloped...

00:47:23.115 --> 00:47:25.485
- or if Prince Je Un kidnapped her. - Left State Councillor!

00:47:25.555 --> 00:47:26.855
You know very well...

00:47:28.125 --> 00:47:31.495
that I still wield that much power, do you not?

00:47:33.425 --> 00:47:34.695
The Left State Councillor...

00:47:35.295 --> 00:47:37.695
possesses a secret pact that I wrote with my own hand.

00:48:00.925 --> 00:48:01.925
I...

00:48:04.195 --> 00:48:05.755
will be the one to accept punishment.

00:48:08.925 --> 00:48:09.925
Gang.

00:48:11.135 --> 00:48:13.235
I will take the punishment.

00:48:15.835 --> 00:48:17.705
U Hui must not die.

00:48:18.905 --> 00:48:20.945
She cannot die because of me.

00:48:22.345 --> 00:48:23.415
Please...

00:48:24.815 --> 00:48:26.545
just put down the sword.

00:48:40.595 --> 00:48:41.795
Do you really wish...

00:48:43.595 --> 00:48:45.735
for blood to be spilled here?

00:48:46.905 --> 00:48:48.735
Whether I live or die,

00:48:50.135 --> 00:48:52.575
both sides stand to lose something precious.

00:48:54.975 --> 00:48:58.445
Let us put this behind us and call a truce for now.

00:48:58.975 --> 00:48:59.975
U Hui.

00:49:02.315 --> 00:49:03.485
What do you say?

00:49:12.825 --> 00:49:14.265
We will do as she says.

00:49:22.705 --> 00:49:23.905
Escort the Crown Princess Consort.

00:49:28.145 --> 00:49:29.145
U Hui.

00:49:30.105 --> 00:49:31.875
I suppose what you held in your hands...

00:49:33.485 --> 00:49:35.245
was not the key to my father's downfall...

00:49:38.355 --> 00:49:40.055
but simply a foolish dream.

00:49:40.685 --> 00:49:41.685
U Hui...

00:49:54.105 --> 00:49:55.105
U Hui.

00:50:07.285 --> 00:50:08.385
The Left State Councillor...

00:50:09.985 --> 00:50:11.815
How was he released?

00:50:13.625 --> 00:50:16.555
Why on earth was he let go?

00:50:17.855 --> 00:50:19.125
I will explain everything.

00:50:29.705 --> 00:50:31.035
So, you are saying...

00:50:31.605 --> 00:50:34.075
the Gyesa Year incident was a coup,

00:50:34.305 --> 00:50:35.875
and since it succeeded,

00:50:37.115 --> 00:50:40.345
the Left State Councillor is free of any crime or weakness.

00:50:40.515 --> 00:50:41.645
Is that what you are telling me?

00:50:44.015 --> 00:50:45.115
I am so sorry.

00:50:45.755 --> 00:50:47.185
He may have been coerced,

00:50:48.155 --> 00:50:50.395
but it was cowardice for our Royal Father to ignore...

00:50:51.195 --> 00:50:52.755
the Left State Councillor's crimes...

00:50:53.925 --> 00:50:55.125
and a great sin against you.

00:50:57.865 --> 00:50:59.995
How could that be your fault?

00:51:01.405 --> 00:51:02.405
It is just that...

00:51:03.365 --> 00:51:06.875
I cannot bring myself to say that it is all okay today.

00:51:08.005 --> 00:51:10.745
I told her not to hold back anymore,

00:51:11.845 --> 00:51:14.315
but U Hui could not show any anger in the end.

00:51:15.015 --> 00:51:16.715
She could not even cry in my arms.

00:51:19.755 --> 00:51:21.825
She just held it all in as she left.

00:51:43.815 --> 00:51:46.475
Why are you so obsessed with becoming the King's in-law?

00:51:47.385 --> 00:51:48.985
You already have everything.

00:51:49.445 --> 00:51:51.755
So why do you covet that position so desperately?

00:51:53.355 --> 00:51:54.425
I am just curious.

00:51:54.955 --> 00:51:56.425
Because I want to be powerful.

00:51:56.785 --> 00:51:57.925
How much more powerful?

00:51:58.225 --> 00:52:00.365
To allow anyone to be more powerful than me...

00:52:01.165 --> 00:52:04.165
is to be prepared to give up everything I have.

00:52:06.235 --> 00:52:07.565
I wanted power,

00:52:08.465 --> 00:52:10.475
so I placed first in the military service examination.

00:52:12.605 --> 00:52:14.975
Even when I thought I had become powerful enough,

00:52:15.745 --> 00:52:17.945
I was still weak in the presence of the King.

00:52:18.475 --> 00:52:19.845
And even that powerful King...

00:52:21.185 --> 00:52:23.445
was rendered powerless by the Queen's Family.

00:52:24.685 --> 00:52:26.955
So you decided to become one of the Queen's Family?

00:52:28.355 --> 00:52:29.655
To become the most powerful of all?

00:52:29.955 --> 00:52:31.025
Power...

00:52:32.995 --> 00:52:35.895
is harder to keep than it is to seize.

00:52:40.265 --> 00:52:43.405
So, it is time to wake up from this foolish dream...

00:52:44.935 --> 00:52:46.305
and live like a flower.

00:52:47.445 --> 00:52:49.005
You will take root in this palace.

00:52:49.605 --> 00:52:53.315
You will bloom when I tell you to, and you will wither on my command.

00:52:54.745 --> 00:52:55.845
If you do just that,

00:52:57.855 --> 00:52:59.685
that will be a life well-lived.

00:53:13.035 --> 00:53:14.404
Bar the gates to the Detached Palace...

00:53:14.405 --> 00:53:16.605
and confine the Crown Princess Consort until the Royal Wedding.

00:53:17.075 --> 00:53:18.334
If Crown Princess Consort ever steps foot outside...

00:53:18.335 --> 00:53:19.675
the Detached Palace,

00:53:20.705 --> 00:53:22.745
for every step she takes,

00:53:23.715 --> 00:53:27.045
one of the palace's court attendants will be beheaded.

00:53:28.385 --> 00:53:29.815
Yes, Left State Councillor.

00:53:39.995 --> 00:53:43.735
Grand Prince Je Un must be heartbroken.

00:53:46.235 --> 00:53:50.105
I did not even know my Royal Father made such a secret pact,

00:53:51.875 --> 00:53:54.145
and I was running my mouth about us getting revenge together.

00:53:55.405 --> 00:53:57.045
I must look like a complete fool.

00:53:57.475 --> 00:54:00.785
But you did not know. Why are you blaming yourself again?

00:54:01.145 --> 00:54:03.085
I want to take down the Left State Councillor,

00:54:06.455 --> 00:54:08.155
but I just do not know how.

00:54:25.905 --> 00:54:27.845
You need to get a grip.

00:54:29.205 --> 00:54:32.115
Open your eyes and see who your real enemy is.

00:54:32.545 --> 00:54:36.815
See exactly where you need to aim your bow.

00:54:38.415 --> 00:54:40.415
Do not get bogged down by all this useless guilt...

00:54:41.655 --> 00:54:43.955
and let it eat you up inside.

00:54:44.855 --> 00:54:46.455
You must be strong.

00:54:47.295 --> 00:54:50.365
If the path is blocked, you force your way through.

00:54:51.365 --> 00:54:54.965
And if there is no path, who cares? Just build a new one.

00:54:55.865 --> 00:54:58.105
And most importantly, do not ever forget...

00:54:58.575 --> 00:55:01.905
that I, your swallow, will always be by your side.

00:55:02.745 --> 00:55:03.745
Right?

00:55:10.715 --> 00:55:11.715
Do you understand?

00:55:14.725 --> 00:55:17.155
And who said you could just grab the Crown Prince's face like that?

00:55:19.025 --> 00:55:20.095
My apologies.

00:55:23.265 --> 00:55:26.665
But did you not say I was the exception?

00:55:27.905 --> 00:55:30.065
What, are you a mind reader now?

00:55:30.905 --> 00:55:34.775
You know exactly what I am thinking without me saying a word.

00:55:36.345 --> 00:55:37.475
Mind reading?

00:55:38.345 --> 00:55:39.345
That is right.

00:55:39.675 --> 00:55:44.055
Go on then. Keep reading my mind.

00:55:48.925 --> 00:55:50.285
Mind reading.

00:56:05.505 --> 00:56:09.145
Your Royal Highness. I heard you were feeling unwell.

00:56:09.875 --> 00:56:12.015
Are you fully recovered now?

00:56:12.675 --> 00:56:14.815
Yes, more or less.

00:56:15.345 --> 00:56:16.614
Your Highness, as the misunderstanding...

00:56:16.615 --> 00:56:18.915
with the Left State Councillor has been cleared,

00:56:19.055 --> 00:56:22.985
it is time to close the case on the Jimjo incident.

00:56:23.725 --> 00:56:24.755
The Jimjo...

00:56:25.295 --> 00:56:28.965
was raised by the former Chief Court Lady Jo alone.

00:56:29.665 --> 00:56:31.635
As for her niece who framed the Royal Concubine,

00:56:32.165 --> 00:56:33.835
she will be exiled and made a government slave.

00:56:34.105 --> 00:56:35.305
And with that, the Jimjo incident...

00:56:38.775 --> 00:56:40.075
is hereby closed.

00:56:40.805 --> 00:56:42.745
- Yes, Your Royal Highness! - Yes, Your Royal Highness!

00:56:44.745 --> 00:56:47.685
Your Royal Highness, this prolonged drought...

00:56:47.785 --> 00:56:50.285
is causing our people immense suffering.

00:56:50.615 --> 00:56:54.225
This drought persists because yin and yang are unbalanced.

00:56:54.485 --> 00:56:56.685
Proceeding with the Royal Wedding without delay...

00:56:57.895 --> 00:56:59.825
is the correct course of action.

00:57:00.225 --> 00:57:01.465
Yes, Your Highness.

00:57:01.495 --> 00:57:04.735
The Royal Wedding must go on to stabilize ancestors and state.

00:57:05.095 --> 00:57:08.335
And appease the skies.

00:57:23.145 --> 00:57:26.184
They say a puppy will not fear a tiger.

00:57:26.185 --> 00:57:27.354
And that fits him perfectly.

00:57:27.355 --> 00:57:28.685
I knew he would tuck his tail and run.

00:57:29.285 --> 00:57:33.595
How dare he arrest the Left State Councillor?

00:57:35.725 --> 00:57:37.495
You can rest easy now.

00:57:38.335 --> 00:57:40.665
The Royal Wedding is right around the corner.

00:57:41.205 --> 00:57:45.275
This is a day to celebrate your win. Why are you so quiet?

00:57:46.635 --> 00:57:48.245
We should at least go to Eunwol Pavilion.

00:57:49.445 --> 00:57:51.574
Goodness. Why is it always...

00:57:51.575 --> 00:57:53.615
the courtesan house with you, Minister Ja Gyeong?

00:57:55.115 --> 00:57:57.115
Do you think I am suggesting it for no reason?

00:57:57.885 --> 00:57:59.455
The other day, at Eunwol Pavilion,

00:58:00.185 --> 00:58:01.725
I saw Hong Nan.

00:58:03.155 --> 00:58:05.995
- The gisaeng from Eunwol Pavilion? - Yes.

00:58:06.155 --> 00:58:08.165
Did she not suddenly disappear a few years ago?

00:58:08.295 --> 00:58:11.195
See? I knew you would be interested.

00:58:11.535 --> 00:58:13.595
Maybe she got kicked out of her concubine's position.

00:58:14.035 --> 00:58:17.335
- She was back at Eunwol Pavilion. - A concubine?

00:58:18.175 --> 00:58:20.135
Were she and the late deposed Crown Princess's brother...

00:58:20.435 --> 00:58:22.105
not madly in love with each other?

00:58:22.475 --> 00:58:26.415
After he died, she sold everything, left the registry, and vanished.

00:58:26.545 --> 00:58:30.085
What? She turned down my offer for some worthless guy?

00:58:30.645 --> 00:58:31.655
Unbelievable.

00:58:32.155 --> 00:58:33.155
Wait.

00:58:34.425 --> 00:58:36.285
Did you just say the deposed Crown Princess's brother?

00:58:37.155 --> 00:58:38.325
Yes.

00:58:38.595 --> 00:58:39.855
What is it?

00:58:41.295 --> 00:58:42.365
This could be...

00:58:43.095 --> 00:58:45.895
something much bigger.

00:58:46.835 --> 00:58:48.705
Something that gives us leverage over the Crown Prince.

00:58:50.435 --> 00:58:51.435
Something huge.

00:58:57.005 --> 00:58:59.915
Find out all you can about a gisaeng from Eunwol Pavilion named Hong Nan,

00:59:00.245 --> 00:59:01.385
and find out where she's staying.

00:59:01.915 --> 00:59:02.915
Yes, sir.

00:59:06.185 --> 00:59:07.585
Do you have something to report?

00:59:08.255 --> 00:59:10.725
It is about the Royal Concubine's neighbours from Boryeong.

00:59:13.655 --> 00:59:16.025
- I have taken care of them. - Good.

00:59:16.425 --> 00:59:17.435
You may go.

00:59:23.905 --> 00:59:24.975
If...

00:59:25.405 --> 00:59:27.475
the Royal Concubine is actually the deposed Crown Princess,

00:59:28.505 --> 00:59:31.445
then there is only one person who could have gotten her out.

00:59:34.945 --> 00:59:36.485
This is absurd.

00:59:36.785 --> 00:59:38.315
The Crown Princess Consort ran away.

00:59:38.485 --> 00:59:40.355
Her whole family should face annihilation for this.

00:59:40.455 --> 00:59:41.725
And you are telling me there will be a Royal Wedding?

00:59:43.025 --> 00:59:44.754
The King has confined the Crown Princess Consort...

00:59:44.755 --> 00:59:46.255
to the Detached Palace until the Royal Wedding.

00:59:46.555 --> 00:59:49.395
He also ordered her to be cut off from all outside contact.

00:59:51.335 --> 00:59:53.234
By law, the Crown Princess Consort is not allowed to leave...

00:59:53.235 --> 00:59:56.265
the Detached Palace to begin with.

00:59:56.435 --> 00:59:59.875
Are you trying to deceive me? What is the meaning of this?

01:00:00.235 --> 01:00:02.175
Your Majesty, you seem to have misunderstood.

01:00:02.545 --> 01:00:05.145
The Crown Princess Consort did not run away.

01:00:05.745 --> 01:00:06.915
She collapsed.

01:00:08.245 --> 01:00:11.585
And she just had to collapse outside of the Detached Palace?

01:00:12.115 --> 01:00:15.055
- For that long? - When her father was arrested,

01:00:15.425 --> 01:00:19.325
I let her go, fearing she would be sick with worry over her father.

01:00:19.555 --> 01:00:22.725
She collapsed in shock on the way, recovering at a private house.

01:00:22.895 --> 01:00:24.234
The story must have been distorted.

01:00:24.235 --> 01:00:25.595
You create a problem to fix it?

01:00:26.635 --> 01:00:28.535
It was you who ordered the Left State Councillor's arrest,

01:00:28.905 --> 01:00:30.435
was it not?

01:00:33.375 --> 01:00:34.705
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

01:00:39.015 --> 01:00:40.675
What in the world is going on?

01:00:40.845 --> 01:00:42.515
Why are His Majesty and you...

01:00:42.845 --> 01:00:44.955
so helpless against the Left State Councillor?

01:00:45.315 --> 01:00:47.115
What kind of leverage does he have on you...

01:00:47.725 --> 01:00:51.095
that makes you continue with this absurd charade?

01:00:53.895 --> 01:00:55.295
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

01:00:56.325 --> 01:00:59.235
If you will just keep repeating "forgive me" like a parrot,

01:01:00.095 --> 01:01:01.135
then get out.

01:01:04.635 --> 01:01:05.675
Then,

01:01:06.235 --> 01:01:07.645
I shall take my leave.

01:01:15.745 --> 01:01:16.815
Crown Prince.

01:01:19.855 --> 01:01:22.385
We have both lost people, have we not?

01:01:23.185 --> 01:01:24.595
People we held dear.

01:01:29.725 --> 01:01:31.795
Are you going to let fear paralyse you...

01:01:32.865 --> 01:01:33.965
and walk right back into...

01:01:34.535 --> 01:01:36.605
that fiery pit again?

01:02:00.925 --> 01:02:02.065
The Left State Councillor...

01:02:02.565 --> 01:02:05.565
Why on earth was he let go?

01:02:08.305 --> 01:02:10.005
I was a prisoner of that secret pact.

01:02:11.205 --> 01:02:13.035
For years, my life was a living nightmare.

01:02:14.275 --> 01:02:17.145
Royal Mother! What is happening?

01:02:18.115 --> 01:02:19.115
Royal Mother.

01:02:26.215 --> 01:02:28.655
We have both lost people, have we not?

01:02:29.585 --> 01:02:31.055
People we held dear.

01:02:32.295 --> 01:02:34.395
Are you going to let fear paralyse you...

01:02:35.195 --> 01:02:36.265
and walk right back into...

01:02:36.465 --> 01:02:38.635
that fiery pit again?

01:02:44.905 --> 01:02:46.375
You must be strong.

01:02:47.275 --> 01:02:48.545
If your path is blocked,

01:02:49.075 --> 01:02:50.345
you force your way through.

01:02:51.315 --> 01:02:54.845
And if there is no path, who cares? Just build a new one.

01:03:05.595 --> 01:03:07.395
Abdicate the throne to Grand Prince Je Un.

01:03:07.725 --> 01:03:11.235
Then, Your Majesty, you must reveal the secret pact yourself.

01:03:11.635 --> 01:03:13.935
Do you have any idea what will happen if I do?

01:03:14.305 --> 01:03:16.035
It would not be an abdication. You would be dethroned.

01:03:16.365 --> 01:03:18.005
And not just Your Majesty, but I, too,

01:03:18.805 --> 01:03:20.275
will be dragged down into the abyss.

01:03:20.435 --> 01:03:22.245
You know that, and you still dare say such a thing?

01:03:23.675 --> 01:03:25.974
You think I like having the Left State Councillor around?

01:03:25.975 --> 01:03:27.315
If he falls,

01:03:27.645 --> 01:03:29.915
then I, who led a coup without just cause,

01:03:30.445 --> 01:03:32.685
and you will have no one left to protect us.

01:03:32.985 --> 01:03:34.955
They will all be scrambling to tear us down.

01:03:35.355 --> 01:03:39.525
If Je Un takes the throne, he will claim to avenge the Late King.

01:03:39.755 --> 01:03:41.525
Which means he will have to kill both you and me.

01:03:41.725 --> 01:03:45.695
So you will just sit there, weighing the consequences,

01:03:45.765 --> 01:03:47.165
and do absolutely nothing?

01:03:48.765 --> 01:03:50.635
Did you not say it yourself, Your Majesty?

01:03:51.375 --> 01:03:53.005
That you have been living in a nightmare since that day.

01:03:54.035 --> 01:03:56.075
Anything has to be better than nightmare, right?

01:03:57.145 --> 01:03:59.075
We should return what we took unjustly...

01:03:59.375 --> 01:04:01.685
and take back what was stolen from us.

01:04:02.315 --> 01:04:05.585
I will prove you signed the pact under duress,

01:04:06.455 --> 01:04:08.125
and I will destroy the Left State Councillor!

01:04:10.325 --> 01:04:12.525
This reckless path you are on.

01:04:14.525 --> 01:04:15.995
Is it because of the Royal Concubine?

01:04:16.625 --> 01:04:17.895
I am doing this for myself.

01:04:19.635 --> 01:04:21.805
I failed to protect my mother, and the Crown Princess.

01:04:23.135 --> 01:04:24.165
If I...

01:04:25.305 --> 01:04:27.005
lose the woman I love again,

01:04:28.745 --> 01:04:29.905
I will die.

01:04:33.215 --> 01:04:36.015
My mind is made up. So,

01:04:37.515 --> 01:04:39.585
I ask that you make yours, Your Majesty.

01:04:46.555 --> 01:04:49.295
If the Crown Prince confronts the Left State Councillor,

01:04:51.565 --> 01:04:53.794
the Left State Councillor will target the Royal Concubine first,

01:04:53.795 --> 01:04:54.865
seeing her as his weakness.

01:04:57.665 --> 01:04:59.035
That is the kind of man he is.

01:05:02.845 --> 01:05:04.305
I must see Hong Nan.

01:05:14.685 --> 01:05:16.855
The Crown Princess, whom I thought dead,

01:05:18.725 --> 01:05:20.395
has returned as the Royal Concubine.

01:05:23.865 --> 01:05:25.265
Was this your doing?

01:05:25.695 --> 01:05:26.795
Her Highness...

01:05:27.295 --> 01:05:29.665
threw herself into the icy water five years ago.

01:05:31.375 --> 01:05:33.435
She lost all of her memories then.

01:05:34.605 --> 01:05:35.605
So I...

01:05:36.545 --> 01:05:38.575
made everyone believe she was dead.

01:05:39.315 --> 01:05:40.715
She lost her memories?

01:05:41.715 --> 01:05:43.515
Why would the Crown Princess make such a choice?

01:05:43.915 --> 01:05:46.055
- I distinctly... - You gave her a letter.

01:05:46.885 --> 01:05:48.754
A letter to fake her death and flee...

01:05:48.755 --> 01:05:50.625
the day before she would be poisoned.

01:05:51.755 --> 01:05:53.494
You knew exactly how the Crown Prince...

01:05:53.495 --> 01:05:55.125
and the Crown Princess felt for one another,

01:05:55.695 --> 01:05:58.735
yet what you gave her that day was not a letter.

01:05:58.795 --> 01:06:02.235
It was to ease your pathetic guilt. And that...

01:06:03.765 --> 01:06:05.175
was a death sentence,

01:06:06.335 --> 01:06:09.605
- not a chance to live! - You insolent wench! How dare you?

01:06:09.705 --> 01:06:13.345
Fine. Since I am already insolent, I will say what I have to say.

01:06:13.945 --> 01:06:16.685
Did you truly wish for Her Highness to escape...

01:06:17.285 --> 01:06:19.285
and live on safely?

01:06:20.215 --> 01:06:23.385
Or were you just hoping she would take her own life for you?

01:06:29.465 --> 01:06:30.465
Your Majesty.

01:06:34.065 --> 01:06:35.065
This time,

01:06:38.335 --> 01:06:40.035
you must save Her Highness.

01:06:42.045 --> 01:06:43.505
It has been ages since we had meat!

01:06:43.545 --> 01:06:44.715
Eat up.

01:06:48.485 --> 01:06:49.545
Hong Nan.

01:06:50.115 --> 01:06:51.385
Come have a bite.

01:06:52.055 --> 01:06:53.215
I am fine, thank you.

01:06:53.885 --> 01:06:57.185
More importantly, after you eat, you need to pack your things.

01:06:57.485 --> 01:06:58.925
We are leaving for Qing.

01:07:05.695 --> 01:07:08.265
Technically speaking, to the Crown Prince,

01:07:08.335 --> 01:07:10.365
we are his parents-in-law.

01:07:11.305 --> 01:07:12.775
Sorry to bring this up while we are eating.

01:07:13.275 --> 01:07:15.674
When you buy a house, you get the outhouse too.

01:07:15.675 --> 01:07:17.075
They just took our Dal,

01:07:17.145 --> 01:07:21.045
and now they are exiling us to Qing. That is not right.

01:07:21.515 --> 01:07:23.485
- Just eat. - All right.

01:07:24.415 --> 01:07:25.615
Well...

01:07:26.885 --> 01:07:27.885
But why?

01:07:28.685 --> 01:07:31.255
Is it because we are a runaway court lady and eunuch?

01:07:31.695 --> 01:07:34.295
Are we a burden to Dal?

01:07:34.895 --> 01:07:36.825
Dal is coming with us.

01:07:37.425 --> 01:07:38.435
What?

01:07:39.335 --> 01:07:41.135
Are you still half asleep?

01:07:41.765 --> 01:07:44.735
She is the Royal Concubine. Why would she go to Qing?

01:07:53.515 --> 01:07:54.615
The truth is, Dal...

01:07:55.985 --> 01:07:57.615
is the supposedly...

01:07:58.385 --> 01:07:59.855
the deceased Crown Princess.

01:08:04.085 --> 01:08:05.095
My goodness.

01:08:17.105 --> 01:08:18.335
I heard that your family...

01:08:19.705 --> 01:08:21.845
is staying at Unjeong Palace.

01:08:22.505 --> 01:08:23.675
My apologies, Your Majesty.

01:08:25.215 --> 01:08:26.715
I did not summon you here to reprimand you.

01:08:27.875 --> 01:08:29.385
However, it is against palace protocol,

01:08:30.345 --> 01:08:32.015
so I will arrange a separate residence for them.

01:08:32.685 --> 01:08:34.255
Go and discuss it with your family.

01:08:34.685 --> 01:08:35.755
Thank you, Your Majesty.

01:08:37.125 --> 01:08:38.755
However, we must be mindful of prying eyes,

01:08:40.155 --> 01:08:41.525
so be discreet.

01:08:41.795 --> 01:08:42.895
Yes, Your Majesty.

01:08:45.135 --> 01:08:47.395
Then I shall take my leave.

01:08:52.375 --> 01:08:53.435
My dear.

01:09:00.515 --> 01:09:01.615
In a commoner's home,

01:09:03.585 --> 01:09:05.285
is that not what they call a daughter-in-law?

01:09:06.785 --> 01:09:09.085
I just wanted to call you that once.

01:09:12.725 --> 01:09:13.855
You may go.

01:09:22.335 --> 01:09:23.765
For your thoughtfulness,

01:09:24.535 --> 01:09:25.935
I am sincerely grateful.

01:09:54.465 --> 01:09:55.465
The Crown Prince's Concubine.

01:09:56.205 --> 01:09:57.235
No.

01:09:59.035 --> 01:10:00.335
Kill the Crown Princess.

01:10:03.205 --> 01:10:04.975
Set fire to the Royal Concubine's quarters...

01:10:05.845 --> 01:10:07.775
and place a body of a similar build inside.

01:10:08.645 --> 01:10:11.315
I must make the Crown Princess dead to the world once more.

01:10:38.745 --> 01:10:40.015
Welcome, Your Highness, the Crown Princess.

01:10:40.675 --> 01:10:44.045
Goodness. My apologies. Welcome, Royal Concubine.

01:10:46.355 --> 01:10:47.555
It is all right.

01:10:48.325 --> 01:10:50.455
But do I really look that much like her?

01:10:50.825 --> 01:10:53.025
Why is everyone so shocked when they see me?

01:10:55.025 --> 01:10:58.495
With a mole on your nose, you would be her spitting image.

01:10:59.135 --> 01:11:00.335
A mole?

01:11:05.605 --> 01:11:07.205
Once every 3 months, for 15 minutes,

01:11:07.575 --> 01:11:09.075
you must cover the mole on your nose.

01:11:09.475 --> 01:11:12.415
No one should ever recognise you.

01:11:14.275 --> 01:11:17.085
Hong Nan has stepped out for a moment,

01:11:17.145 --> 01:11:18.655
so please come inside for now.

01:11:19.085 --> 01:11:22.085
- The sun is scorching. Come. - Sure.

01:11:40.405 --> 01:11:41.905
Are you upset about...

01:11:42.505 --> 01:11:44.075
what the servant said earlier?

01:11:45.475 --> 01:11:46.475
No.

01:11:47.345 --> 01:11:49.945
What do you mean, "no"? It is written all over your face.

01:11:50.785 --> 01:11:51.955
I told you, I am not.

01:12:01.125 --> 01:12:03.765
Yeon Sim, I bet your first love is going to come true.

01:12:04.995 --> 01:12:06.965
Are you praying for my execution?

01:12:07.235 --> 01:12:09.835
If a court lady's first love comes true, she loses her head.

01:12:10.135 --> 01:12:12.705
Gosh. That is not what I meant.

01:12:13.735 --> 01:12:15.975
In that case, may you live a long and single life.

01:12:17.375 --> 01:12:19.715
- Is that meant to be a blessing? - Of course it is.

01:12:21.145 --> 01:12:23.815
But what do flower petals have to do with first love, anyway?

01:12:24.685 --> 01:12:25.785
You do not know?

01:12:26.155 --> 01:12:29.825
- Catch a petal, your first love... - Do you know the saying?

01:12:32.195 --> 01:12:34.195
If you happen to catch a falling flower petal,

01:12:34.695 --> 01:12:35.924
do you know what happens?

01:12:35.925 --> 01:12:37.665
If you catch a falling petal,

01:12:39.995 --> 01:12:41.365
your first love will come true.

01:13:01.755 --> 01:13:02.955
This one thing...

01:13:03.655 --> 01:13:04.855
is mine.

01:13:21.575 --> 01:13:22.575
Mangdeok.

01:13:29.015 --> 01:13:30.015
Your Highness.

01:13:40.995 --> 01:13:41.995
Come here.

01:13:43.225 --> 01:13:44.625
Gently piling up.

01:13:44.935 --> 01:13:47.395
It is as if little blessings are piling up like snow.

01:13:48.705 --> 01:13:50.905
Does it not feel like a promise of happiness?

01:14:00.475 --> 01:14:01.475
My lord!

01:14:04.445 --> 01:14:06.055
Your small blessing for today.

01:14:09.925 --> 01:14:11.355
It is so beautiful.

01:14:13.625 --> 01:14:14.795
It truly is.

01:14:26.005 --> 01:14:28.275
Your Highness. Are you all right?

01:14:28.475 --> 01:14:29.905
You are the sole exception.

01:14:32.375 --> 01:14:33.545
This one thing...

01:14:35.115 --> 01:14:36.285
is mine.

01:14:44.025 --> 01:14:45.025
Your Highness.

01:14:45.555 --> 01:14:46.555
Your Highness.

01:14:49.825 --> 01:14:53.835
The King will order you poison. You must flee now, Your Highness!

01:15:00.135 --> 01:15:01.675
Hong Nan...

01:15:06.415 --> 01:15:08.215
Why did you deceive me?

01:15:16.655 --> 01:15:17.725
Why?

01:15:28.865 --> 01:15:33.635
(Moon River)

01:15:48.955 --> 01:15:51.355
Have your memories returned?

01:15:51.685 --> 01:15:55.125
The memories are back, but I am completely lost.

01:15:55.225 --> 01:15:57.094
You want me to overthrow you and His Majesty...

01:15:57.095 --> 01:15:58.865
and take the throne for myself?

01:15:58.995 --> 01:16:01.665
Look at this mess the Left State Councillor has caused.

01:16:01.805 --> 01:16:04.004
The Left State Councillor is a scary man.

01:16:04.005 --> 01:16:05.935
He will harm the Crown Princess, no matter what.

01:16:06.005 --> 01:16:07.835
What are you talking about?

01:16:08.135 --> 01:16:10.845
There is no time. You have to escape.

01:16:10.905 --> 01:16:12.674
I despise the royals who killed my family.

01:16:12.675 --> 01:16:14.045
And I despise you too, Your Highness.

01:16:14.275 --> 01:16:17.345
I never want to see you again, Your Highness.

01:16:34.035 --> 01:16:38.105
