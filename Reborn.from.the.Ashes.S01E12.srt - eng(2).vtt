[Reborn from the Ashes]

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.440
[Episode 12]

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:23.190
I'm late.

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:24.960
Your Highness.

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:27.000
You've been wronged.

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:31.710
She's not the one who's been wronged.

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.550
She...

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:33.630
What?

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.520
The crown princess is unfaithful.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.070
She was promised to you,
but ran away with my cousin.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.960
When the truth came out,
she had my cousin killed.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.750
I couldn't bear to see you deceived.

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.400
So today, I want to reveal the truth.

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:50.150
But she beat me badly instead.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.230
You hit her?

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.070
Does it hurt?

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.880
Gong Shixian abducted my wife.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.710
I haven't even confronted you
about it yet.

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.230
Do you not take me seriously?

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:18.320
Your Highness, please spare us.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.110
We were misled by rumors,

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.000
and wronged the crown princess.

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.360
Since your matter is settled,

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:27.880
now it's time to settle ours.

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.480
You've bullied my wife so openly.

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.960
Are you disregarding

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.000
Prince Zhenbei's Mansion?

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:36.040
That's unjust, Your Highness.

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.710
It was the Madam who told me
to teach her manners.

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:40.440
I only pretended to do this.

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.670
Never would I disrespect her.

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.040
Gong Xi, how dare you!

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.520
How dare you frame me?

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:50.150
It was you who told me
to properly discipline her.

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.190
She's delicate and tender,

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.920
not built to endure your rough ways.

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:57.320
That's nonsense.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.480
I told you to teach her manners,

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.590
not to pour dog blood on her.

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:02.920
It is no big deal.

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.170
You didn't explain it clearly.
How can you blame me?

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:07.070
Alright then.

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:11.590
As long as my wife forgives you,
I won't hold it against you.

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:12.880
Qingran,

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:14.590
this is all just a misunderstanding.

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:16.440
You will forgive me, right?

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.120
I'm too tired to argue with you.

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:19.320
Lady Qingran,

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:20.800
you've finally returned.

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:22.230
I've missed you so much.

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:25.590
Oh? Didn't you say you wouldn't come?

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:27.810
You haven't even thanked me yet.

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:29.590
Thank you for what?

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:31.520
If I hadn't shown up in time,

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.630
you'd be covered in dog blood by now.

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:37.360
Even if you hadn't come,

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:38.840
I had my own ways.

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.960
That's true.

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.840
You always bring me

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:44.840
surprises.

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:28.040
My Lord,

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.260
Su Guang is tied up
with official duties tonight.

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:31.990
This is the perfect chance
for you to act.

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:38.670
My Lord,

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.000
when will you be back?

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:43.440
If someone catches me now,

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.670
my reputation will be ruined.

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:48.360
Well,

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:50.880
I might be drowned in a cage.

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:10.800
Where on earth did Su Guang
hide the account book?

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.400
Wanyan Jin? Why did he come here?

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:33.520
Come inside.

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:35.320
This way.

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:39.920
Hurry up.

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:47.400
I've missed you so much, you foxy lady.

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.440
You're always so impatient.

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.330
Between Su Guang and me,
who do you think is stronger?

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:55.960
What wild words are those?

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:59.710
How could that old fool compare to you?

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.400
Su Guang is naturally suspicious.
You embezzle silver little by little.

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:04.800
Where is Gong Xi?

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:16.150
Master.

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:19.230
What are you all doing here?

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:23.360
I just saw someone sneaking
into the residence,

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:24.710
so I followed quietly.

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:27.670
It turns out that it was someone
from your side.

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:29.360
It's a misunderstanding.

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:33.800
Concubine Gong really knows how to play,
a two-timing liar.

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:36.270
What kind of look is that in her eyes?

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:38.710
You leave now.

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:39.630
Alright.

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:46.000
How did things turn out?

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:47.920
Governor, rest assured.

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:50.400
Everything I arranged went smoothly.

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:54.110
There must be no mistakes this time.

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:56.960
Don't come looking for me
unless it's important.

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:58.150
Understood.

00:05:58.750 --> 00:05:59.670
Leave now.

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:39.190
What are you doing?

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:42.230
Oh.

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:45.230
I heard a noise outside the window
just now.

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:48.800
I was worried you might be startled,
so I came to check.

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:51.190
I was sound asleep a moment ago.

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:52.630
I didn't hear a thing.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.960
But you sneak around
in the middle of the night,

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:57.250
and gave me quite a scare.

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:02.190
You're not sleeping late at night.
You aren't up to something bad, are you?

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:06.400
Why do you think
I just did something wrong?

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:09.230
Don't you have a clear conscience?

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:12.780
Why are you wrapped up
in the bedding like that?

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:14.630
Obviously,

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:15.990
I loosened my clothes to sleep.

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:17.490
Wouldn't I be cold without the cover?

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:19.840
Since you are not asleep,

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:21.490
why not come out for a walk with me?

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:22.630
I don't want to go out.

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:24.670
Yes, you do.

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:33.710
I think you haven't rested well.

00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:35.750
Then I'll go out by myself.

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:41.520
Was the person in the study tonight
really Su Qingran?

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:49.000
What exactly

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:51.230
was Wanyan Jin looking for in the study?

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:53.590
Could it be

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:56.580
that Wanyan Lie discovered
Su Guang was hiding the account book,

00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:59.370
so he pretended to arrange a marriage
with the Su family,

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:00.440
using this as a ruse

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:04.040
to give Wanyan Jin a chance
to look for the account book?

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:05.710
Otherwise,

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.550
why would he not care
that I spent time in a brothel?

00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:20.920
My Lord,

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:23.570
we have found the man
who has an affair with Concubine Gong

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:24.470
is Ye Changyuan.

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:26.600
In truth, he is a black market merchant.

00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:27.880
We know very little

00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:29.270
about him.

00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:31.110
Ye Changyuan.

00:08:34.310 --> 00:08:35.110
So it was him.

00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:38.070
He's the one
who ruined Zhijin's entire life.

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:40.390
He pushed Zhijin straight into hell.

00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:41.680
Bai Ze,

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:43.720
keep a close watch on Su Guang.

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:46.600
Report to me at once
if anything unusual happens.

00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:49.040
I'm going to meet Ye Changyuan.

00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:50.000
Understood.

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:57.510
[Su Mansion]

00:08:57.510 --> 00:08:59.670
Today, I'll be returning
to Prince Zhenbei's Mansion.

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:02.600
Keep an eye on Su Mansion for me.

00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:04.350
If there is any sign of trouble,

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:05.710
you must inform me immediately.

00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:06.680
Remember

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:09.070
not to alert them prematurely.

00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:10.390
Mm.

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:11.680
My Lady, rest assured,

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:13.070
I'll keep a sharp watch for you.

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:14.880
By the way,

00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:16.560
there's something odd I noticed.

00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:19.840
I'm not sure if it'll help
with your investigation.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:20.680
What is it?

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:30.470
The other day, when I went home
to visit my family,

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:31.560
I met someone on the way.

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:33.840
She looks just like Concubine Gong's
former maidservant.

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:36.720
But that maidservant died
in an odd way later.

00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:39.840
I was really shocked
when I saw that person.

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:40.990
Is it possible in this world

00:09:40.990 --> 00:09:42.800
for two people to look exactly the same?

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.560
Can you find that person?

00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:46.190
I should be able to.

00:09:58.510 --> 00:10:00.720
Why are you staring at me like that?

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:04.560
Your Highness, Nanny Wang is here.

00:10:09.310 --> 00:10:09.960
Oh.

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:13.350
I just remembered
I have official business to attend to.

00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:16.110
Then go quickly.

00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:16.680
Go ahead.

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:19.230
Go ahead.

00:10:19.390 --> 00:10:19.800
Let's go.

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:25.040
I saw Ye Changyuan

00:10:25.050 --> 00:10:25.800
and Concubine Gong

00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:26.560
enter the inn.

00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:41.190
Today, Concubine Gong said she would
go out to buy Buddhist worship items,

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:43.070
I just felt something's off,

00:10:43.510 --> 00:10:44.720
so I decided to follow her.

00:10:45.310 --> 00:10:47.470
Sure enough, I discovered a big problem.

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:50.230
I saw her enter a room at an inn
in broad daylight.

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:52.190
That made me suspicious right away.

00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:53.560
So I waited quietly for a moment.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.160
Not long after, as expected,

00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:57.110
a strikingly handsome man appeared.

00:10:57.190 --> 00:10:58.760
He went into the same room with her.

00:11:00.350 --> 00:11:02.110
She really can't hold back at all.

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:04.470
You brought this on yourself.

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:15.760
Do you still remember Su Qingran?

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:16.840
Of course I do.

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:21.150
Never thought that village girl
would become the crown princess.

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:25.040
She's truly a disgrace
to Prince Zhenbei's Mansion.

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:27.800
Ever since Su Qingran came back,

00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:29.600
she's been opposing me at every turn.

00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:31.110
Changyuan,

00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:32.840
I need you to help me once more.

00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:34.560
With just a few words,

00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:37.960
I fooled this Su Qingran
until she was completely lost,

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:40.230
and then I sold he
to the Begonia House,

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:42.470
she still foolishly helped
count the money.

00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:45.230
With her kind of stupid brain,

00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:47.390
how could she possibly be your match?

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:51.430
Changyuan, you're truly impressive.

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:03.470
You two...

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:05.190
You shameless couple.

00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:07.070
Master, please hear me out.

00:12:17.390 --> 00:12:19.270
Did you kill my mother?

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:22.430
No.

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:24.150
Was it you who killed my mother?

00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:24.960
No.

00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:28.070
No?

00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:34.880
Speak.

00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:36.800
I was wrong, Ran. Please spare me.

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:38.880
I shouldn't have poisoned your mother,

00:12:39.510 --> 00:12:40.880
nor should I have framed you.

00:12:41.310 --> 00:12:43.470
I shouldn't have left you
to suffer in the countryside.

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:44.760
Qingran, I was wrong.

00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:47.190
I won't dare to do it again.

00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:49.880
You were wrong?

00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:52.350
I truly know I was wrong.

00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:19.920
Mother.

00:13:32.430 --> 00:13:33.920
You came just in time.

00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:37.800
Feiyi!

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:44.680
