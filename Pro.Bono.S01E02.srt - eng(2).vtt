PRO BONO

00:00:37.642 --> 00:00:38.476
Byeol.

00:00:40.728 --> 00:00:41.771
Byeol?

00:00:41.855 --> 00:00:42.772
-Byeol?
-Byeol!

00:00:42.856 --> 00:00:45.150
Hey, Byeol! Over here! Byeol!

00:00:45.233 --> 00:00:46.234
Mr. Kang!

00:00:46.317 --> 00:00:47.193
Byeol!

00:00:47.277 --> 00:00:48.653
-Byeol!
-Are you okay?

00:00:48.736 --> 00:00:50.363
Why did you fall down?

00:00:50.446 --> 00:00:52.866
You must have feeble legs.
You should've been careful!

00:00:53.366 --> 00:00:54.450
That hurts!

00:00:55.076 --> 00:00:58.580
Gi-ppeum, you shouldn't mention
one's physical weakness like that.

00:00:58.663 --> 00:01:01.166
It's okay. Having weak legs is fine.

00:01:01.249 --> 00:01:05.879
Now's not the time to make a fuss
about someone else's legs.

00:01:05.962 --> 00:01:06.963
Hey, you punk!

00:01:07.046 --> 00:01:08.173
How dare you!

00:01:08.256 --> 00:01:10.133
What are you doing to our client?

00:01:10.216 --> 00:01:12.510
"Client"? How can this mutt be a client?

00:01:12.594 --> 00:01:13.428
"Mutt"?

00:01:14.012 --> 00:01:16.097
Take back that derogatory term
for animals at once.

00:01:23.104 --> 00:01:24.397
Oh Jung-in!

00:01:28.443 --> 00:01:29.694
Byeol.

00:01:29.777 --> 00:01:32.113
-How scary it must have been!
-Goodness, Byeol!

00:01:32.196 --> 00:01:33.114
We were so worried.

00:01:36.284 --> 00:01:37.493
Hey, this isn't right!

00:01:37.577 --> 00:01:40.455
How could you send me
to that kind of place without asking me?

00:01:40.538 --> 00:01:42.081
What's "that kind of place"?

00:01:42.165 --> 00:01:44.000
Can you explain so I can understand?

00:01:44.083 --> 00:01:48.254
If you're a part of management,
give me a position that suits my career!

00:01:48.338 --> 00:01:51.257
Do you know how many chaebols
and National Assemblymen I've handled?

00:01:51.883 --> 00:01:53.635
Asking for one's opinion

00:01:53.718 --> 00:01:57.639
is only needed when one has
the ability to choose.

00:01:58.223 --> 00:02:00.308
Isn't it, Attorney Kang?

00:02:01.684 --> 00:02:02.560
What?

00:02:02.644 --> 00:02:05.521
If you're done, may I go now?

00:02:06.231 --> 00:02:09.692
I have a meeting.
I'm a part of management, you know.

00:02:12.695 --> 00:02:13.821
Is it raining outside?

00:02:15.281 --> 00:02:16.199
It's sunny though.

00:02:24.207 --> 00:02:26.876
Sorry, those tracksuit pants
are all I have here.

00:02:28.086 --> 00:02:30.129
Gosh, you're soaked up here too.

00:02:30.213 --> 00:02:32.048
Goodness gracious.

00:02:32.131 --> 00:02:33.716
-It's okay.
-Sorry?

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:34.717
I'll do it.

00:02:34.801 --> 00:02:38.012
Okay. Then, I'll quickly go
and get these to the dry cleaner.

00:02:38.096 --> 00:02:40.056
You look good in those pants.

00:02:43.184 --> 00:02:45.228
Let me assess the situation first.

00:02:45.937 --> 00:02:47.146
There has to be a reason.

00:02:48.273 --> 00:02:51.776
A reason why Oh & Partners,
Korea's most expensive law firm,

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:54.779
made a pro bono team
that doesn't make a single cent of profit.

00:02:54.862 --> 00:02:55.947
Hey, Byeol.

00:02:57.407 --> 00:02:58.282
Good girl.

00:02:59.701 --> 00:03:00.743
And…

00:03:01.244 --> 00:03:02.578
the reason why they sent me here.

00:03:10.294 --> 00:03:11.421
So, this mutt…

00:03:14.382 --> 00:03:17.427
So, on accusations
of stealing this client,

00:03:18.678 --> 00:03:19.846
you're being sued?

00:03:19.929 --> 00:03:23.891
Steal Byeol? That's ridiculous.

00:03:23.975 --> 00:03:26.060
We adopted Byeol,
and she's part of our family.

00:03:28.062 --> 00:03:31.357
So-yeon rescues abandoned dogs.

00:03:31.441 --> 00:03:33.985
After finding Byeol
roaming around without a collar--

00:03:34.068 --> 00:03:35.528
She couldn't find her guardian,

00:03:35.611 --> 00:03:39.490
so she asked the owner of the dog cafe
she worked part-time at to adopt her.

00:03:40.158 --> 00:03:42.410
But the former guardian showed up later.

00:03:42.493 --> 00:03:44.454
It's been a year and a half.

00:03:44.537 --> 00:03:47.498
How could they show up now
after not looking for her this whole time?

00:03:49.083 --> 00:03:50.501
People are fickle.

00:03:50.585 --> 00:03:53.046
When dogs get sick, they abandon them.

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:55.715
And when they get better
under their new guardians' care,

00:03:56.299 --> 00:03:59.802
some say, "It's mine,"
and insist on getting them back.

00:03:59.886 --> 00:04:01.721
At this rate, the legal process

00:04:01.804 --> 00:04:06.142
of rescuing and adopting stray dogs
will fall apart, Mr. Kang.

00:04:06.225 --> 00:04:10.021
That's right.
This is a really important case.

00:04:10.104 --> 00:04:12.565
We have to resolve it.

00:04:12.648 --> 00:04:13.733
At any cost.

00:04:17.445 --> 00:04:21.991
Right. Indeed, it's really important.

00:04:23.242 --> 00:04:26.662
From chaebol CEO trials
to a case of a stolen mutt…

00:04:28.748 --> 00:04:29.791
Our Byeol…

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.711
I won't let her go. Never!

00:04:33.795 --> 00:04:36.089
Never again!

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:38.716
"Again"?

00:04:39.342 --> 00:04:42.387
What was the dog's condition like
when you first found her?

00:04:43.012 --> 00:04:44.472
Byeol…

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:47.475
Her tail was drooped.

00:04:47.558 --> 00:04:49.685
It seemed she hadn't eaten
for a really long time.

00:04:49.769 --> 00:04:52.563
She didn't even bark
when I approached her.

00:04:52.647 --> 00:04:54.190
She looked really nervous

00:04:54.857 --> 00:04:55.942
and was having a hard time.

00:04:56.943 --> 00:04:58.236
Where did you find her?

00:04:58.319 --> 00:04:59.445
At Seongbukcheon Stream.

00:04:59.529 --> 00:05:01.697
When you found her,
she didn't have a collar

00:05:01.781 --> 00:05:03.533
-or a microchip, right?
-That's right.

00:05:03.616 --> 00:05:07.370
And since you rescue abandoned dogs,
you obviously followed proper procedure?

00:05:07.453 --> 00:05:08.621
Yes, of course.

00:05:09.622 --> 00:05:11.416
What is this procedure like?

00:05:12.125 --> 00:05:14.836
Right, this field would be new for you.

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:16.170
When you find an abandoned dog,

00:05:16.254 --> 00:05:18.339
according to Article 39
of the Animal Protection Act…

00:05:19.173 --> 00:05:20.675
It's written up there.

00:05:20.758 --> 00:05:21.968
You can read it as you listen.

00:05:22.051 --> 00:05:25.638
When you report to the local government
or an animal protection center,

00:05:25.721 --> 00:05:27.723
they issue an announcement
for at least a week.

00:05:27.807 --> 00:05:31.227
If the guardian doesn't show up
after ten days, they find a new…

00:05:32.353 --> 00:05:33.980
I want to tie those hands down.

00:05:34.063 --> 00:05:36.232
Can't she talk without moving her hands?

00:05:36.315 --> 00:05:38.234
…to obtain ownership legally.

00:05:43.531 --> 00:05:45.575
You're an expert in this field.

00:05:45.658 --> 00:05:49.120
They seem to be the new legal guardians.
What's the problem here?

00:05:49.203 --> 00:05:51.664
Even if the former guardian
makes a fuss now,

00:05:51.747 --> 00:05:53.207
there's no reason to be scared.

00:05:54.375 --> 00:06:00.006
That's true.
But they're making quite a big fuss.

00:06:01.299 --> 00:06:02.341
What on earth?

00:06:02.425 --> 00:06:03.384
My goodness.

00:06:03.926 --> 00:06:08.264
I'm sorry! Our Byeol is big in size,

00:06:08.347 --> 00:06:11.142
but she scares easily
and never bites people.

00:06:11.225 --> 00:06:12.810
Don't be afraid.

00:06:12.894 --> 00:06:14.729
She likes you, Mr. Kang.

00:06:14.812 --> 00:06:17.940
Dogs recognize good people right away.

00:06:18.024 --> 00:06:19.609
Right. Of course.

00:06:19.692 --> 00:06:20.902
I'm not much of a dog person--

00:06:20.985 --> 00:06:21.986
-Why?
-Oh, my gosh!

00:06:22.069 --> 00:06:23.404
-Byeol!
-Byeol!

00:06:24.113 --> 00:06:26.157
Look at her chase him
while wagging her tail.

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:27.575
Why does she keep following him?

00:06:28.492 --> 00:06:29.327
Byeol!

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:30.703
Look how happy she is.

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:39.670
First, I have to find a weak link

00:06:39.754 --> 00:06:41.380
to extract information.

00:06:43.049 --> 00:06:45.009
Mushrooms in a law firm?

00:06:47.845 --> 00:06:49.931
Is this guy a carpenter?

00:06:51.599 --> 00:06:53.684
-Don't let me interrupt.
-Okay.

00:07:01.192 --> 00:07:03.110
A lunatic and a film nerd.

00:07:04.111 --> 00:07:06.656
How did she even pass the bar?

00:07:10.493 --> 00:07:12.745
OVERCOMING DISCRIMINATION
AND STRIVING TOWARDS EQUALITY

00:07:13.788 --> 00:07:15.248
PATIENCE

00:07:18.876 --> 00:07:20.503
Geez, that stare.

00:07:21.587 --> 00:07:23.005
Anger's written all over her face.

00:07:25.883 --> 00:07:27.552
YOU CAN DO IT, JUN-U
WHAT? WORK HARDER

00:07:27.635 --> 00:07:29.345
HARD WORK WILL NEVER LET YOU DOWN

00:07:29.971 --> 00:07:30.888
Bingo.

00:07:33.307 --> 00:07:35.184
-Let's grab some coffee.
-Sorry?

00:07:35.768 --> 00:07:36.894
Coffee.

00:07:36.978 --> 00:07:37.812
Sounds good.

00:07:43.192 --> 00:07:45.403
You were the youngest
anti-corruption judge?

00:07:45.486 --> 00:07:47.321
And with just a high school diploma?

00:07:50.032 --> 00:07:52.827
-Sorry.
-Come on. Don't be sorry.

00:07:53.411 --> 00:07:56.038
Academic backgrounds
and credentials don't matter.

00:07:56.122 --> 00:07:57.623
All that matters is…

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:00.793
your hard work.

00:08:00.876 --> 00:08:03.296
Exactly! I knew it.
Hard work never lets you down.

00:08:04.005 --> 00:08:06.215
We've just met,
so I don't know if I should say this,

00:08:06.299 --> 00:08:10.094
but I can already tell
you won't be satisfied with staying here.

00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:13.180
You can see that?

00:08:13.264 --> 00:08:14.432
Of course.

00:08:14.515 --> 00:08:17.810
Why do you think Dr. Oh
sent me here to be the team leader?

00:08:18.644 --> 00:08:21.689
It's to find undiscovered talent.

00:08:21.772 --> 00:08:24.400
You're right. Please help me, Mr. Kang.

00:08:24.483 --> 00:08:26.861
Instead of being tucked away
in a dark corner,

00:08:26.944 --> 00:08:29.905
I want to work in an office like these

00:08:29.989 --> 00:08:32.408
that are filled with sunlight
and overlook Seoul.

00:08:33.492 --> 00:08:35.411
Yes, I'll look into that.

00:08:36.495 --> 00:08:39.248
By the way,
when was Team Pro Bono formed?

00:08:39.332 --> 00:08:40.583
This past March.

00:08:40.666 --> 00:08:44.545
March? That wasn't too long ago.
Where is everyone from?

00:08:45.171 --> 00:08:47.173
Nan-hui was a member
of a human rights club

00:08:47.256 --> 00:08:48.758
and came after finishing law school.

00:08:48.841 --> 00:08:50.134
As for Yeong-sil,

00:08:50.217 --> 00:08:52.887
he worked at various public organizations
before coming here.

00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:54.388
And I…

00:08:54.472 --> 00:08:56.390
You might not know it,

00:08:56.474 --> 00:08:59.935
but I worked at a law firm called Daebak.

00:09:00.019 --> 00:09:01.479
He's from some lousy firm.

00:09:01.562 --> 00:09:03.397
Ms. Park was the only internal applicant.

00:09:03.981 --> 00:09:06.359
An internal applicant?
Then, she's from Oh & Partners?

00:09:06.442 --> 00:09:07.860
Yes, she was part of the M&A team.

00:09:09.403 --> 00:09:11.822
Gosh, that team is
only for the best lawyers.

00:09:11.906 --> 00:09:14.450
Gi-ppeum is a pretty big nerd,

00:09:14.533 --> 00:09:17.620
so she acts weird sometimes,
but she is very talented.

00:09:17.703 --> 00:09:20.122
You'll be working mainly with her.

00:09:20.206 --> 00:09:21.374
I see.

00:09:21.457 --> 00:09:23.584
You said I'll be working

00:09:24.168 --> 00:09:26.087
with Park Gi-ppeum?

00:09:26.170 --> 00:09:30.091
Yeong-sil used to work with Ms. Park,
but he's with me and Nan-hui now.

00:09:30.174 --> 00:09:32.009
The team was launched this past March.

00:09:33.344 --> 00:09:34.512
So it was launched

00:09:34.595 --> 00:09:36.472
right after the firm's founder Oh Gyu-jang

00:09:36.555 --> 00:09:38.808
appointed Jung-in as CEO

00:09:38.891 --> 00:09:40.434
to test his successor.

00:09:43.521 --> 00:09:45.106
-What?
-Sorry?

00:09:45.189 --> 00:09:46.399
Never mind.

00:09:46.482 --> 00:09:48.275
-Thanks for the pants.
-Sure.

00:09:48.943 --> 00:09:51.445
Mr. Kang, recently…

00:09:59.036 --> 00:10:00.037
Hey.

00:10:00.746 --> 00:10:02.581
You still don't know where your office is?

00:10:02.665 --> 00:10:05.126
Well, I guess our firm is pretty big.

00:10:07.378 --> 00:10:10.005
So this was why you made Team Pro Bono.

00:10:11.507 --> 00:10:12.717
You've done your research.

00:10:13.843 --> 00:10:15.052
I was amazed, Jung-in.

00:10:15.136 --> 00:10:17.096
There actually was a reason why

00:10:17.179 --> 00:10:20.224
Korea's top law firm
launched a team that doesn't make money.

00:10:20.307 --> 00:10:23.060
"Any attorney-at-law must engage
in public interest activities

00:10:23.144 --> 00:10:25.104
for at least a certain number
of hours per year."

00:10:27.064 --> 00:10:28.816
And so, what's your point?

00:10:28.899 --> 00:10:32.528
You slipped a clause in here that says,

00:10:33.571 --> 00:10:37.283
"Hours spent on public interest activities
by pro bono attorneys

00:10:37.366 --> 00:10:40.870
will be acknowledged
as hours spent by the entire law firm."

00:10:41.996 --> 00:10:42.997
Gosh, this is like

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:46.333
a guy recruiting a team
to do his military reserve duties for him.

00:10:46.417 --> 00:10:48.335
Your cynicism hasn't changed either.

00:10:49.086 --> 00:10:51.505
Skipping public interest activities
isn't a big deal.

00:10:51.589 --> 00:10:55.843
Not if you're the top law firm
and everyone views you with bias.

00:10:55.926 --> 00:10:57.595
It's perfect fodder for criticism.

00:10:59.096 --> 00:11:00.097
Anyway,

00:11:00.181 --> 00:11:03.559
I guess you were nervous about that
and put me in that team.

00:11:03.642 --> 00:11:06.228
I mean, Oh & Partners
still has a reputation to uphold.

00:11:06.312 --> 00:11:08.564
If Team Pro Bono loses all the time,

00:11:08.647 --> 00:11:12.693
the snakes in the grass
who are eyeing your position would strike.

00:11:13.736 --> 00:11:14.737
Am I wrong?

00:11:15.529 --> 00:11:17.198
So, what's your point?

00:11:17.281 --> 00:11:19.116
-I'm busy.
-One year.

00:11:21.118 --> 00:11:22.119
One year?

00:11:25.372 --> 00:11:29.001
I'll take charge
of those pro bono losers for a year.

00:11:29.668 --> 00:11:31.795
Their win rate was only around 20%.

00:11:31.879 --> 00:11:33.797
I'll bring it up to 50%.

00:11:33.881 --> 00:11:37.801
That's pretty much a miraculous rate
for a pro bono team.

00:11:38.427 --> 00:11:39.512
This is so like you.

00:11:40.346 --> 00:11:43.682
You want to make a deal?
What do you want in return?

00:11:43.766 --> 00:11:47.811
Right. A sunny partner's office
facing southwest

00:11:47.895 --> 00:11:50.397
that gets the afternoon sun?

00:11:51.357 --> 00:11:54.109
No, it's somewhere a bit far from here.

00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:56.987
Where? Seocho-dong?

00:11:57.571 --> 00:11:58.989
Back to your old workplace?

00:11:59.073 --> 00:12:03.285
No, a bit further away.

00:12:04.036 --> 00:12:05.037
Don't tell me…

00:12:08.332 --> 00:12:11.418
You know another justice position
will open up next year.

00:12:11.502 --> 00:12:14.213
Send me there. That's my condition.

00:12:14.296 --> 00:12:17.007
-You're crazy.
-With the power Oh & Partners has,

00:12:17.091 --> 00:12:18.050
it's doable.

00:12:18.133 --> 00:12:21.470
Make me a justice candidate
nominated by the bar association.

00:12:22.555 --> 00:12:25.808
That's too much. You said it's a team
that doesn't make money.

00:12:25.891 --> 00:12:27.768
No, not money.

00:12:28.852 --> 00:12:30.854
But it might get praise.

00:12:31.647 --> 00:12:35.192
It's something Oh & Partners
has never received before.

00:12:35.276 --> 00:12:36.569
Praise from the people.

00:12:36.652 --> 00:12:39.697
Instead of being criticized
for defending only the rich and powerful,

00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:42.116
the new Oh & Partners
transforms into a firm

00:12:42.199 --> 00:12:44.868
that helps the weak
and is socially responsible.

00:12:45.953 --> 00:12:48.581
And the new leader
who spearheads this change

00:12:49.290 --> 00:12:50.708
is Oh Jung-in. Isn't that…

00:12:51.792 --> 00:12:53.794
the real reason why you made the team?

00:12:54.962 --> 00:12:56.297
That's how I see it.

00:13:03.762 --> 00:13:05.472
You may leave if you're done.

00:13:14.898 --> 00:13:15.899
Seventy.

00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:22.031
"Shady"?

00:13:22.114 --> 00:13:25.618
Geez. I said 70%.

00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:30.414
If the price for a justice position
is only a 50% win rate,

00:13:30.497 --> 00:13:31.915
wouldn't that be too cheap?

00:13:33.125 --> 00:13:34.168
If you want a deal,

00:13:34.251 --> 00:13:36.837
make it like the winning percentage
of an elite sports team.

00:13:58.275 --> 00:14:00.527
I heard the plaintiff
will appear in person today.

00:14:01.528 --> 00:14:04.657
It seems like she's convinced she'll win.
Will you be okay?

00:14:05.866 --> 00:14:07.701
No one knows who'll win in advance.

00:14:08.869 --> 00:14:09.703
Still,

00:14:10.245 --> 00:14:13.123
we'll just put our hearts into it--

00:14:14.124 --> 00:14:16.001
Now that I, Kang Da-wit, am here,

00:14:16.085 --> 00:14:17.878
I will not allow

00:14:17.961 --> 00:14:20.297
that kind of weak attitude.

00:14:22.257 --> 00:14:23.258
What are you doing?

00:14:23.342 --> 00:14:26.261
-That's my desk.
-If you can't understand it, memorize it.

00:14:26.345 --> 00:14:28.847
We will win no matter what.

00:14:28.931 --> 00:14:30.182
I will make it so.

00:14:38.941 --> 00:14:40.401
SEOUL BUKBU POLICE STATION

00:14:40.484 --> 00:14:42.987
We don't even know why
we were called here.

00:14:43.070 --> 00:14:45.614
-Well, they sued…
-Ji So-yeon.

00:14:46.991 --> 00:14:48.075
Where are you?

00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:50.494
Me?

00:14:52.121 --> 00:14:53.914
Oh, my gosh! What are you doing?

00:14:53.998 --> 00:14:56.083
-What's wrong with you?
-You damn thief.

00:14:56.166 --> 00:14:59.712
How could a beggar like you
go after my precious dog?

00:15:00.337 --> 00:15:01.588
Hey!

00:15:01.672 --> 00:15:03.549
Do you know how much Chloe is worth?

00:15:04.341 --> 00:15:05.676
You little…

00:15:05.759 --> 00:15:08.095
Ma'am, please calm down.

00:15:08.178 --> 00:15:09.179
Let go.

00:15:11.015 --> 00:15:13.642
Isn't your dog cafe just a cover

00:15:13.726 --> 00:15:16.103
to steal dogs and make money?

00:15:16.186 --> 00:15:18.981
-What?
-You're crossing the line.

00:15:19.857 --> 00:15:20.858
Have a seat.

00:15:22.901 --> 00:15:24.611
And who are you?

00:15:24.695 --> 00:15:26.530
I'm their attorney.

00:15:26.613 --> 00:15:30.075
And I could represent them if they sue
for the assault that just happened.

00:15:30.659 --> 00:15:32.494
What on earth are you talking about?

00:15:32.578 --> 00:15:34.329
Are you threatening me?

00:15:34.955 --> 00:15:36.040
Do you know who I am?

00:15:36.123 --> 00:15:39.376
You can reflect about your self-identity
all you want at home.

00:15:40.044 --> 00:15:41.670
Did you know you can be penalized

00:15:41.754 --> 00:15:43.881
for making a false accusation
without evidence?

00:15:44.465 --> 00:15:45.466
What?

00:15:46.258 --> 00:15:48.969
Are you a judge?
Why are you so arrogant?

00:15:49.970 --> 00:15:51.555
You have a keen eye though.

00:15:51.638 --> 00:15:54.266
Hold on. Instead of provoking her--

00:15:54.349 --> 00:15:58.896
My clients adopted a stray dog
that was abandoned without a collar.

00:15:58.979 --> 00:16:02.733
If she were that precious,
why appear now after not looking

00:16:02.816 --> 00:16:04.318
for a year and a half?

00:16:04.985 --> 00:16:08.322
How would you know
if I looked for her or not?

00:16:08.405 --> 00:16:12.284
If the real owner appears,
they should hand her over!

00:16:13.285 --> 00:16:14.578
-Oh, my goodness.
-In the end,

00:16:14.661 --> 00:16:16.371
the prosecution will either drop the case

00:16:16.455 --> 00:16:18.665
or tell you to settle
and drop the charges.

00:16:18.749 --> 00:16:21.460
Don't get yourself investigated
for a false accusation.

00:16:22.294 --> 00:16:23.128
Hello, ma'am.

00:16:25.255 --> 00:16:26.799
The prosecution?

00:16:27.674 --> 00:16:29.093
I'm glad you mentioned that.

00:16:29.635 --> 00:16:32.679
How about you get
a taste of Korean prosecution?

00:16:32.763 --> 00:16:35.307
-What?
-It's been a while, Judge Kang.

00:16:39.645 --> 00:16:40.687
Woo Myeong-hun?

00:16:40.771 --> 00:16:44.274
Sorry. You're no longer a judge, are you?

00:16:45.317 --> 00:16:47.528
I heard you're a pro bono attorney now.

00:16:48.070 --> 00:16:49.822
Did something happen?

00:16:51.323 --> 00:16:53.534
A former Central Investigation
Department prosecutor

00:16:53.617 --> 00:16:56.745
from the Supreme Prosecutors' Office
on a small case like this?

00:16:56.829 --> 00:16:58.831
A small case?

00:16:58.914 --> 00:17:03.627
Stealing a dog is like
kidnapping someone's child.

00:17:05.087 --> 00:17:06.880
Can't you get with the times?

00:17:07.589 --> 00:17:08.632
That's not like you.

00:17:18.433 --> 00:17:19.268
Are you okay?

00:17:21.145 --> 00:17:22.938
Is there a reason to be not okay?

00:17:24.064 --> 00:17:27.151
By the way, is the plaintiff a daughter
of a high-ranking prosecutor?

00:17:27.234 --> 00:17:30.821
Yes. She's the daughter of Assemblyman
and former Chief Prosecutor Lee Du-cheol.

00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:34.366
No wonder.

00:17:35.367 --> 00:17:36.827
That's why Myeong-hun was there.

00:17:36.910 --> 00:17:37.828
Do you know him?

00:17:38.495 --> 00:17:41.790
We trained at the JRTI together.
But we're not that close.

00:17:42.791 --> 00:17:46.253
If Myeong-hun's on the case,
it won't end easily.

00:17:46.837 --> 00:17:50.215
What? But they followed
all the proper legal procedures.

00:17:50.966 --> 00:17:52.718
Do you know what Myeong-hun's good at?

00:17:52.801 --> 00:17:53.635
What?

00:17:54.970 --> 00:17:56.180
-Planting evidence.
-What?

00:17:56.763 --> 00:17:58.307
Hey!

00:18:00.976 --> 00:18:02.603
He paints a picture first

00:18:02.686 --> 00:18:05.647
and then comes up
with evidence that matches it.

00:18:05.731 --> 00:18:08.275
Thanks to that,
he was on the fast track to success

00:18:08.358 --> 00:18:10.944
until he fell off
after I knocked him down a peg.

00:18:11.028 --> 00:18:11.987
Wait.

00:18:12.529 --> 00:18:15.574
Are you telling me
he even holds a grudge against you?

00:18:16.658 --> 00:18:18.994
Are you sure we can win this case?

00:18:20.996 --> 00:18:21.997
This is perfect.

00:18:23.415 --> 00:18:24.750
What's perfect about this?

00:18:24.833 --> 00:18:27.377
For my first case as an attorney,

00:18:27.461 --> 00:18:29.296
I thought it was too weak.

00:18:29.379 --> 00:18:31.173
You need a former SPO's prosecutor

00:18:31.256 --> 00:18:33.508
and the daughter of an assemblyman

00:18:33.592 --> 00:18:35.010
to make things look nice.

00:18:36.929 --> 00:18:37.971
This is good.

00:18:40.098 --> 00:18:41.975
-Excuse me, Mr. Kang.
-What is it?

00:18:42.059 --> 00:18:44.811
What looks so nice about this?

00:18:44.895 --> 00:18:46.230
Look forward. It's a red light.

00:18:53.237 --> 00:18:55.530
SEOUL NORTHERN DISTRICT COURT
CRIMINAL COURT

00:18:55.614 --> 00:18:56.865
What?

00:18:58.784 --> 00:19:02.204
It's just a small case,
but there are two prosecutors here.

00:19:02.287 --> 00:19:04.790
Because it involves the daughter
of a former chief prosecutor

00:19:04.873 --> 00:19:07.501
who's a big shot of the Legislation
and Judiciary Committee.

00:19:08.126 --> 00:19:10.837
But why is the judge late?
Did something happen?

00:19:10.921 --> 00:19:13.173
Judge Oh Jae-seop of Criminal Division 1

00:19:13.257 --> 00:19:15.092
is known for always being
five minutes late.

00:19:15.842 --> 00:19:17.135
He'll be here in a minute.

00:19:20.722 --> 00:19:21.556
Ms. Park.

00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:23.141
-Yes?
-Why are you so nervous?

00:19:23.225 --> 00:19:25.769
Don't tell me
it's your first time in the court.

00:19:27.312 --> 00:19:29.064
It's not my first time,

00:19:29.147 --> 00:19:31.483
but I've mainly done
just business consulting,

00:19:31.566 --> 00:19:34.152
so this is my second time
in criminal court.

00:19:34.236 --> 00:19:37.281
But you've seen many courtroom movies.
You're a film nerd.

00:19:37.990 --> 00:19:40.492
Of course! I love Philadelphia.

00:19:40.575 --> 00:19:43.078
-A Few Good Men is my all-time favorite.
-Never mind that.

00:19:43.161 --> 00:19:45.289
Just do as they do in those films.

00:19:45.372 --> 00:19:46.498
Be confident.

00:19:46.581 --> 00:19:47.916
Don't be afraid. Be bold.

00:19:51.545 --> 00:19:52.546
Okay.

00:19:54.047 --> 00:19:56.508
Three, two, one.

00:19:57.175 --> 00:19:59.303
All rise.

00:20:05.517 --> 00:20:06.977
You may be seated.

00:20:16.278 --> 00:20:18.447
Is all this even necessary for this case?

00:20:19.656 --> 00:20:21.241
-Attorney Kang.
-Yes?

00:20:21.325 --> 00:20:23.452
Let's settle the issue
amicably on both sides.

00:20:23.535 --> 00:20:24.703
Give the dog back.

00:20:25.370 --> 00:20:27.122
And have the plaintiff drop the charge.

00:20:27.205 --> 00:20:28.165
Can't we do that?

00:20:28.957 --> 00:20:30.250
Why make such a fuss about--

00:20:31.084 --> 00:20:32.085
Your Honor!

00:20:36.131 --> 00:20:37.716
For a year and a half,

00:20:37.799 --> 00:20:40.510
the defendants have already raised
the dog involved in this case,

00:20:40.594 --> 00:20:41.720
Byeol, with love--

00:20:41.803 --> 00:20:42.804
Chloe!

00:20:43.430 --> 00:20:46.058
-What a tacky name!
-Please remain silent!

00:20:46.975 --> 00:20:50.437
They've gone through
the proper procedures to adopt the dog.

00:20:51.021 --> 00:20:53.982
Simply saying to give Byeol back

00:20:54.066 --> 00:20:56.360
shows prejudgment before the trial

00:20:56.443 --> 00:20:57.569
-has even begun--
-Counsel.

00:20:58.737 --> 00:21:01.073
I think you've seen
too many Hollywood movies.

00:21:02.366 --> 00:21:03.909
-Sorry?
-This is Korea.

00:21:03.992 --> 00:21:06.203
Please stop walking around.
It's distracting.

00:21:06.286 --> 00:21:09.206
Go and speak at your table.
And get straight to the point.

00:21:10.415 --> 00:21:11.583
Yes, Your Honor.

00:21:14.419 --> 00:21:15.545
My apologies.

00:21:18.882 --> 00:21:20.592
I thought it was okay.

00:21:26.098 --> 00:21:26.973
Your Honor,

00:21:27.599 --> 00:21:30.227
we have recently attained a credible tip.

00:21:30.310 --> 00:21:32.521
For its submission,
we request a motion to reschedule--

00:21:32.604 --> 00:21:34.689
It happened a year and…

00:21:35.690 --> 00:21:37.401
a half ago.

00:21:37.484 --> 00:21:39.319
How could they attain a tip just now?

00:21:39.403 --> 00:21:40.946
Sit down!

00:21:43.532 --> 00:21:44.658
That was good too.

00:21:46.618 --> 00:21:50.163
Are you saying the Prosecutors of Korea
are fabricating evidence?

00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:53.375
Prosecution, you may proceed with that.

00:21:55.085 --> 00:21:56.711
Okay, the next hearing date will be--

00:21:56.795 --> 00:21:58.004
Your Honor.

00:22:00.215 --> 00:22:01.049
What is it?

00:22:02.717 --> 00:22:04.136
I'm sorry,

00:22:04.219 --> 00:22:06.972
but we have retained
an additional counsel.

00:22:07.055 --> 00:22:08.557
He was late due to traffic.

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:10.434
Could you please allow him to appear?

00:22:13.395 --> 00:22:15.939
Do pro bono attorneys nowadays
come late to trials?

00:22:16.565 --> 00:22:17.399
My apologies.

00:22:17.482 --> 00:22:19.568
-I won't allow it.
-Goodness.

00:22:19.651 --> 00:22:21.820
My word.

00:22:26.533 --> 00:22:28.618
Goodness.

00:22:29.327 --> 00:22:30.495
I'm sorry I'm late.

00:22:31.037 --> 00:22:34.833
Your additional counsel was Mr. Park.

00:22:37.252 --> 00:22:40.505
What's happening? Who's that old man
and why is the judge intimidated by him?

00:22:40.589 --> 00:22:42.757
That's what happened, Your Honor.

00:22:42.841 --> 00:22:45.343
Geez, for an abandoned dog case,

00:22:45.427 --> 00:22:47.929
first, it was an ex-SPO prosecutor
getting involved,

00:22:48.013 --> 00:22:49.639
and now, it's a ex-chief of this court.

00:22:50.348 --> 00:22:51.349
Well…

00:22:52.225 --> 00:22:54.561
I'm sorry, Your Honor,

00:22:54.644 --> 00:22:57.939
but since I was appointed recently…

00:22:58.023 --> 00:22:59.191
Of course.

00:22:59.274 --> 00:23:02.652
You didn't have the chance
to review the additional documents.

00:23:02.736 --> 00:23:04.946
-I'll give you some time.
-Thank you, Your Honor.

00:23:06.823 --> 00:23:09.075
Is this what people call
the power of a former judge?

00:23:10.744 --> 00:23:11.745
Thank you, Your Honor.

00:23:22.505 --> 00:23:25.050
If that's the card they're playing,

00:23:26.176 --> 00:23:27.719
let's use an ex-judge as an attorney.

00:23:28.386 --> 00:23:30.472
Sir? Isn't that you?

00:23:31.139 --> 00:23:33.808
-No?
-I'm from Seoul Central District Court.

00:23:33.892 --> 00:23:35.810
There are others more directly related.

00:23:36.519 --> 00:23:37.354
Leave it to me.

00:23:37.437 --> 00:23:40.273
You're using privileges former judges get
for a pro bono case?

00:23:40.357 --> 00:23:41.191
Why not?

00:23:41.274 --> 00:23:44.361
It's an institutional corruption
that should be gotten rid of.

00:23:44.444 --> 00:23:45.904
You can't use that for pro bono--

00:23:45.987 --> 00:23:48.156
Can't common folks
get some benefit from it?

00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:50.325
Everyone who's rich
and powerful uses it.

00:23:50.408 --> 00:23:52.744
-Still--
-In a public interest case,

00:23:52.827 --> 00:23:54.579
defense is provided free of cost.

00:23:54.663 --> 00:23:57.540
We can't pay such an attorney
in the first place.

00:23:58.959 --> 00:24:00.085
Leave that to me.

00:24:04.756 --> 00:24:06.675
Fore!

00:24:06.758 --> 00:24:08.718
-Good gracious.
-You really sliced that ball.

00:24:08.802 --> 00:24:09.636
Chief!

00:24:10.595 --> 00:24:12.222
Goodness, Judge Kang.

00:24:12.305 --> 00:24:13.723
What are you doing here?

00:24:13.807 --> 00:24:17.727
You wouldn't answer my calls,
so I came all the way here, Chief.

00:24:17.811 --> 00:24:18.812
Anyways,

00:24:18.895 --> 00:24:20.272
you're still slicing the ball.

00:24:20.355 --> 00:24:23.650
Relax your arms during the follow-through.

00:24:23.733 --> 00:24:27.070
Why are you doing this to me, Judge Kang?

00:24:27.153 --> 00:24:29.948
You don't need a former chief
for measly dog case!

00:24:30.031 --> 00:24:31.241
You're right.

00:24:31.324 --> 00:24:33.285
We should use such privileges

00:24:33.368 --> 00:24:36.955
for cases involving conglomerate CEOs,
like when you did as a judge.

00:24:37.539 --> 00:24:41.793
That way, the judge and those attorneys
can go play golf together, go to bars,

00:24:41.876 --> 00:24:43.712
-and go overseas to play golf again--
-Wait.

00:24:43.795 --> 00:24:46.756
What on earth
are you trying to say, Judge Kang?

00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:48.842
Don't worry! It's all in the past.

00:24:48.925 --> 00:24:50.135
It's all right.

00:24:50.218 --> 00:24:54.681
I just happen to have an excellent memory

00:24:54.764 --> 00:24:57.434
and have heard so many stories.

00:24:57.517 --> 00:24:59.519
Geez, you're unbelievable.

00:25:00.228 --> 00:25:01.271
Chief.

00:25:02.063 --> 00:25:05.483
This is a specially crafted ball
that prevents slices.

00:25:05.567 --> 00:25:07.193
-What?
-Try this one out.

00:25:07.277 --> 00:25:08.153
Is that so?

00:25:09.654 --> 00:25:11.031
Try it.

00:25:14.993 --> 00:25:16.536
You're truly amazing, sir!

00:25:16.619 --> 00:25:19.539
A former chief judge
joining a pro bono case is unheard of.

00:25:19.622 --> 00:25:20.707
And he's doing it for free.

00:25:20.790 --> 00:25:23.626
I guess the judge
will be less biased from now on.

00:25:23.710 --> 00:25:26.546
No, of his own accord,

00:25:27.505 --> 00:25:29.049
he'll recuse himself from the case.

00:25:29.632 --> 00:25:30.717
-Sorry?
-Under Article 24

00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:32.552
of the Criminal Procedure Act,

00:25:32.635 --> 00:25:35.722
I shall recuse myself sua sponte
from this case.

00:25:36.681 --> 00:25:38.058
Your Honor.

00:25:39.976 --> 00:25:41.102
Your Honor!

00:25:50.820 --> 00:25:53.531
Was it just because
they once worked at the same court?

00:25:53.615 --> 00:25:56.368
That wouldn't be enough to recuse himself.

00:25:56.451 --> 00:25:58.536
That's how Judge Oh is.

00:25:58.620 --> 00:26:00.330
A safety-first guy with a faint heart.

00:26:00.413 --> 00:26:04.000
-He didn't want to be stuck in the middle.
-What do you mean?

00:26:04.084 --> 00:26:07.629
Judge Oh went to the same high school
that Woo Myeong-hun is from.

00:26:07.712 --> 00:26:12.384
They've been taking baking class together
for two years or something as a hobby.

00:26:12.467 --> 00:26:13.843
Isn't that ridiculous?

00:26:16.763 --> 00:26:20.183
So that's why the judge
was so amicable toward the prosecution.

00:26:20.683 --> 00:26:23.561
From the start, using an ex-judge
as an attorney wasn't your goal.

00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:27.357
Pretty good, Ms. Park.

00:26:28.066 --> 00:26:30.944
Your goal was to change the judge.

00:26:32.862 --> 00:26:33.988
But…

00:26:35.115 --> 00:26:36.116
Do you know?

00:26:36.741 --> 00:26:40.412
Do you know the Criminal Division 2 judge
that the case will be reassigned to?

00:26:41.246 --> 00:26:43.164
What? What's the next judge like?

00:26:43.248 --> 00:26:44.749
Don't tell me it's the blunt one.

00:26:45.583 --> 00:26:49.963
For three straight years, he was chosen
by the bar as the unfriendliest judge.

00:26:50.046 --> 00:26:52.006
He's famous for his anger issues.

00:26:52.090 --> 00:26:55.135
So who is it?
Why am I the only one who doesn't know?

00:26:55.218 --> 00:26:56.636
Geez.

00:26:56.719 --> 00:26:58.012
Hey, you little…

00:26:58.096 --> 00:26:59.347
You punk!

00:26:59.431 --> 00:27:01.433
They should take your limbs and tear…

00:27:01.516 --> 00:27:02.809
Get lost!

00:27:02.892 --> 00:27:05.311
Goodness. Yes, I know.

00:27:06.312 --> 00:27:09.691
He wasn't promoted due to his temper
and works with those ten years his junior.

00:27:09.774 --> 00:27:12.360
It's Chief Judge Choi Ho-jip.

00:27:13.027 --> 00:27:15.071
Goodness. What do we do?
It's the blunt judge.

00:27:15.155 --> 00:27:16.322
Are you close with him?

00:27:16.406 --> 00:27:19.451
No way. I'm the type of judge

00:27:19.534 --> 00:27:20.869
he hates the most.

00:27:21.661 --> 00:27:25.248
A judge who's socially adept
and successful.

00:27:30.295 --> 00:27:31.838
I was out of strength at the end.

00:27:31.921 --> 00:27:32.797
And here's some food.

00:27:32.881 --> 00:27:35.550
-No, I want the mung bean pancakes.
-Right, the pancakes.

00:27:35.633 --> 00:27:37.969
You're too old to be picky with food!

00:27:38.052 --> 00:27:40.305
Just eat what they give you, you fool!

00:27:40.388 --> 00:27:41.347
What?

00:27:41.431 --> 00:27:42.557
Act your age.

00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:46.728
Then why did you have
the trial assigned to such a person?

00:27:47.437 --> 00:27:50.440
Rather than a judge who's outwardly nice
but biased on the inside,

00:27:50.523 --> 00:27:53.526
wouldn't a judge
who's equally blunt to everyone

00:27:54.694 --> 00:27:56.154
be more favorable for us?

00:27:59.115 --> 00:28:02.535
By the way, did the prosecution
submit the additional evidence?

00:28:02.619 --> 00:28:03.620
Just a moment, sir.

00:28:04.621 --> 00:28:05.580
Another moment?

00:28:07.499 --> 00:28:08.416
They did submit it.

00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:09.709
What is it?

00:28:09.792 --> 00:28:10.960
WITNESS STATEMENT

00:28:11.044 --> 00:28:12.462
It's a witness statement.

00:28:13.546 --> 00:28:14.881
A witness?

00:28:15.924 --> 00:28:16.925
CAFE PAWS & FLUFFS

00:28:17.592 --> 00:28:18.468
Hello, So-yeon.

00:28:18.551 --> 00:28:20.929
-Hello.
-Hello.

00:28:21.012 --> 00:28:22.138
Hello.

00:28:22.222 --> 00:28:23.681
Hey, stay away.

00:28:23.765 --> 00:28:25.350
Stay away! You've met me!

00:28:25.433 --> 00:28:27.769
-You've already met me!
-Byeol, over here.

00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:30.855
Good. Sit.

00:28:31.523 --> 00:28:33.399
-Why isn't it on a leash?
-Hello.

00:28:33.483 --> 00:28:34.651
Hello, sir.

00:28:34.734 --> 00:28:35.985
Hello.

00:28:36.986 --> 00:28:38.446
I'll prepare something to drink.

00:28:39.364 --> 00:28:41.032
It's okay, sir.

00:28:43.535 --> 00:28:45.245
You were a bit surprised, weren't you?

00:28:45.328 --> 00:28:46.704
I'll go wash my hands quickly.

00:28:46.788 --> 00:28:48.206
-So-yeon.
-Yes?

00:28:48.289 --> 00:28:50.291
Today is the day, isn't it?

00:28:52.919 --> 00:28:55.171
-Yes.
-What's today?

00:28:56.589 --> 00:28:59.050
-Well…
-So-yeon.

00:28:59.133 --> 00:29:00.635
Could you take a seat for a bit?

00:29:00.718 --> 00:29:01.553
Just me?

00:29:07.809 --> 00:29:08.810
The prosecution

00:29:09.769 --> 00:29:12.355
suddenly submitted
some additional evidence.

00:29:12.438 --> 00:29:14.357
Okay. What is it?

00:29:15.024 --> 00:29:18.862
You were clear that Byeol didn't have
a collar when you found her, right?

00:29:20.113 --> 00:29:21.114
Yes.

00:29:21.865 --> 00:29:23.741
But a witness has suddenly appeared.

00:29:25.243 --> 00:29:28.121
They said they saw you
secretly throw away Byeol's collar.

00:29:28.955 --> 00:29:29.873
What?

00:29:32.542 --> 00:29:33.835
That's nonsense.

00:29:33.918 --> 00:29:35.587
Where would I even throw it away?

00:29:37.255 --> 00:29:39.465
They saw you throw it away
in the Hangang River.

00:29:42.260 --> 00:29:43.261
Seriously.

00:29:43.970 --> 00:29:46.472
That's nonsense. It's a total lie.
Who said that?

00:29:46.556 --> 00:29:49.392
Exactly. When the plaintiff's attorney
used to be a prosecutor,

00:29:49.475 --> 00:29:51.394
he was good at manipulating evidence.

00:29:51.477 --> 00:29:53.563
I doubted it, but it was true.

00:29:53.646 --> 00:29:55.106
Is there something going on?

00:29:56.482 --> 00:29:57.942
No, ma'am.

00:29:58.026 --> 00:30:00.028
-It's nothing to worry about.
-That's not true.

00:30:01.738 --> 00:30:03.823
It is something to worry about.

00:30:03.907 --> 00:30:05.491
What are you talking about?

00:30:06.868 --> 00:30:09.537
It wasn't the Hangang River.
Where did you throw it away?

00:30:13.124 --> 00:30:14.042
Come on.

00:30:14.918 --> 00:30:16.878
What are you talking about?

00:30:16.961 --> 00:30:19.923
If it wasn't the Hangang River,
where did you throw away the collar?

00:30:21.257 --> 00:30:22.926
What kind of person do you think I am?

00:30:23.009 --> 00:30:24.427
I'm not a bad person.

00:30:24.510 --> 00:30:26.804
Whether you're a good person or not

00:30:26.888 --> 00:30:28.264
is not what I'm interested in.

00:30:28.348 --> 00:30:29.891
Just answer my question.

00:30:30.391 --> 00:30:31.517
Where did you throw it away?

00:30:33.227 --> 00:30:35.063
Where did she find the dog? Seongbukcheon?

00:30:38.232 --> 00:30:40.735
I'm right. It's Seongbukcheon Stream.

00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:44.364
-You threw it away in there?
-Mr. Kang.

00:30:44.447 --> 00:30:46.532
On what grounds
are you speaking so conclusively?

00:30:46.616 --> 00:30:48.743
You didn't do that. Right, So-yeon?

00:30:48.826 --> 00:30:50.495
You wouldn't have done that.

00:30:51.037 --> 00:30:52.121
You didn't, right?

00:30:58.211 --> 00:30:59.087
Seriously.

00:30:59.712 --> 00:31:01.089
Ma'am.

00:31:01.172 --> 00:31:04.050
-It's not that…
-Perjury or a false statement

00:31:04.133 --> 00:31:05.593
will only make it bad for her.

00:31:08.221 --> 00:31:09.097
Oh, no.

00:31:10.890 --> 00:31:11.975
Oh, my gosh.

00:31:12.058 --> 00:31:14.727
Oh, no. I'm sorry!

00:31:16.062 --> 00:31:16.896
I'm sorry.

00:31:23.486 --> 00:31:25.196
Did you really throw it away?

00:31:34.038 --> 00:31:36.082
Then, the witness statement wasn't forged.

00:31:37.125 --> 00:31:39.127
No, it was forged.

00:31:39.836 --> 00:31:41.796
Myeong-hun must have contacted
a lowly ex-convict

00:31:42.338 --> 00:31:44.549
that he retained
from his years as a prosecutor

00:31:45.174 --> 00:31:46.759
to make a statement.

00:31:46.843 --> 00:31:48.761
Just do it one more time.

00:31:48.845 --> 00:31:50.138
Sir.

00:31:50.805 --> 00:31:52.890
Please let me go now.

00:31:56.894 --> 00:31:59.355
Memorize the statement
you'll tell the prosecutor.

00:31:59.439 --> 00:32:01.691
Don't get the date wrong
like last time.

00:32:02.567 --> 00:32:04.652
Look at the photo of the dog closely too.

00:32:04.736 --> 00:32:06.946
Then, there was no witness,

00:32:08.448 --> 00:32:10.992
but So-yeon did throw the collar away.

00:32:11.075 --> 00:32:12.535
This makes me so sad.

00:32:12.618 --> 00:32:14.370
How did you find this out?

00:32:15.079 --> 00:32:16.122
The first reaction.

00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:18.041
The first reaction?

00:32:18.666 --> 00:32:21.669
When one is suddenly asked
about the thing they want to hide,

00:32:21.753 --> 00:32:25.465
they react defensively first
like a conditioned response.

00:32:26.132 --> 00:32:27.175
"Where?"

00:32:27.258 --> 00:32:29.886
That's nonsense.
Where would I even throw it away?

00:32:29.969 --> 00:32:31.721
If it never happened,

00:32:31.804 --> 00:32:34.265
she would've denied it
without any unnecessary comments.

00:32:34.348 --> 00:32:37.685
"I'm not a bad person."
"Who do you think I am?" Blah, blah.

00:32:37.769 --> 00:32:41.272
Making such unnecessary comments

00:32:42.732 --> 00:32:46.277
is derived from the instinctive
defensive mechanism of humans.

00:32:48.029 --> 00:32:49.155
Yes, you're right.

00:32:49.781 --> 00:32:51.866
When she asked
about where it was thrown away

00:32:52.533 --> 00:32:54.619
and heard it was the Hangang River,

00:32:56.204 --> 00:32:59.665
her face lit up momentarily.

00:32:59.749 --> 00:33:01.709
They saw you throw it away
in the Hangang River.

00:33:03.336 --> 00:33:04.879
Seriously.

00:33:04.962 --> 00:33:07.632
That's nonsense. It's a total lie.
Who said that?

00:33:07.715 --> 00:33:09.217
-Mr. Kang.
-Yes?

00:33:09.300 --> 00:33:10.635
You truly are amazing.

00:33:11.594 --> 00:33:12.428
Seriously.

00:33:13.221 --> 00:33:16.516
When you wear the gown
and sit at the bench long enough,

00:33:17.100 --> 00:33:18.184
you come to see everything.

00:33:26.192 --> 00:33:27.610
Now, please tell us.

00:33:27.693 --> 00:33:29.403
Why did you lie?

00:33:32.115 --> 00:33:33.491
That collar.

00:33:37.745 --> 00:33:39.247
It was because of that collar.

00:33:40.414 --> 00:33:42.291
What? The collar?

00:33:49.257 --> 00:33:50.424
Hi.

00:33:58.683 --> 00:33:59.684
Hi.

00:34:01.853 --> 00:34:02.687
Hey.

00:34:03.187 --> 00:34:06.566
Hi. Hi there.

00:34:06.649 --> 00:34:09.235
What are you doing here all by yourself?

00:34:09.944 --> 00:34:13.739
You must've been scared,
but you didn't even bark.

00:34:13.823 --> 00:34:14.824
Right?

00:34:17.118 --> 00:34:18.119
Don't worry.

00:34:19.036 --> 00:34:20.538
I'll find your home.

00:34:22.707 --> 00:34:23.791
What's this?

00:34:24.834 --> 00:34:26.752
What's this here?

00:34:28.004 --> 00:34:29.130
CHLOE

00:34:30.590 --> 00:34:32.800
An anti-bark collar?

00:34:32.884 --> 00:34:35.386
Yes. Whenever a dog barks,

00:34:36.220 --> 00:34:37.805
it gives an electric shock.

00:34:40.141 --> 00:34:42.977
Unbelievable.
How can you use that on your pet dog?

00:34:43.060 --> 00:34:46.230
It's not illegal in Korea.

00:34:47.148 --> 00:34:49.400
Still, you can't take
someone else's dog like that.

00:34:50.067 --> 00:34:52.153
Voltage for a pet item
wouldn't be that high.

00:34:57.700 --> 00:34:58.701
What?

00:34:59.535 --> 00:35:01.871
Do you want to try it yourself?

00:35:03.497 --> 00:35:04.332
Try what?

00:35:04.415 --> 00:35:07.752
There's a sample our group bought.

00:35:07.835 --> 00:35:09.170
Wait just a moment.

00:35:12.798 --> 00:35:13.966
Well, she didn't have to…

00:35:14.717 --> 00:35:16.093
Come on.

00:35:16.761 --> 00:35:18.888
It looks like a children's toy.

00:35:18.971 --> 00:35:20.848
So you want me to try this on?

00:35:20.932 --> 00:35:21.933
Yes.

00:35:23.184 --> 00:35:24.352
See for yourself.

00:35:29.065 --> 00:35:31.275
Well, why not?

00:35:32.068 --> 00:35:33.486
Do I wear it like this?

00:35:35.613 --> 00:35:37.365
It is a bit uncomfortable.

00:35:38.032 --> 00:35:39.283
Now what?

00:35:39.867 --> 00:35:41.202
Do I need to bark?

00:35:50.086 --> 00:35:51.337
Hold on, sir!

00:35:53.547 --> 00:35:54.548
Here.

00:35:55.216 --> 00:35:59.762
They put things like that
around dogs' necks?

00:35:59.845 --> 00:36:00.721
So,

00:36:01.722 --> 00:36:04.350
is that why you didn't bark?

00:36:05.351 --> 00:36:06.227
Poor Byeol.

00:36:07.311 --> 00:36:08.312
Honey.

00:36:08.896 --> 00:36:12.441
The one Byeol was wearing
had a higher voltage,

00:36:12.525 --> 00:36:13.943
so it's banned from being imported.

00:36:14.026 --> 00:36:15.611
And top of that,

00:36:15.695 --> 00:36:19.573
they deliberately unlocked
the limit on the highest voltage level.

00:36:22.827 --> 00:36:24.537
Those horrible people!

00:36:24.620 --> 00:36:27.456
You found evidence of abuse.

00:36:29.375 --> 00:36:30.918
Why didn't you report it right away?

00:36:31.002 --> 00:36:32.044
Report?

00:36:35.047 --> 00:36:36.590
What's the point?

00:36:36.674 --> 00:36:38.050
What do you mean?

00:36:38.134 --> 00:36:40.678
You have to report it
so it's investigated as animal abuse.

00:36:42.263 --> 00:36:44.390
I understand why you didn't report it.

00:36:45.683 --> 00:36:49.061
Even if you report it,
you'd have to send her back to the abuser.

00:36:49.645 --> 00:36:53.024
According to the law,
a dog is still the owner's property.

00:36:54.025 --> 00:36:55.151
Was that the reason?

00:36:56.152 --> 00:36:57.153
Yes.

00:36:58.362 --> 00:37:04.035
I really didn't want
to send Byeol back to such people.

00:37:04.118 --> 00:37:05.911
That's why I threw…

00:37:12.043 --> 00:37:13.961
I'm sorry, ma'am.

00:37:14.628 --> 00:37:16.547
You were having such a hard time then

00:37:17.381 --> 00:37:19.759
and I asked you to adopt her.

00:37:21.218 --> 00:37:22.553
It's all my fault.

00:37:22.636 --> 00:37:24.180
Of course, it's your fault.

00:37:24.263 --> 00:37:27.600
No matter how much you explain,
they're just motives for the crime.

00:37:28.517 --> 00:37:31.562
You took her when you clearly knew
she had a guardian.

00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:34.273
That's a crime.

00:37:35.066 --> 00:37:38.569
I see. So that's what happened.

00:37:48.871 --> 00:37:51.999
Would you like to stick around today?

00:37:52.833 --> 00:37:53.959
Today is

00:37:54.627 --> 00:37:56.754
the day I feed Byeol a nice, big meal.

00:37:57.880 --> 00:37:59.548
Let's feed Byeol

00:38:00.716 --> 00:38:02.718
and share the food together.

00:38:02.802 --> 00:38:03.803
What…

00:38:05.763 --> 00:38:07.098
What food are we sharing?

00:38:10.893 --> 00:38:12.019
Okay, let's sit.

00:38:33.416 --> 00:38:34.750
My Han-byeol.

00:38:36.127 --> 00:38:38.170
Happy birthday.

00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:44.927
I said no!

00:38:45.010 --> 00:38:47.888
Seriously, it'll be fine.

00:38:47.972 --> 00:38:50.182
I'm going with my friends.

00:38:50.266 --> 00:38:51.976
Don't worry about it.

00:38:52.059 --> 00:38:53.310
No!

00:38:53.394 --> 00:38:55.229
There will be so many people.

00:38:55.312 --> 00:38:57.898
What if you get hurt by any chance?

00:38:59.942 --> 00:39:01.318
Grandma!

00:39:01.402 --> 00:39:03.446
Will you talk to him, please?

00:39:03.529 --> 00:39:07.116
I really want to go
to the street festival.

00:39:08.242 --> 00:39:10.244
I'm sure things will be fine.

00:39:10.327 --> 00:39:12.746
She's going with a bunch of her friends.

00:39:12.830 --> 00:39:14.039
Aren't you worried at all?

00:39:14.123 --> 00:39:15.916
Don't you remember her parents?

00:39:16.667 --> 00:39:19.545
Why would you bring that up now?

00:39:19.628 --> 00:39:20.588
Grandma.

00:39:21.755 --> 00:39:22.756
I'm sorry.

00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:24.216
They left Han-byeol here

00:39:24.300 --> 00:39:27.219
and just had go on a trip
during that crowded vacation season.

00:39:27.303 --> 00:39:29.388
They had the accident
while driving in the rain.

00:39:29.472 --> 00:39:31.724
You call me foolish, but I can't help it.

00:39:33.309 --> 00:39:34.852
Grandpa, I'll be really careful.

00:39:34.935 --> 00:39:36.312
Okay? I promise.

00:39:36.395 --> 00:39:38.355
Honey, come on!

00:39:39.148 --> 00:39:41.525
What could possibly go wrong?

00:39:42.234 --> 00:39:43.611
I'd like to go there too.

00:39:43.694 --> 00:39:45.613
Should I put on a uniform and join you?

00:39:46.238 --> 00:39:48.741
That'll be awesome! I'll lend you mine.

00:39:49.408 --> 00:39:51.869
Gosh, our beautiful Byeol.

00:39:52.536 --> 00:39:55.623
You look so pretty today.
Should we take a photo?

00:39:55.706 --> 00:39:56.957
Okay.

00:39:59.376 --> 00:40:01.045
One, two, three.

00:40:04.548 --> 00:40:05.799
Han-byeol.

00:40:11.013 --> 00:40:13.349
My beautiful child.

00:40:19.104 --> 00:40:20.314
Byeol.

00:40:20.397 --> 00:40:21.899
BAEK HAN-BYEOL

00:40:21.982 --> 00:40:24.443
A STAR IN THE SKY
OCTOBER 29, 2022

00:40:31.492 --> 00:40:32.826
Ma'am, please.

00:40:33.536 --> 00:40:36.789
If I don't find a new guardian in a week,

00:40:38.082 --> 00:40:39.750
they'll put her to sleep.

00:40:39.833 --> 00:40:43.003
But my place doesn't allow pets.

00:40:43.921 --> 00:40:45.297
So isn't there any way?

00:40:47.383 --> 00:40:48.926
I don't want to form

00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:52.346
any kind of relationship again.

00:40:54.473 --> 00:40:56.725
I'm going to close this cafe soon too.

00:40:57.726 --> 00:41:00.104
Honestly, I don't have
the will to live anymore.

00:41:00.980 --> 00:41:02.273
So,

00:41:03.983 --> 00:41:06.485
-just take her back.
-Ma'am, just one night!

00:41:08.070 --> 00:41:09.613
Can't you let her stay here

00:41:10.239 --> 00:41:11.991
just for tonight?

00:41:12.074 --> 00:41:13.450
I have the night shift.

00:41:13.534 --> 00:41:16.620
I'll make sure
to pick her up tomorrow. Okay?

00:41:41.186 --> 00:41:42.187
Grandma.

00:41:43.230 --> 00:41:44.231
Grandma.

00:41:51.196 --> 00:41:52.197
Grandma.

00:42:19.642 --> 00:42:20.643
Han-byeol.

00:42:22.311 --> 00:42:25.314
Han-byeol, my beautiful child.

00:42:25.397 --> 00:42:26.857
My little puppy.

00:42:31.945 --> 00:42:33.405
Stop crying, Grandma.

00:42:34.573 --> 00:42:36.533
I'm in a really good place now,

00:42:36.617 --> 00:42:38.118
living happily every day.

00:42:39.495 --> 00:42:41.747
So stop crying, Grandma.

00:42:42.498 --> 00:42:43.374
Okay?

00:42:43.999 --> 00:42:44.875
Don't you ever

00:42:45.501 --> 00:42:47.336
think of those terrible thoughts.

00:42:48.712 --> 00:42:51.590
You have to live a long life
before you come to me. Okay?

00:42:57.304 --> 00:42:58.305
Han-byeol.

00:43:04.019 --> 00:43:05.646
I pray out of gratitude every day.

00:43:06.689 --> 00:43:10.192
I'm so glad
you didn't come with me that day.

00:43:12.569 --> 00:43:14.029
That was a close one.

00:43:14.780 --> 00:43:16.365
What a relief, right?

00:43:19.827 --> 00:43:20.911
Byeol.

00:43:24.748 --> 00:43:26.542
Byeol.

00:43:29.545 --> 00:43:31.338
Byeol.

00:43:46.228 --> 00:43:47.855
Byeol.

00:43:55.362 --> 00:43:56.947
Isn't there any way?

00:43:58.449 --> 00:43:59.950
They'll be punished,

00:44:00.617 --> 00:44:02.870
and Byeol will have to
go back to those abusers.

00:44:04.121 --> 00:44:06.165
How can the law be like this?

00:44:07.291 --> 00:44:09.626
The provisions of the law
are always beautiful,

00:44:10.502 --> 00:44:12.296
but the reality is the gutter.

00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:16.133
You all know that very well.

00:44:18.218 --> 00:44:19.052
Let's go.

00:44:21.722 --> 00:44:22.723
I don't know.

00:44:28.353 --> 00:44:31.023
In this gutter-like reality,
I still don't know

00:44:31.732 --> 00:44:32.858
how to win.

00:44:34.485 --> 00:44:36.445
You could teach me since I don't know.

00:44:37.529 --> 00:44:38.822
You could give me a chance.

00:44:39.698 --> 00:44:40.532
Wait.

00:44:41.325 --> 00:44:42.743
I'll do anything too.

00:44:42.826 --> 00:44:45.954
I'm not as talented
as Gi-ppeum in legal matters

00:44:46.038 --> 00:44:47.748
or multi-talented like Yeong-sil,

00:44:48.373 --> 00:44:50.501
but I'm really good at doing legwork.

00:44:53.378 --> 00:44:54.546
What's with those faces?

00:44:55.255 --> 00:44:58.842
Did you think I, Kang Da-wit,
was going to lose

00:44:58.926 --> 00:45:00.552
his first case as an attorney?

00:45:01.386 --> 00:45:04.223
Right?
You must have a way to win, don't you?

00:45:04.306 --> 00:45:05.182
Mr. Kang!

00:45:06.683 --> 00:45:08.101
Since we're here at Seongbukcheon,

00:45:09.269 --> 00:45:11.396
let's eat outside. It's on me.

00:45:11.480 --> 00:45:13.357
Okay. Sure!

00:45:13.982 --> 00:45:15.943
By the way, Ms. Park.

00:45:16.026 --> 00:45:19.571
I think I've heard that line
in a drama before.

00:45:19.655 --> 00:45:21.240
-What line?
-"You could teach me

00:45:21.323 --> 00:45:22.908
since I don't know."

00:45:22.991 --> 00:45:26.245
"You could give me a chance."
I think I've heard this before.

00:45:26.828 --> 00:45:29.164
You must be imagining things.

00:45:29.831 --> 00:45:31.250
Let's hurry.

00:45:31.333 --> 00:45:33.043
-What am I imagining?
-Let's go.

00:45:33.126 --> 00:45:35.462
-Hurry.
-Have you heard it before too, Mr. Hwang?

00:45:35.546 --> 00:45:36.672
What do you mean?

00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:40.801
Counsel.

00:45:41.385 --> 00:45:43.595
-Yes, Your Honor?
-You submitted the document?

00:45:44.471 --> 00:45:46.974
You admit to throwing the collar away,

00:45:47.057 --> 00:45:48.392
so you're pleading guilty?

00:45:49.601 --> 00:45:50.894
No, Your Honor.

00:45:50.978 --> 00:45:54.523
Then, what is it? What do you want to do?

00:45:54.606 --> 00:45:55.816
Is there something else to do?

00:45:55.899 --> 00:45:56.775
Your Honor,

00:45:57.651 --> 00:45:59.861
please end this trial early--

00:45:59.945 --> 00:46:02.948
We request a jury trial.

00:46:08.328 --> 00:46:09.621
What?

00:46:09.705 --> 00:46:11.665
We plead not guilty

00:46:11.748 --> 00:46:14.835
and hope for a jury trial
so our defendants

00:46:14.918 --> 00:46:17.170
may receive a fair trial.

00:46:19.298 --> 00:46:20.299
"A fair trial"?

00:46:20.966 --> 00:46:25.887
Are you saying that you don't trust
a trial I preside over will be fair?

00:46:25.971 --> 00:46:29.099
Your Honor, asking for a jury trial
for a case like this

00:46:29.182 --> 00:46:30.851
is a typical trick to delay a trial.

00:46:30.934 --> 00:46:32.144
Don't fall for this--

00:46:32.227 --> 00:46:33.186
Be quiet!

00:46:33.895 --> 00:46:35.731
-Sorry?
-I'm the one who decides

00:46:35.814 --> 00:46:37.232
how the trial will proceed.

00:46:37.316 --> 00:46:38.900
Don't tell me what to do.

00:46:39.443 --> 00:46:40.611
But Your Honor,

00:46:40.694 --> 00:46:42.779
we have the right to state our view--

00:46:42.863 --> 00:46:44.781
You be a judge, then!

00:46:46.283 --> 00:46:47.284
Be a judge.

00:46:50.329 --> 00:46:51.997
Okay, all right.

00:46:52.080 --> 00:46:53.540
Let's do that.

00:46:53.624 --> 00:46:56.168
If you want that so badly…

00:46:56.251 --> 00:46:59.087
All right. A jury trial?

00:46:59.171 --> 00:47:01.131
Yeah? And a fair trial?

00:47:01.214 --> 00:47:03.216
Sure. Let's do that.

00:47:03.300 --> 00:47:04.968
Let's take this as far as we can.

00:47:07.721 --> 00:47:09.222
Thank you, Your Honor.

00:47:14.061 --> 00:47:15.979
What trick is he pulling now?

00:47:17.648 --> 00:47:21.026
Okay! Let's prepare
our weapon for battle now.

00:47:21.109 --> 00:47:23.195
Ms. Park will prepare the legal argument.

00:47:23.278 --> 00:47:24.363
-Okay.
-Mr. Jang.

00:47:26.114 --> 00:47:27.240
Continue what you're doing.

00:47:28.075 --> 00:47:29.451
-Mr. Hwang.
-I'll do anything, sir.

00:47:29.534 --> 00:47:30.952
Should I search for precedents?

00:47:31.036 --> 00:47:33.497
You said you're good
with legwork, right? Here.

00:47:34.373 --> 00:47:35.666
-Ms. Yoo.
-Yes?

00:47:35.749 --> 00:47:37.834
Though it's not your case,
you said you'd help?

00:47:37.918 --> 00:47:39.044
I did.

00:47:39.127 --> 00:47:42.005
Don't you often hear
that you look young or like a baby?

00:47:42.089 --> 00:47:43.090
Hold on.

00:47:43.173 --> 00:47:46.093
Commenting on your colleague's looks
can be sexual harassment--

00:47:46.176 --> 00:47:48.762
-Are you up for an undercover job?
-Undercover?

00:47:48.845 --> 00:47:51.890
Not you, film nerd.
I was talking to this one with IED.

00:47:51.973 --> 00:47:53.975
IED? Intermittent explosive disorder?

00:47:54.643 --> 00:47:57.229
That term fosters prejudice
against disabilities…

00:47:59.272 --> 00:48:00.816
Hello, ma'am.

00:48:00.899 --> 00:48:01.733
Hi.

00:48:01.817 --> 00:48:03.402
-Are you So-mi?
-Yes.

00:48:03.485 --> 00:48:04.736
Come on in.

00:48:06.863 --> 00:48:10.117
I heard you were really good
at teaching the recorder.

00:48:10.200 --> 00:48:13.245
A-reum's test is in a week,
so I'm worried.

00:48:13.328 --> 00:48:15.414
You must have faith in me, ma'am.

00:48:15.497 --> 00:48:17.332
Playing the recorder
is all about breathing.

00:48:17.416 --> 00:48:19.960
I'll start with teaching her
a new way to breathe.

00:48:24.840 --> 00:48:26.383
Okay. I'll put my faith in you.

00:48:27.634 --> 00:48:30.095
But are you really a high school student?

00:48:32.264 --> 00:48:33.765
Why?

00:48:33.849 --> 00:48:36.143
Do I not look like one?

00:48:36.226 --> 00:48:39.187
I'm so sad. Crying face.

00:48:39.271 --> 00:48:42.941
All right. But something about you
seems older…

00:48:43.024 --> 00:48:44.568
I have an old face.

00:48:45.610 --> 00:48:46.611
I see.

00:48:49.906 --> 00:48:52.534
What am I doing right now?

00:48:53.785 --> 00:48:54.995
-Where is it?
-Mom.

00:48:56.288 --> 00:48:57.289
What is that man doing?

00:48:59.082 --> 00:49:01.251
Let's not look.
And don't make eye contact.

00:49:02.377 --> 00:49:03.378
My back!

00:49:05.005 --> 00:49:06.214
Still,

00:49:07.174 --> 00:49:08.675
isn't this too much legwork?

00:49:14.514 --> 00:49:16.391
-Mr. Kang.
-Yes?

00:49:16.475 --> 00:49:20.395
The Pomeranian abuse case
at Pyeongtaek Station 15 years ago…

00:49:20.479 --> 00:49:21.563
Do you have the precedent?

00:49:23.440 --> 00:49:25.275
-I printed it out.
-Thank you.

00:49:32.157 --> 00:49:36.077
OH & PARTNERS
ATTORNEY YOO NAN-HUI

00:49:38.163 --> 00:49:39.164
LEE DU-CHEOL

00:49:51.927 --> 00:49:53.845
Got you!

00:49:53.929 --> 00:49:55.972
Ma'am!

00:49:56.056 --> 00:49:58.683
-Do you know how much that cost?
-Got you!

00:49:58.767 --> 00:50:00.685
It's expensive!
How are you going to pay for it?

00:50:00.769 --> 00:50:03.688
There's a snake there!

00:50:05.023 --> 00:50:07.692
This is a toy snake!

00:50:10.445 --> 00:50:11.404
I see.

00:50:11.488 --> 00:50:13.657
I'm sorry, ma'am.

00:50:14.574 --> 00:50:15.867
This isn't even the first time.

00:50:16.743 --> 00:50:17.744
Ma'am,

00:50:18.411 --> 00:50:20.121
don't bother coming next week.

00:50:20.205 --> 00:50:21.623
Sorry? But ma'am.

00:50:21.706 --> 00:50:25.293
I'll deduct the price of the bowl
from your salary. Got it?

00:50:26.294 --> 00:50:27.838
Are you okay, A-reum?

00:50:27.921 --> 00:50:28.839
Wait, ma'am.

00:50:28.922 --> 00:50:31.341
You can't kick me out like this.

00:50:31.424 --> 00:50:33.009
Ma'am!

00:50:35.053 --> 00:50:36.847
Should we wrap up today's meeting now?

00:50:39.933 --> 00:50:42.853
Actually, I was at the Ministry of Justice
for a meeting,

00:50:42.936 --> 00:50:43.937
and everyone was talking.

00:50:44.020 --> 00:50:46.773
"What's going on at Oh & Partners?"

00:50:47.440 --> 00:50:50.318
"Why are you handling
a stray dog case?"

00:50:50.402 --> 00:50:53.113
Do you think it'll help our firm's revenue

00:50:53.196 --> 00:50:54.906
if we become enemies with the prosecution?

00:50:55.615 --> 00:50:57.158
Tell them to drop the case now.

00:50:57.826 --> 00:50:59.327
I almost forgot.

00:50:59.411 --> 00:51:01.746
Now that you mention revenue…

00:51:06.626 --> 00:51:09.212
Here's the revenue you brought in
during the past six months.

00:51:10.964 --> 00:51:12.924
Time can be brutal.

00:51:13.008 --> 00:51:13.925
Don't you think?

00:51:14.634 --> 00:51:18.305
In the past, you two used to earn
the most revenue for our firm.

00:51:21.933 --> 00:51:24.019
If you look at the bottom,
there's a list detailing

00:51:24.102 --> 00:51:27.564
the salaries of your secretaries
and drivers and your company card usage.

00:51:27.647 --> 00:51:28.815
Please take note of this.

00:51:30.817 --> 00:51:31.818
Ms. Oh.

00:51:31.902 --> 00:51:32.819
Yes, Mr. Cha?

00:51:36.281 --> 00:51:38.074
If you have nothing to say,
I'll get going.

00:51:45.832 --> 00:51:47.417
-How did it go?
-What?

00:51:47.500 --> 00:51:49.377
They want to stop
the abandoned dog case.

00:51:49.461 --> 00:51:53.632
Korea's top law firm can't pull out
after making a scene. It's embarrassing.

00:51:54.966 --> 00:51:58.511
-Isn't that what you wanted?
-I'm just doing my best.

00:51:59.346 --> 00:52:00.972
I don't need your best. I need results.

00:52:03.141 --> 00:52:04.809
She can't lose her granddaughter twice.

00:52:07.395 --> 00:52:08.271
Jung-in.

00:52:11.024 --> 00:52:13.026
I was also there at that street festival

00:52:14.069 --> 00:52:15.070
on that day.

00:52:18.615 --> 00:52:19.866
You have to win the case.

00:52:30.210 --> 00:52:31.628
He comes in.

00:52:35.048 --> 00:52:36.549
Your Honor,

00:52:37.175 --> 00:52:38.760
and ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

00:52:39.386 --> 00:52:42.889
we will make an argument
based on the testimony you just heard.

00:52:44.641 --> 00:52:46.017
It was a right of necessity,

00:52:46.643 --> 00:52:48.895
also known as a justified act…

00:52:48.979 --> 00:52:50.188
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:52:50.689 --> 00:52:53.274
what would you do if it were you?

00:52:54.359 --> 00:52:55.735
ATTORNEY, YOO NAN-HUI

00:52:57.195 --> 00:52:59.030
Ma'am, you would help save a life.

00:52:59.114 --> 00:53:00.824
I wouldn't make a difference.

00:53:00.907 --> 00:53:03.284
I've never been to such a place.
I'm too scared of them.

00:53:14.713 --> 00:53:15.755
Counsel.

00:53:15.839 --> 00:53:16.673
JURY TRIAL

00:53:16.756 --> 00:53:18.675
-You may examine the witness.
-Yes, Your Honor.

00:53:19.467 --> 00:53:20.468
Ma'am,

00:53:20.552 --> 00:53:22.429
you've been working as a maid

00:53:22.512 --> 00:53:24.848
at the plaintiff's house
for three years now. Correct?

00:53:24.931 --> 00:53:25.765
Yes.

00:53:25.849 --> 00:53:28.059
And you know
the abandoned dog in this case?

00:53:28.143 --> 00:53:29.227
Yes.

00:53:29.310 --> 00:53:32.397
Their daughter made a fuss
because she wanted a big dog,

00:53:32.480 --> 00:53:34.065
so Ms. Lee bought one.

00:53:34.649 --> 00:53:36.735
But since the child
changes her mind often,

00:53:36.818 --> 00:53:38.445
she soon got sick of it.

00:53:38.528 --> 00:53:40.572
I see.

00:53:40.655 --> 00:53:43.616
I assume the way the dog was treated
changed after that.

00:53:43.700 --> 00:53:47.787
Of course.
It was thought of as a nuisance.

00:53:47.871 --> 00:53:50.665
"Dog food costs too much.
Just give it half the amount."

00:53:50.749 --> 00:53:52.292
"Its barking annoys me."

00:53:52.375 --> 00:53:53.334
Ma'am!

00:53:54.461 --> 00:53:55.795
And then,

00:53:55.879 --> 00:53:58.089
they bought some kind of collar
from somewhere.

00:53:59.007 --> 00:54:01.342
After that, the dog wouldn't bark at all.

00:54:01.426 --> 00:54:04.095
Did the collar
look like this by any chance?

00:54:04.846 --> 00:54:06.222
Yes, I'm wearing it now.

00:54:06.306 --> 00:54:09.517
I'll make some noise now.

00:54:10.894 --> 00:54:13.938
It doesn't give you a shock right away.

00:54:14.022 --> 00:54:16.149
Instead, a warning alarm goes off.

00:54:16.232 --> 00:54:18.651
I'll try it again.

00:54:23.364 --> 00:54:26.451
Your Honor,
this question is irrelevant to the case.

00:54:26.534 --> 00:54:28.244
It is relevant! Do you know how much it…

00:54:28.787 --> 00:54:29.871
That's abuse.

00:54:31.873 --> 00:54:35.251
The question is a premise
to our argument, Your Honor.

00:54:36.002 --> 00:54:37.003
Okay.

00:54:38.088 --> 00:54:39.089
You may continue.

00:54:40.507 --> 00:54:44.344
Ms. Kim, was the collar
similar to the one we just saw?

00:54:44.427 --> 00:54:45.678
Yes, it was.

00:54:45.762 --> 00:54:47.847
Whenever she barked, she'd choke.

00:54:47.931 --> 00:54:49.516
And she was so much in pain.

00:54:51.059 --> 00:54:53.686
It's only an animal, but I felt so bad.

00:54:53.770 --> 00:54:56.314
You can't wear sunglasses in court.

00:54:56.397 --> 00:54:58.274
I'm on an undercover mission.

00:54:58.358 --> 00:55:02.737
But why would they suddenly look
for the dog after a year and a half?

00:55:03.279 --> 00:55:05.281
It's because of the fickle child.

00:55:05.365 --> 00:55:08.660
She went to a dog cafe
with her friends and saw the dog.

00:55:09.244 --> 00:55:11.538
"Why is my dog at someone else's house?"

00:55:11.621 --> 00:55:12.914
"Bring her back now!"

00:55:12.997 --> 00:55:15.542
-She cried and made such a fuss.
-Objection!

00:55:15.625 --> 00:55:19.462
What happened after the theft
is irrelevant to the case.

00:55:19.546 --> 00:55:20.672
-Sustained--
-Yes, sustained.

00:55:20.755 --> 00:55:21.798
I'll withdraw my question.

00:55:21.881 --> 00:55:23.299
Just disregard that question

00:55:23.383 --> 00:55:25.343
-and answer you just heard.
-Counsel!

00:55:25.426 --> 00:55:26.427
Yes, Your Honor?

00:55:26.511 --> 00:55:27.887
What you just said…

00:55:27.971 --> 00:55:30.932
I decide and say that myself
as a judge. Understood?

00:55:31.808 --> 00:55:34.519
It's a habit ingrained in me
from my former job, so…

00:55:34.602 --> 00:55:35.937
Okay. Go back.

00:55:36.729 --> 00:55:37.856
I'll be careful, Your Honor.

00:55:49.325 --> 00:55:50.326
Your Honor.

00:55:52.162 --> 00:55:53.580
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury.

00:55:53.663 --> 00:55:56.583
As you just saw,
the abandoned dog in this case

00:55:56.666 --> 00:55:59.294
suffered from electric shocks all day

00:55:59.377 --> 00:56:02.672
and was in a state of serious starvation.

00:56:02.755 --> 00:56:07.135
The defendant Ji So-yeon thought
if she sent the dog back to the abuser,

00:56:07.218 --> 00:56:10.388
something worse would happen.

00:56:10.471 --> 00:56:14.267
So, she cut the collar off
and found a new caregiver.

00:56:15.226 --> 00:56:20.523
It was a right of necessity,
also known as a justified act,

00:56:21.524 --> 00:56:22.525
so she's not guilty.

00:56:22.609 --> 00:56:24.152
That's a ridiculous argument.

00:56:24.235 --> 00:56:28.907
A right of necessity is established
only when a person faces an urgent crisis.

00:56:28.990 --> 00:56:32.493
A right of necessity for a dog,
which is the owner's property?

00:56:32.577 --> 00:56:35.121
It's an argument without any knowledge
of a basic criminal law.

00:56:35.205 --> 00:56:36.039
Yes, that's right.

00:56:37.332 --> 00:56:39.959
Under the law,
animals are thought of as merely property.

00:56:40.043 --> 00:56:42.128
Although I don't know anything
about criminal law,

00:56:42.212 --> 00:56:44.297
let me ask you something then.

00:56:44.380 --> 00:56:47.133
If animals are only property,

00:56:47.759 --> 00:56:49.761
then why do we punish people

00:56:49.844 --> 00:56:52.513
for animal abuse
when they abuse their own property?

00:56:52.597 --> 00:56:54.432
-That's--
-Let me ask another question.

00:56:54.515 --> 00:56:56.935
Your colleagues and predecessors

00:56:57.018 --> 00:57:00.021
worked hard at the Ministry of Justice
to research and create

00:57:00.104 --> 00:57:04.359
Article 98-2, Paragraph 1
of the Civil Code Amendment.

00:57:05.401 --> 00:57:06.736
Do you know what it is?

00:57:08.488 --> 00:57:12.200
"Animals are not objects."

00:57:13.368 --> 00:57:15.995
They are living things,
not objects, Prosecutor.

00:57:17.455 --> 00:57:20.708
The defendant only wanted
to protect a life.

00:57:23.002 --> 00:57:25.630
Ladies and gentlemen,
you're all sensible citizens of Korea.

00:57:26.673 --> 00:57:28.925
What would you do if it were you?

00:57:30.176 --> 00:57:33.972
You have no choice but to send the dog
back to a habitually abusive owner.

00:57:34.055 --> 00:57:36.182
If you can't find a new guardian in time,

00:57:36.266 --> 00:57:38.434
she has to be euthanized.

00:57:38.518 --> 00:57:40.728
Do you truly believe

00:57:41.646 --> 00:57:45.024
what the defendant did was a crime?

00:57:47.944 --> 00:57:49.988
-Nothing further, Your Honor.
-Okay, thank you.

00:57:52.657 --> 00:57:53.783
That was pretty good.

00:57:53.866 --> 00:57:56.828
It sounded a bit like The Attorney,
but it might have worked.

00:57:56.911 --> 00:57:58.079
Your Honor.

00:57:59.622 --> 00:58:02.584
If only that prick wasn't here.

00:58:03.251 --> 00:58:06.796
As counsel for the plaintiff,
I'd like to say something.

00:58:06.879 --> 00:58:08.006
Okay, then…

00:58:08.881 --> 00:58:12.176
-Come on out, so everyone can hear you.
-Thank you, Your Honor.

00:58:15.138 --> 00:58:18.641
The defense is following
a well-prepared script

00:58:18.725 --> 00:58:21.603
to maliciously frame the plaintiff.

00:58:21.686 --> 00:58:25.398
May I request
to ask the witness just one thing?

00:58:26.190 --> 00:58:27.442
Go ahead.

00:58:29.777 --> 00:58:33.865
Please ask the witness
if she has ever stolen

00:58:33.948 --> 00:58:35.575
-the plaintiff's necklace.
-Objection.

00:58:35.658 --> 00:58:39.495
-This question is irrelevant to the case.
-No, it is relevant.

00:58:39.579 --> 00:58:44.042
It's a question that concerns
the credibility of the defense's witness.

00:58:45.752 --> 00:58:47.962
Ms. Kim, did you hear the question?

00:58:48.046 --> 00:58:49.922
-Please answer.
-Sorry?

00:58:51.799 --> 00:58:53.092
No.

00:58:53.176 --> 00:58:55.345
I'm not that kind of a person.

00:58:55.428 --> 00:58:58.222
Why would I lay hands
on someone else's stuff?

00:58:58.306 --> 00:59:00.475
The plaintiff always keeps
a camera installed

00:59:00.558 --> 00:59:03.269
in the room
where she stores her valuables.

00:59:03.353 --> 00:59:06.981
I hereby submit a video recording
of the crime scene as evidence.

00:59:08.900 --> 00:59:09.942
Wait…

00:59:10.860 --> 00:59:12.403
I…

00:59:12.487 --> 00:59:14.572
No, it's not that.

00:59:16.115 --> 00:59:19.661
My unpaid salary
due to all sorts of excuses

00:59:19.744 --> 00:59:21.371
exceeded ten million won.

00:59:21.454 --> 00:59:24.332
But she fired me all of a sudden.

00:59:24.415 --> 00:59:29.504
I just thought I should get
what I should have been paid.

00:59:29.587 --> 00:59:30.797
So that's why?

00:59:31.506 --> 00:59:35.426
What you've heard so far
was a testimony from a thief

00:59:35.510 --> 00:59:37.804
who stole from her boss out of spite.

00:59:37.887 --> 00:59:40.890
Abuse against her dog?
That's a ridiculous false accusation.

00:59:40.973 --> 00:59:43.476
After having her dog,
who she adored like her own child,

00:59:43.559 --> 00:59:45.520
stolen by shameless people,

00:59:45.603 --> 00:59:48.898
the plaintiff has been suffering
immense mental anguish.

00:59:48.981 --> 00:59:51.984
Objection, Your Honor.
Do not insult the defendants.

00:59:52.068 --> 00:59:55.571
Also, the defense hasn't been able
to provide any concrete evidence

00:59:55.655 --> 00:59:59.242
other than the false testimony
they have prepared.

00:59:59.325 --> 01:00:00.827
A electric shock collar?

01:00:00.910 --> 01:00:03.996
If there is such a thing,
submit it as evidence.

01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:05.581
Wouldn't that be the case, Counsel?

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:09.627
Also, Ms. Park.

01:00:09.711 --> 01:00:11.963
I enjoyed that touching speech of yours.

01:00:12.046 --> 01:00:16.050
But about that amendment
saying "animals are not objects."

01:00:16.134 --> 01:00:18.803
It was passed
by the National Assembly, right?

01:00:22.724 --> 01:00:23.558
Not yet.

01:00:24.392 --> 01:00:25.393
Not yet?

01:00:28.020 --> 01:00:31.399
I thought it'd already been passed
since you sounded so confident.

01:00:31.482 --> 01:00:33.693
The members of the jury
aren't experts on this,

01:00:33.776 --> 01:00:35.737
so they would've been mistaken too.

01:00:35.820 --> 01:00:39.949
If that was your intention,
I'm even more impressed.

01:00:40.032 --> 01:00:43.035
She's a very promising attorney.

01:00:43.119 --> 01:00:45.747
I was only trying to show
how the social norms are changing--

01:00:45.830 --> 01:00:47.749
That is all, Your Honor.

01:00:48.291 --> 01:00:49.417
Thank you.

01:00:49.500 --> 01:00:50.585
Please return to your seat.

01:00:52.670 --> 01:00:57.175
If there are no further questions,
we will conclude the witness examination.

01:00:57.258 --> 01:01:00.928
We'll take a short recess
before the closing arguments.

01:01:03.681 --> 01:01:05.141
I'm sorry.

01:01:06.100 --> 01:01:08.436
I should have looked more deeply into it.

01:01:08.519 --> 01:01:09.979
No. It's all right, Nan-hui.

01:01:10.062 --> 01:01:13.316
How could you have seen that coming?

01:01:16.778 --> 01:01:18.237
But what do we do now?

01:01:19.030 --> 01:01:23.075
We need that collar to prove the abuse.

01:01:23.743 --> 01:01:25.077
He should be here by now.

01:01:25.703 --> 01:01:26.537
Sorry?

01:01:26.621 --> 01:01:28.247
-Mr. Kang!
-There he is.

01:01:29.081 --> 01:01:29.916
Jun-u?

01:01:33.753 --> 01:01:35.171
Where is it?

01:01:35.254 --> 01:01:37.048
I'm sorry. I thought I'd finally found it.

01:01:41.886 --> 01:01:43.304
But it wasn't it.

01:01:43.387 --> 01:01:45.473
It was just junk brought in
by heavy rain last time.

01:01:49.435 --> 01:01:50.978
Was it too impossible to try?

01:01:51.062 --> 01:01:52.230
I'm sorry.

01:01:52.939 --> 01:01:54.690
What now, Mr. Kang?

01:01:54.774 --> 01:01:56.192
Are we at a dead end?

01:01:57.735 --> 01:01:59.153
Let me use the restroom.

01:02:00.905 --> 01:02:02.907
Staying clean is his concern
at a time like this?

01:02:04.575 --> 01:02:06.536
JURY BOX

01:02:06.619 --> 01:02:07.453
What's with him?

01:02:08.162 --> 01:02:08.996
Counsel?

01:02:09.664 --> 01:02:10.623
Counsel!

01:02:11.749 --> 01:02:13.251
Yes, an animal is an object.

01:02:14.585 --> 01:02:17.839
The prosecution's arguments
are all valid from a legal standpoint.

01:02:18.965 --> 01:02:23.219
Under the current law,
pets are their owners' property.

01:02:23.302 --> 01:02:26.305
The right of necessity
or the justifiable act to save an object.

01:02:27.348 --> 01:02:28.391
The court won't accept it.

01:02:29.058 --> 01:02:30.059
I know that very well.

01:02:30.142 --> 01:02:32.603
How could a society
that can't take care of humans

01:02:32.687 --> 01:02:34.188
take care of the lives of animals?

01:02:35.606 --> 01:02:37.066
You're asking for too much.

01:02:37.149 --> 01:02:38.860
Are you crazy, Mr. Kang?

01:02:38.943 --> 01:02:40.653
Your Honor, I'd like to check

01:02:41.362 --> 01:02:44.156
just one thing with the plaintiff.

01:02:45.575 --> 01:02:48.369
I request permission
to examine the plaintiff as a witness.

01:02:50.496 --> 01:02:52.623
Then, Counsel,

01:02:53.207 --> 01:02:55.585
be short and quick.

01:02:56.168 --> 01:02:57.086
Yes, Your Honor.

01:02:57.169 --> 01:02:58.129
The plaintiff!

01:02:59.046 --> 01:03:00.756
Please come to the witness stand.

01:03:00.840 --> 01:03:02.008
What?

01:03:02.091 --> 01:03:03.092
Come on out!

01:03:03.968 --> 01:03:05.094
Yes, Your Honor.

01:03:10.349 --> 01:03:11.225
Your Honor.

01:03:11.309 --> 01:03:13.603
I have an object to show the plaintiff.

01:03:14.312 --> 01:03:18.149
I request permission
for Exhibit 12 to enter the courtroom.

01:03:19.942 --> 01:03:22.069
Counsel, Exhibit 12 is…

01:03:22.737 --> 01:03:24.655
-Come on. That's…
-Yes.

01:03:24.739 --> 01:03:26.449
It's evidence, after all.

01:03:26.532 --> 01:03:29.869
It's an object, so I can submit it
to the court, can't I?

01:03:29.952 --> 01:03:31.078
What should we do?

01:03:31.162 --> 01:03:32.830
Do we allow it or not?

01:03:34.624 --> 01:03:35.625
My goodness.

01:03:37.084 --> 01:03:39.545
Sure. Okay.

01:03:39.629 --> 01:03:40.755
Thank you, Your Honor.

01:03:42.715 --> 01:03:43.716
Sir?

01:03:46.928 --> 01:03:48.304
Oh, my gosh!

01:04:00.066 --> 01:04:01.442
Byeol!

01:04:06.948 --> 01:04:08.991
Byeol!

01:04:12.244 --> 01:04:13.371
Byeol.

01:04:30.763 --> 01:04:32.974
That's what pets do.

01:04:33.057 --> 01:04:35.726
Even if the owner hated hearing her bark

01:04:35.810 --> 01:04:38.396
and put an electric shock collar on
that burned her throat…

01:04:40.231 --> 01:04:43.734
Even if the owner tried starving her
because abandoning her was a hassle…

01:04:44.360 --> 01:04:46.570
she saw the owner
for the first time in a while

01:04:47.822 --> 01:04:50.241
and couldn't help but lick
the back of their owner's hand.

01:04:52.493 --> 01:04:56.372
They exist solely to love humans.

01:04:57.206 --> 01:04:58.499
That's what a pet is.

01:05:01.419 --> 01:05:03.170
We got it.
Look at the faces of the jury.

01:05:03.254 --> 01:05:05.214
We have circumstantial
but no physical evidence.

01:05:05.297 --> 01:05:06.674
How do we prove the abuse?

01:05:06.757 --> 01:05:08.634
Who made them this way?

01:05:08.718 --> 01:05:10.553
It was us humans.

01:05:10.636 --> 01:05:14.390
We captured wild animals as we pleased,
and tamed and bred them

01:05:14.473 --> 01:05:17.309
to make them love humans instinctively.

01:05:18.519 --> 01:05:20.896
Yes. Since we made them
out of our necessity,

01:05:20.980 --> 01:05:23.399
we can just toss them out
if we don't need them anymore.

01:05:24.150 --> 01:05:28.362
Our claim of right of necessity
and a justifiable act for such objects.

01:05:30.364 --> 01:05:32.825
We'll withdraw it. Your Honor.

01:05:33.951 --> 01:05:35.619
But just for the last time,

01:05:36.287 --> 01:05:39.749
I want to reconfirm one basic fact

01:05:39.832 --> 01:05:41.250
before closing my argument.

01:05:41.333 --> 01:05:42.668
Sure.

01:05:43.335 --> 01:05:44.503
Ms. Lee.

01:05:44.587 --> 01:05:47.423
Take a good look at the dog.

01:05:59.852 --> 01:06:02.396
Look closely.

01:06:03.022 --> 01:06:04.065
Stay.

01:06:07.735 --> 01:06:10.112
Did you really think
she threw the collar away?

01:06:15.993 --> 01:06:18.537
You just need to answer
one simple question.

01:06:19.830 --> 01:06:20.748
This dog right here…

01:06:21.791 --> 01:06:23.501
Is this…

01:06:24.585 --> 01:06:25.461
your dog?

01:06:29.381 --> 01:06:31.050
-What?
-What?

01:06:32.635 --> 01:06:33.844
What is he doing?

01:06:34.470 --> 01:06:36.263
Why on earth are you asking that now?

01:06:36.347 --> 01:06:38.265
In a criminal trial,

01:06:38.349 --> 01:06:41.936
we should leave no room
for any reasonable doubt.

01:06:43.062 --> 01:06:45.648
Even if there's a 1% chance of error,

01:06:45.731 --> 01:06:47.441
until the very end

01:06:47.525 --> 01:06:48.609
of the trial…

01:06:49.318 --> 01:06:51.487
we have to keep questioning it.

01:06:52.113 --> 01:06:53.739
When you think about it,

01:06:53.823 --> 01:06:56.784
there are many dogs
of the same breed and size.

01:06:58.119 --> 01:06:59.161
Ms. Lee.

01:07:02.498 --> 01:07:03.624
Take a good look.

01:07:04.166 --> 01:07:06.627
Is she really

01:07:07.378 --> 01:07:09.630
the dog that you lost?

01:07:16.804 --> 01:07:18.389
You seem flustered.

01:07:20.975 --> 01:07:21.934
Take a sip of water.

01:07:30.693 --> 01:07:32.403
What's with her?

01:07:40.411 --> 01:07:41.787
Excuse me.

01:07:41.871 --> 01:07:42.955
Your Honor!

01:07:43.038 --> 01:07:44.373
Yes, go ahead.

01:07:45.833 --> 01:07:48.085
I'm not feeling well right now.

01:07:48.169 --> 01:07:49.920
Can we take…

01:07:51.630 --> 01:07:52.840
a five-minute break?

01:07:54.675 --> 01:07:55.926
Well, in that case,

01:07:57.261 --> 01:07:58.846
we'll take a ten-minute recess.

01:08:03.309 --> 01:08:04.852
What are you doing, Mr. Kang?

01:08:05.936 --> 01:08:06.770
What?

01:08:06.854 --> 01:08:09.857
The dog belonged to plaintiff. It's Byeol.

01:08:16.113 --> 01:08:17.031
Are you all right?

01:08:17.698 --> 01:08:19.200
Yes, I am.

01:08:19.283 --> 01:08:22.536
It's hard to think straight
with Kang Da-wit making a fuss, isn't it?

01:08:23.287 --> 01:08:24.747
Don't let him get to you.

01:08:25.289 --> 01:08:26.415
Let's end this quickly.

01:08:27.374 --> 01:08:28.459
Right.

01:08:31.837 --> 01:08:34.048
Ten minutes are long.

01:08:35.341 --> 01:08:36.342
So,

01:08:37.134 --> 01:08:39.428
do you feel better, Ms. Lee?

01:08:39.511 --> 01:08:40.346
Yes.

01:08:42.014 --> 01:08:43.015
That's good.

01:08:43.098 --> 01:08:46.018
I'm just checking
since I just can't understand.

01:08:46.101 --> 01:08:47.561
Right?

01:08:47.645 --> 01:08:50.356
You're the daughter
of a former chief prosecutor

01:08:50.439 --> 01:08:53.442
and assemblyman
who's been elected three times.

01:08:55.027 --> 01:08:59.448
You're a sophisticated person raised
by a family that upholds law and order.

01:08:59.531 --> 01:09:02.117
Would such a person
put an illegal electric shock collar

01:09:02.201 --> 01:09:03.118
on their dog?

01:09:05.246 --> 01:09:07.998
Or starve and neglect her
so she would die?

01:09:08.082 --> 01:09:11.585
Would such a person
do such horrible things?

01:09:11.669 --> 01:09:14.380
But if that's the case by any chance,

01:09:15.422 --> 01:09:17.299
if any concrete evidence shows up…

01:09:17.383 --> 01:09:18.425
My goodness!

01:09:18.509 --> 01:09:20.719
This would make headlines!

01:09:20.803 --> 01:09:23.347
It'd be on the news,
in newspapers, and on social media.

01:09:23.430 --> 01:09:25.099
Come on. There's no way.

01:09:25.182 --> 01:09:28.227
Your Honor, Counsel keeps making arguments

01:09:28.310 --> 01:09:30.604
-without any proof--
-Excuse me. Sit down.

01:09:32.606 --> 01:09:34.358
-Ms. Lee.
-What's going on?

01:09:35.442 --> 01:09:36.944
This is your last chance.

01:09:44.868 --> 01:09:46.495
Look at her again

01:09:47.913 --> 01:09:50.082
very closely.

01:09:51.125 --> 01:09:53.168
This poor abandoned dog

01:09:53.252 --> 01:09:55.796
was brutally abused and thrown out.

01:09:56.630 --> 01:10:00.384
Is she really the dog you lost?

01:10:04.096 --> 01:10:05.014
I see.

01:10:05.097 --> 01:10:07.474
Since we can't prove the abuse,

01:10:07.558 --> 01:10:11.562
we have to make the plaintiff
change her words and say it's not her dog.

01:10:12.896 --> 01:10:15.941
But is that possible
when there is no evidence?

01:10:27.077 --> 01:10:27.911
No.

01:10:29.330 --> 01:10:30.539
Sorry, what did you say?

01:10:30.622 --> 01:10:32.916
It's hard to hear,
so could you say it louder, please?

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:34.251
No!

01:10:34.335 --> 01:10:35.836
No, it's not mine.

01:10:35.919 --> 01:10:39.089
That dog does look a lot like our Chloe,

01:10:39.173 --> 01:10:40.966
but after seeing her up close,
it's not her.

01:10:41.050 --> 01:10:44.011
My Chloe was different
from that mixed-breed dog.

01:10:44.094 --> 01:10:46.180
I'll drop the charges!

01:10:46.263 --> 01:10:48.057
-Oh, my gosh!
-I'm sorry.

01:10:48.140 --> 01:10:49.350
-My goodness.
-I was…

01:10:50.184 --> 01:10:51.185
I was…

01:10:52.853 --> 01:10:54.605
I was mistaken!

01:10:55.647 --> 01:10:59.735
That dog isn't mine!

01:10:59.818 --> 01:11:00.736
Hold on!

01:11:00.819 --> 01:11:03.238
What are you doing, Ms. Lee?

01:11:03.781 --> 01:11:06.742
After all this, why are you saying that?

01:11:10.871 --> 01:11:12.081
Yes.

01:11:12.748 --> 01:11:15.125
You can bark all you want now.

01:11:15.209 --> 01:11:16.710
My Byeol.

01:11:16.794 --> 01:11:19.088
You're not Chloe.

01:11:19.963 --> 01:11:21.548
Counsel,

01:11:21.632 --> 01:11:23.467
are you done with your examination?

01:11:24.134 --> 01:11:25.386
Nothing further, Your Honor.

01:11:25.469 --> 01:11:27.471
If the examination is over,

01:11:27.554 --> 01:11:28.472
please take her away.

01:11:31.600 --> 01:11:33.060
Byeol!

01:11:42.778 --> 01:11:44.238
You seem flustered.

01:11:46.365 --> 01:11:47.866
Take a sip of water.

01:11:52.496 --> 01:11:55.666
Call your dad right now.

01:11:58.085 --> 01:12:00.045
-Dad?
-Hey.

01:12:00.129 --> 01:12:02.714
-Are you out of your mind?
-Dad, what is it?

01:12:02.798 --> 01:12:04.216
Judge Kang, that fool.

01:12:04.299 --> 01:12:06.009
He just called and threatened me.

01:12:06.093 --> 01:12:09.430
He said you abused an animal.

01:12:09.513 --> 01:12:11.640
He said he has evidence too. Is this true?

01:12:12.474 --> 01:12:13.600
No, Dad. It's not what--

01:12:13.684 --> 01:12:15.644
If it's true,

01:12:15.727 --> 01:12:18.147
my official nomination
for general elections will be gone.

01:12:18.230 --> 01:12:20.732
Do you know how many people
with pets there are in my district?

01:12:20.816 --> 01:12:23.110
If my political career ends
because of you,

01:12:23.193 --> 01:12:25.487
don't even dream
of asking me for anything.

01:12:25.571 --> 01:12:27.406
There won't be
any studying abroad for A-reum!

01:12:27.489 --> 01:12:29.658
-You got that?
-Dad!

01:12:29.741 --> 01:12:30.617
That's not the…

01:12:31.201 --> 01:12:34.329
Dad!

01:12:36.081 --> 01:12:37.666
CALL YOUR DAD RIGHT NOW

01:12:37.749 --> 01:12:39.585
Wait. What…

01:12:40.210 --> 01:12:44.173
What on earth happened?
What was that thing around Byeol's neck?

01:12:44.256 --> 01:12:45.591
I didn't find the collar.

01:12:46.633 --> 01:12:49.511
I don't know. I have no idea either.

01:12:49.595 --> 01:12:51.972
We can't buy it on the market.

01:12:52.055 --> 01:12:54.016
Our multi-talented Mr. Jang,

01:12:54.099 --> 01:12:55.601
do you have any good ideas?

01:12:57.478 --> 01:12:59.146
For the leather part,

01:12:59.229 --> 01:13:01.648
I can simply get it
from the Cheonggyecheon area.

01:13:01.732 --> 01:13:03.275
For the metal buckle,

01:13:03.817 --> 01:13:06.111
I can weld together some similar material

01:13:06.195 --> 01:13:07.738
to make it look pretty similar.

01:13:08.614 --> 01:13:10.115
Just give me two days.

01:13:10.199 --> 01:13:12.451
You'll be able to fool the eyes
for a moment.

01:13:15.621 --> 01:13:17.498
Then that means we won, right?

01:13:17.581 --> 01:13:19.166
The jurors' faces said it all.

01:13:20.209 --> 01:13:23.879
I guess they were pretending not to know.
The plaintiff said it wasn't her dog.

01:13:23.962 --> 01:13:24.796
-Right.
-Yeah.

01:13:24.880 --> 01:13:26.256
But you never know.

01:13:26.965 --> 01:13:29.051
Even if the jury wishes to acquit,

01:13:29.134 --> 01:13:31.720
the judge can say
it's an obvious error and overrule it.

01:13:31.803 --> 01:13:32.804
That's possible,

01:13:32.888 --> 01:13:33.805
but…

01:13:34.515 --> 01:13:36.725
Judge Choi won't do that.

01:13:36.808 --> 01:13:39.978
Why not?
You said he was as stubborn as a mule.

01:13:42.648 --> 01:13:44.149
What's your name?

01:13:44.233 --> 01:13:45.234
Your name.

01:13:45.984 --> 01:13:47.486
Paw.

01:13:47.569 --> 01:13:52.533
Judge Choi's nickname is Dog Dad.
Maybe it's because he doesn't have kids.

01:13:52.616 --> 01:13:55.369
He's raising three abandoned dogs
after adopting them.

01:13:56.203 --> 01:13:58.705
I heard he couldn't be kinder to them.

01:14:02.376 --> 01:14:05.587
Then, it wasn't just about avoiding
Criminal Division 1.

01:14:05.671 --> 01:14:08.632
You planned on handing the trial
to Judge Choi from the get-go?

01:14:16.223 --> 01:14:17.099
He's so awesome.

01:14:17.182 --> 01:14:18.517
Gosh, I hate him.

01:14:18.600 --> 01:14:19.726
I can hear you!

01:14:21.562 --> 01:14:22.563
Okay.

01:14:23.855 --> 01:14:26.233
I will now deliver the verdict.

01:14:26.817 --> 01:14:28.026
Defendants, please rise.

01:14:31.446 --> 01:14:34.575
Respecting the jury's unanimous opinion,

01:14:38.954 --> 01:14:40.455
the Court hereby finds the defendants

01:14:41.248 --> 01:14:42.374
not guilty.

01:14:47.713 --> 01:14:49.214
Of course, not guilty.

01:14:50.340 --> 01:14:51.550
I'm so relieved.

01:14:52.676 --> 01:14:54.136
All rise.

01:14:56.597 --> 01:14:58.223
Plaintiff!

01:14:58.307 --> 01:15:01.393
Chloe is your dog!
What do you mean you were mistaken?

01:15:02.894 --> 01:15:04.187
What a hearty character.

01:15:09.526 --> 01:15:10.986
Thank you.

01:15:11.903 --> 01:15:12.738
Thank you so much.

01:15:50.984 --> 01:15:52.235
It's been a while,

01:15:52.861 --> 01:15:53.862
Mr. Yoo Jae-beom.

01:15:55.322 --> 01:15:58.617
Yes, it has been a while, Ms. Oh.

01:16:00.035 --> 01:16:01.995
Sir, please drive safely.

01:16:13.090 --> 01:16:17.844
STAY TUNED TO WATCH THE EPILOGUE

01:16:39.408 --> 01:16:41.743
Why did you come to Team Pro Bono?

01:16:41.827 --> 01:16:43.370
Who are you suing again?

01:16:43.453 --> 01:16:44.579
God.

01:16:44.663 --> 01:16:45.997
I want compensation for damages.

01:16:46.081 --> 01:16:47.416
I said no.

01:16:47.499 --> 01:16:49.751
My very existence
in this world itself is damaging.

01:16:49.835 --> 01:16:51.670
Even if we might not win…

01:16:51.753 --> 01:16:54.673
Is a trial a live charity show
to help the needy?

01:16:54.756 --> 01:16:57.426
Making money is
the most pro bono thing we can do.

01:16:57.509 --> 01:16:59.636
I can't listen to this anymore!

01:16:59.720 --> 01:17:01.179
You stupid boomer!

01:17:01.263 --> 01:17:04.599
If the defendant is God,
I don't know what His mailing address is.

01:17:04.683 --> 01:17:07.769
It's 101 Dogok-ro.

01:17:07.853 --> 01:17:10.021
That's where I'm sending
the complaint for damages.

01:17:10.105 --> 01:17:11.398
He lives in Gangnam?

01:17:11.481 --> 01:17:13.024
This might be a ridiculous thought,

01:17:13.108 --> 01:17:15.986
but what if there was
some kind of intent behind all of this?

01:17:16.069 --> 01:17:18.989
It's probably runaway teenagers.

01:17:19.072 --> 01:17:19.906
Like So-min.

01:17:19.990 --> 01:17:23.827
I would like to sue Choi Woong-san,
the CEO of Woongsan Group,

01:17:23.910 --> 01:17:25.871
and have him stand trial.

01:17:31.585 --> 01:17:32.502
Mom!

01:17:32.586 --> 01:17:34.379
It hurts so much.

01:17:34.463 --> 01:17:37.257
Gosh, you should be glad it isn't worse.

01:17:37.340 --> 01:17:39.092
You could've been really hurt,
Da-wit.

01:17:39.885 --> 01:17:41.928
That stupid dog.

01:17:42.512 --> 01:17:44.097
If I ever see him again,

01:17:44.973 --> 01:17:47.142
I'll break his legs and--

01:17:48.310 --> 01:17:49.895
That won't happen.

01:17:50.437 --> 01:17:52.439
-Why not?
-When a dog bites someone,

01:17:52.522 --> 01:17:54.107
that becomes a habit.

01:17:54.191 --> 01:17:58.361
The owner said
he's going to sell the dog tonight.

01:17:59.321 --> 01:18:00.322
Really?

01:18:00.405 --> 01:18:02.824
What can you do? It's his decision.

01:18:04.075 --> 01:18:06.411
Okay. Let me see.

01:18:07.120 --> 01:18:07.954
Da-wit!

01:18:08.038 --> 01:18:09.956
-This is the dog.
-No!

01:18:11.249 --> 01:18:12.876
-Da-wit!
-You can't, sir!

01:18:12.959 --> 01:18:14.294
Hey, move!

01:18:14.377 --> 01:18:15.670
-You can't!
-You'll get hurt!

01:18:16.421 --> 01:18:17.672
You can't, sir!

01:18:17.756 --> 01:18:19.257
Don't send Jang-gun away.

01:18:19.883 --> 01:18:22.886
Once a dog bites a person,
it becomes a habit. You can't raise it.

01:18:22.969 --> 01:18:24.596
Move already!

01:18:24.679 --> 01:18:27.182
It was because I kept touching
and teasing him.

01:18:27.808 --> 01:18:29.810
So don't send him away!

01:18:30.393 --> 01:18:32.395
For crying out loud, this boy.

01:18:39.194 --> 01:18:41.196
