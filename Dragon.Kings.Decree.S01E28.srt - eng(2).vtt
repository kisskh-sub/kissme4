00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:00.700
Zhilou!

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:01.498
Bad news!

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:03.459
We couldn't find Yue at the apothecary.

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.978
That can't be!

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.618
Baiyue must have used

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:07.938
a demon artifact

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:09.419
to break through my barrier

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.900
and discovered her.

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.239
Yan,

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.119
did you come for me?

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:34.379
Mother,

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.539
please hand over
the city lordship and Miss Yue.

00:02:37.619 --> 00:02:39.778
I've already prepared

00:02:39.779 --> 00:02:41.338
a self‑accusation decree for you.

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:42.859
It'll be announced tomorrow.

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:44.419
Please stop resisting.

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:45.900
Yan,

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.020
do you think that because we don't carry

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:50.739
the Wujing Saintess bloodline,

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:53.459
we should return everything to them?

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:54.819
Shouldn't we?

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.180
You know exactly

00:02:58.219 --> 00:03:00.539
how we got here,

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.060
step by step.

00:03:03.779 --> 00:03:06.818
Everything we have belongs to us!

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:09.220
Why should they
take the rewards we earned?

00:03:10.219 --> 00:03:11.220
Mother,

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.819
you were the one who
stole everything from others!

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:15.539
Li Yan!

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:17.819
I'm your mother!

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:19.498
I gave you everything you have,

00:03:19.499 --> 00:03:21.979
including your position as Young Lord!

00:03:22.499 --> 00:03:24.979
I can earn my place on my own.

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:26.778
The people of Wujing never

00:03:26.779 --> 00:03:27.899
respected a City Lord

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.699
just because of bloodline.

00:03:30.219 --> 00:03:31.819
They only feared it.

00:03:32.219 --> 00:03:33.218
What they need is

00:03:33.219 --> 00:03:35.419
someone who can give them a better life.

00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:36.819
Mother,

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:38.539
kill him.

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:40.338
If you don't,

00:03:40.339 --> 00:03:42.020
he'll kill us.

00:03:43.499 --> 00:03:44.419
Guards!

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:48.419
Take Princess Liluo!

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:51.179
Li Yan,

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:52.419
you fool!

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.299
Let her go!

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:55.979
She's the Wujing Saintess!

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:58.579
No one will believe your accusations

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:00.020
tomorrow!

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:02.419
I'm the next City Lord.

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:04.300
These guards answer only to me.

00:04:04.779 --> 00:04:06.900
Mother, you're old. You should rest.

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:09.618
She hurt

00:04:09.619 --> 00:04:10.780
someone.

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:12.699
It's reasonable for me to detain her.

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:16.499
Take her away

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:17.978
and don't release her

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:19.218
without my permission!

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:19.900
Yes!

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:21.979
Go!

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:30.819
Li Yan,

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:32.619
she's your sister!

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.178
She's the Wujing Saintess!

00:04:35.179 --> 00:04:37.900
You can't treat her like this!

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:39.978
Li Yan!

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:42.820
(Yingyue Palace)

00:04:45.125 --> 00:04:49.858
(Yingyue Palace)

00:04:49.859 --> 00:04:51.299
Even if you keep silent,

00:04:51.339 --> 00:04:52.780
I'll find my mother.

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:59.020
You think this will make me give in?

00:04:59.219 --> 00:05:00.780
I'm not the one who came for you.

00:05:07.739 --> 00:05:08.619
Liluo,

00:05:08.779 --> 00:05:09.700
you know I

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:11.859
won't bend justice for family.

00:05:12.339 --> 00:05:13.099
Tell me

00:05:13.219 --> 00:05:14.700
where you hid Miss Yue.

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:19.659
Yan,

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:20.858
I grew up being told

00:05:20.859 --> 00:05:22.380
I'd become the Dragon Queen.

00:05:22.779 --> 00:05:24.579
I was so close.

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:25.539
Why?

00:05:26.179 --> 00:05:28.020
Why is it you?

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:30.859
Was all

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:33.179
your kindness fake?

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:37.538
Did she use this same voice

00:05:37.539 --> 00:05:39.299
to fool my mother?

00:05:39.779 --> 00:05:41.659
Feng Zhilou!

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:46.059
You're always selfish.

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:48.859
I didn't believe it at first.

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:50.658
When we were kids,

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:51.820
I always held you

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:52.858
and told Mother you'd

00:05:52.859 --> 00:05:55.099
be the greatest Wujing Saintess.

00:05:55.739 --> 00:05:57.700
You worked with outsiders to harm me?

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.499
She used a beauty trap and sent

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:02.538
Chu Xiaoyu to seduce you!

00:06:02.539 --> 00:06:03.900
You fell for it.

00:06:04.179 --> 00:06:05.418
Are you really willing

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:07.738
to ruin your own future just to stop me?

00:06:07.739 --> 00:06:08.940
You've

00:06:09.299 --> 00:06:10.380
grown up

00:06:11.179 --> 00:06:12.099
and changed.

00:06:12.339 --> 00:06:14.220
You can't take criticism anymore.

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:16.220
You blame everyone else.

00:06:16.739 --> 00:06:17.978
Everyone is wrong

00:06:17.979 --> 00:06:19.299
except you.

00:06:20.099 --> 00:06:21.380
Even me,

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:23.820
the brother you once adored.

00:06:24.299 --> 00:06:26.099
You refuse to see any good in me.

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:28.979
I worked so hard

00:06:29.739 --> 00:06:32.299
to become the Wujing Saintess.

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:34.139
Why are you taking the only

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:35.658
dream I've ever had?

00:06:35.659 --> 00:06:37.979
It's all I ever wanted!

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:42.580
Let's go.

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:44.939
She won't say anything about my mother.

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:46.259
I'll leave

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.099
in an hour.

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:49.538
Feng Zhilou,

00:06:49.539 --> 00:06:50.858
just wait!

00:06:50.859 --> 00:06:52.619
Your mother lost to mine,

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:53.338
and you will too!

00:06:53.339 --> 00:06:54.899
Even if you married Chu Moshang,

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:56.739
I'm the true Dragon Queen!

00:06:56.779 --> 00:06:58.059
Dragon Queen.

00:06:58.060 --> 00:06:59.619
Wujing Saintess.

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:02.218
Hearing those words

00:07:02.219 --> 00:07:03.700
from you is ridiculous.

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.820
If you rely on others,

00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:09.780
the moment they stop supporting you,

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:12.099
you'll have nothing.

00:07:13.219 --> 00:07:14.099
Let's go.

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:28.140
Li Yue,

00:07:28.299 --> 00:07:29.979
where did you hide my mother?

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:34.700
Is this how
a Wujing Saintess asks for help?

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:36.059
Oh.

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:39.140
You're not the Wujing Saintess yet.

00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:41.619
My daughter is.

00:07:42.779 --> 00:07:45.539
Li Yan is too soft.

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:47.179
If I were him,

00:07:47.219 --> 00:07:49.459
he'd have killed Liluo and me

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:50.939
the moment

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:52.619
he chose your side.

00:07:52.779 --> 00:07:54.820
I just want my mother back.

00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:56.739
I don't care

00:07:56.820 --> 00:07:58.179
about Wujing City

00:07:58.380 --> 00:07:59.700
or the sanctuary.

00:07:59.739 --> 00:08:01.260
You say that easily.

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:03.699
How am I supposed to trust you?

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:04.940
What do you want me to do?

00:08:05.179 --> 00:08:06.338
Feng Zhilou,

00:08:06.339 --> 00:08:08.978
you married Prince Shang,

00:08:08.979 --> 00:08:10.738
so I can't kill you.

00:08:10.739 --> 00:08:14.539
But I have Yue and the Feng Manor.

00:08:14.779 --> 00:08:16.899
You can't kill me either.

00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:19.580
You only need to prove you don't have

00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:22.020
the Wujing Saintess' bloodline.

00:08:22.099 --> 00:08:25.020
Then everything will be solved.

00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:27.059
Being the Wujing Saintess

00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:29.659
isn't just about bloodline.

00:08:31.779 --> 00:08:34.499
It's not that simple.

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:36.818
Why does the sanctuary test blood?

00:08:36.819 --> 00:08:38.339
And why is it

00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:41.460
your mother's blood that keeps me young?

00:08:42.059 --> 00:08:43.499
It's a gift

00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:46.259
given to the Wujing Saintess'

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:47.778
descendants.

00:08:47.779 --> 00:08:48.660
Enough.

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.739
I don't need your explanations.

00:08:51.939 --> 00:08:53.899
I just need you to obey,

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.339
no matter you accept my terms or not.

00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:59.259
You killed Dark Dhuta.

00:08:59.459 --> 00:09:02.739
You must already have

00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:04.019
the Saintess War God Constitution.

00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:05.259
So what if I do?

00:09:05.299 --> 00:09:06.458
Feng Zhilou,

00:09:06.459 --> 00:09:08.139
have you ever wondered

00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:11.660
why you survived until eighteen?

00:09:12.179 --> 00:09:13.340
Because of my father

00:09:13.659 --> 00:09:15.220
and the Feng Manor's protection.

00:09:17.419 --> 00:09:18.538
They

00:09:18.539 --> 00:09:21.259
let you waste

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.379
eighteen years.

00:09:23.579 --> 00:09:26.099
That's why I never cared about you

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:27.700
in Wujing City.

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:29.460
Baiyue.

00:09:37.179 --> 00:09:39.899
This is a demonic pill.

00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:41.178
It suppresses

00:09:41.179 --> 00:09:43.899
the spiritual roots
of ordinary cultivators.

00:09:44.059 --> 00:09:47.060
I want you to become useless again.

00:09:47.179 --> 00:09:50.580
Liluo will become the Dragon Queen.

00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:53.580
I'll release your mother afterward.

00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:58.300
(For the world)

00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:00.060
(or for my own kin.)

00:10:00.539 --> 00:10:02.420
(Do I really
have to sacrifice one side?)

00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:05.340
(Is there no way to save both?)

00:10:20.539 --> 00:10:21.340
Look

00:10:21.419 --> 00:10:22.058
who's back.

00:10:22.059 --> 00:10:22.899
Zhilou.

00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:25.859
Are you the Young Lord?

00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:27.099
Yes, Miss Yue.

00:10:27.419 --> 00:10:28.540
Your eyes...

00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:32.460
By order of the City Lord,

00:10:33.179 --> 00:10:35.940
Wu Jing City is now
heavily guarded to ensure

00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:38.060
the wedding ceremony
proceeds without issue.

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:39.298
Zhilou,

00:10:39.299 --> 00:10:41.180
what happened?

00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:50.259
I agree to your terms,

00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:52.979
but I need to see my mother first.

00:10:54.459 --> 00:10:57.460
You're smarter than your mother.

00:10:57.699 --> 00:11:00.178
I like talking to smart people.

00:11:00.179 --> 00:11:01.180
Guards,

00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:03.019
bring Yue.

00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:12.340
Zhilou.

00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:18.739
Mother.

00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:20.499
Feng Zhilou!

00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:22.818
(Don't forget.)

00:11:22.819 --> 00:11:24.259
(The lives of the entire Feng Manor)

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:25.979
(are in my hands.)

00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:28.778
(Even if you
dislike your former family,)

00:11:28.779 --> 00:11:30.698
(as a descendant of the Saintess,)

00:11:30.699 --> 00:11:33.660
(you can't watch innocent people die.)

00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:35.220
Zhilou,

00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:37.019
don't listen to them!

00:11:51.939 --> 00:11:53.778
Don't eat it, Zhilou!

00:11:53.779 --> 00:11:55.060
Zhilou!

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:01.859
Zhilou!

00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:28.298
Zhilou.

00:12:28.299 --> 00:12:29.219
Mother!

00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:30.340
Mother!

00:12:33.179 --> 00:12:34.580
Zhilou.

00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:40.340
Mother,

00:12:40.579 --> 00:12:42.060
I'm just glad you're safe.

00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:44.700
Your...

00:12:45.059 --> 00:12:46.660
Your eyes...

00:12:47.459 --> 00:12:49.660
You're even
more beautiful than I imagined.

00:12:54.459 --> 00:12:56.379
I dragged you down.

00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:58.060
I made you suffer.

00:12:59.819 --> 00:13:00.619
Mother,

00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:02.060
I never felt it was suffering.

00:13:02.299 --> 00:13:03.538
Life's only going

00:13:03.539 --> 00:13:04.899
to get sweeter from here.

00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:07.300
I'll take you out of Wujing City.

00:13:07.659 --> 00:13:09.540
We'll go back
to the Feng Manor together.

00:13:10.659 --> 00:13:12.940
I may not have cultivation now

00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:14.420
and can't help you,

00:13:15.579 --> 00:13:17.060
but believe me,

00:13:17.579 --> 00:13:20.060
the Dragon God and the Wujing Saintess

00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:22.460
won't spare the greedy.

00:13:27.539 --> 00:13:29.060
Have you ever thought about it?

00:13:29.179 --> 00:13:30.660
Once Liluo enters the sanctuary,

00:13:30.699 --> 00:13:32.499
she has to carry all its burdens,

00:13:32.539 --> 00:13:34.099
including the Dragon Queen's duties.

00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:35.499
We're human,

00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:37.019
not gods.

00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:39.220
It's normal if she
can't handle everything.

00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:40.859
But if she claims

00:13:40.939 --> 00:13:42.420
what's meant for gods,

00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:44.779
she must also carry their burdens.

00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:47.220
Everything has a price.

00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:50.499
Let's go.

00:13:52.939 --> 00:13:53.778
Zhilou,

00:13:53.779 --> 00:13:55.259
your spiritual root is gone.

00:14:03.179 --> 00:14:04.259
Feng Zhilou,

00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:07.899
Her Lordship and I
have met all your demands.

00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:10.178
I hope you'll keep your word.

00:14:10.179 --> 00:14:12.060
Young Lord,

00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:13.298
Her Lordship says

00:14:13.299 --> 00:14:15.700
she can't attend tomorrow's ceremony.

00:14:15.779 --> 00:14:17.779
We'll need you
to escort the bride for her.

00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:21.660
And to avoid any mishaps,

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:23.340
please come with me.

00:14:31.579 --> 00:14:32.460
Don't worry.

00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:34.060
I'll take good care of myself.

00:14:34.459 --> 00:14:36.779
Otherwise, how can I protect
Wujing and you in the future?

00:14:45.939 --> 00:14:47.739
You call this combing my hair?

00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:49.060
It hurts like hell!

00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:51.778
And this rouge is rough and cheap!

00:14:51.779 --> 00:14:53.019
Do you have a death wish?

00:14:53.539 --> 00:14:54.259
Get out!

00:14:59.939 --> 00:15:03.060
Your temper's still as fierce as ever.

00:15:09.059 --> 00:15:11.379
That's why I'm one of a kind, right?

00:15:11.659 --> 00:15:13.060
Watch yourself.

00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:16.580
The sanctuary doesn't
like Dragon Queens like you.

00:15:17.419 --> 00:15:19.259
I'm the Wujing Saintess.

00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:21.460
Their opinions don't matter.

00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:27.339
I heard

00:15:27.340 --> 00:15:28.178
something bad

00:15:28.179 --> 00:15:30.259
happened in Wujing City today.

00:15:30.539 --> 00:15:32.220
If any of you ruin

00:15:32.539 --> 00:15:34.420
my big day tomorrow,

00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:36.499
I won't forgive you.

00:15:37.939 --> 00:15:38.940
Zhi,

00:15:40.459 --> 00:15:42.139
if I weren't the Saintess,

00:15:42.699 --> 00:15:44.420
would you still marry me?

00:15:48.939 --> 00:15:50.700
Even if you weren't the Saintess,

00:15:51.299 --> 00:15:53.779
you'd still have that title for me

00:15:53.939 --> 00:15:55.859
until I become Dragon King.

00:15:57.260 --> 00:15:58.979
There's no love between us.

00:16:00.179 --> 00:16:01.340
Just a deal.

00:16:29.779 --> 00:16:30.619
Moshang,

00:16:31.539 --> 00:16:32.619
did you see?

00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:35.220
Today I'm marrying the Wujing Saintess.

00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:37.019
She's the wife you chose.

00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:38.379
Don't regret it.

00:16:38.380 --> 00:16:39.700
Regret?

00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:43.379
For a thousand years,
people only remember the Dragon King.

00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:46.540
No one cares who the king's wife is.

00:16:47.299 --> 00:16:49.859
I'm not like you.
I don't care about the world.

00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:51.259
All I know is

00:16:52.059 --> 00:16:53.379
you lost your chance

00:16:53.579 --> 00:16:55.379
at the throne today.

00:16:55.380 --> 00:16:56.099
When you finally

00:16:56.100 --> 00:16:57.820
understand who your wife really is,

00:16:58.659 --> 00:16:59.899
then come talk to me.

00:17:10.820 --> 00:17:11.819
Yan,

00:17:11.939 --> 00:17:14.498
this is the most
beautiful moment of my life.

00:17:14.499 --> 00:17:15.698
Shame

00:17:15.699 --> 00:17:17.299
you can't see it anymore.

00:17:17.459 --> 00:17:19.019
Good thing I can't.

00:17:19.580 --> 00:17:20.859
The sister I imagined

00:17:20.860 --> 00:17:21.819
was never

00:17:22.019 --> 00:17:23.579
married off like this.

00:17:23.580 --> 00:17:25.460
How unfortunate for you, then.

00:17:25.939 --> 00:17:27.658
(Heaven-Earth Hall)
You're staying with me

00:17:27.659 --> 00:17:29.299
in the mortal realm until the very end.

00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:30.100
Wait.

00:17:30.739 --> 00:17:31.978
Not everyone's here yet.

00:17:31.979 --> 00:17:32.940
Why rush?
