That guy gets out of prison next week.

00:01:10.485 --> 00:01:14.115
I promise I'll find you, son.

00:01:15.815 --> 00:01:17.555
I miss you, Min Ho.

00:01:27.535 --> 00:01:28.665
Today,

00:01:29.035 --> 00:01:31.965
I made that stir-fried japchae you love.

00:01:33.235 --> 00:01:36.275
I don't have much of an appetite eating all alone.

00:01:38.305 --> 00:01:39.945
I miss you, Min Ho.

00:01:41.245 --> 00:01:42.715
If only I could see you...

00:01:43.685 --> 00:01:44.815
just one more time...

00:01:45.685 --> 00:01:46.745
My dear son.

00:01:49.215 --> 00:01:51.225
(I miss you, Min Ho.)

00:01:56.595 --> 00:01:58.125
I miss you, Min Ho.

00:02:01.065 --> 00:02:02.935
Happy birthday, Min Ho.

00:02:04.305 --> 00:02:06.405
I miss you, Min Ho.

00:02:12.205 --> 00:02:15.615
Dad, you have to come right now. Hurry.

00:02:19.515 --> 00:02:20.515
Yes, Min Ho.

00:02:22.055 --> 00:02:23.185
(Watch Repair)

00:03:18.005 --> 00:03:19.545
Min Ho...

00:03:41.235 --> 00:03:44.665
So about that car accident case from 15 years ago you asked about...

00:03:45.065 --> 00:03:46.465
I looked into it,

00:03:47.235 --> 00:03:49.805
and it turns out there were no CCTV cameras in the area.

00:03:50.205 --> 00:03:52.045
And no witnesses either, of course.

00:03:52.605 --> 00:03:55.515
The statute of limitations expired, so the case is officially closed.

00:03:55.915 --> 00:03:58.545
Right now, besides the memories of those involved in the accident,

00:03:58.985 --> 00:04:00.955
there's pretty much nothing we can find out.

00:04:01.715 --> 00:04:03.255
Thanks for looking into it.

00:04:03.785 --> 00:04:05.325
Let me know if you need anything else.

00:04:06.085 --> 00:04:08.555
Hey, Seong Cheol. Let's grab some eel sometime.

00:04:09.155 --> 00:04:10.155
You're buying.

00:04:29.415 --> 00:04:30.515
I saw it.

00:04:31.645 --> 00:04:33.285
I saw it with my own two eyes.

00:04:38.085 --> 00:04:39.085
But...

00:04:42.595 --> 00:04:43.765
I can't remember.

00:04:46.095 --> 00:04:47.935
No matter how hard I try to remember,

00:04:50.135 --> 00:04:51.135
it's no use.

00:04:57.205 --> 00:05:02.245
(Taxi Driver 3)

00:05:02.315 --> 00:05:03.475
(Jingwang University)

00:05:03.545 --> 00:05:05.345
What's this? Showing up unannounced?

00:05:06.845 --> 00:05:09.185
Is Park Min Ho really dead?

00:05:09.655 --> 00:05:11.485
You buried him for good, right?

00:05:16.325 --> 00:05:17.464
Dong Hyeon.

00:05:17.465 --> 00:05:20.795
What is this, all of a sudden? Why ask me about Park Min Ho?

00:05:20.865 --> 00:05:23.194
Hey, you don't get to talk to me like that.

00:05:23.195 --> 00:05:25.205
I even went to prison for you.

00:05:25.305 --> 00:05:26.705
Are you broke?

00:05:32.675 --> 00:05:33.745
You want me to bury you too?

00:05:34.875 --> 00:05:35.875
Do you, Dong Hyeon?

00:05:36.445 --> 00:05:37.615
You want me to bury you too?

00:05:42.015 --> 00:05:43.415
Gosh!

00:05:44.225 --> 00:05:46.125
You think it's funny, messing around like this?

00:05:46.325 --> 00:05:47.895
No, it's not like that.

00:05:47.925 --> 00:05:50.425
I don't know what's going on with you,

00:05:50.795 --> 00:05:52.895
but you know I know Park Min Ho better than anyone.

00:05:53.425 --> 00:05:56.265
There's no way Min Ho can reach you. You know that.

00:05:57.065 --> 00:05:59.265
And even if something were to happen to you,

00:05:59.635 --> 00:06:01.335
I'll have your back, no matter what.

00:06:01.735 --> 00:06:05.175
You're my best friend. Right?

00:06:05.505 --> 00:06:06.945
So don't worry about it.

00:06:08.415 --> 00:06:09.615
I'm sorry, Seong Uk.

00:06:11.815 --> 00:06:13.285
I guess I just lost it for a second.

00:06:14.685 --> 00:06:16.455
Right. If you run out of money, give me a call,

00:06:17.115 --> 00:06:19.455
and just quit it with the stupid jokes.

00:06:21.995 --> 00:06:23.795
I have to prep for my match. You should go.

00:06:24.065 --> 00:06:26.725
All right. I'll be ready too.

00:06:27.195 --> 00:06:28.265
Yes. Now get lost.

00:06:29.935 --> 00:06:32.205
Right. Seong Uk said so himself.

00:06:33.605 --> 00:06:37.035
Then what kind of jerk is messing with me?

00:06:42.215 --> 00:06:45.785
He's Jo Seong Uk. He's the same age as Park Min Ho and Im Dong Hyeon.

00:06:46.245 --> 00:06:50.155
After college, he was a benchwarmer on a pro volleyball team,

00:06:50.215 --> 00:06:53.655
but he never made a name for himself before retiring a few years later.

00:06:53.725 --> 00:06:57.125
He had a poor record, but he became a college coach, which is tough.

00:06:57.195 --> 00:06:58.695
And he held that position for a long time.

00:06:59.025 --> 00:07:01.435
And without any formal coaching certifications too.

00:07:01.495 --> 00:07:03.935
Any family ties to the university's board?

00:07:04.365 --> 00:07:06.305
- Apparently not. - Figured as much.

00:07:07.335 --> 00:07:10.075
Mr. Park Dong Su still doesn't recognize you, does he, Mr. Jang?

00:07:11.645 --> 00:07:12.645
No.

00:07:13.475 --> 00:07:16.045
His moments of lucidity are getting shorter and shorter.

00:07:17.585 --> 00:07:19.285
It looks like, for the time being,

00:07:19.785 --> 00:07:21.255
I'm going to have to stay at the hospital.

00:07:21.455 --> 00:07:24.225
You're living at the hospital? That's a tough gig, you know.

00:07:24.285 --> 00:07:26.925
I'll go and focus on Dong Su,

00:07:27.185 --> 00:07:30.255
so I need Do Gi and the others to focus on those two.

00:07:30.965 --> 00:07:34.195
You never know. We might cross paths in an unexpected way.

00:07:34.835 --> 00:07:35.835
Understood.

00:07:36.395 --> 00:07:38.335
- Take care. - You too.

00:07:42.075 --> 00:07:46.445
But doesn't something seem off with Im Dong Hyeon and Jo Seong Uk?

00:07:46.505 --> 00:07:48.674
I thought so when they were talking.

00:07:48.675 --> 00:07:50.815
For friends, one's paying the other...

00:07:51.015 --> 00:07:52.185
and protecting the other.

00:07:53.845 --> 00:07:56.985
That's because Jo Seong Uk was probably the one...

00:07:57.355 --> 00:07:58.855
in the CCTV blind spot 15 years ago.

00:07:59.755 --> 00:08:00.755
Right?

00:08:01.495 --> 00:08:04.695
Yes, that must be it. So Im Dong Hyeon is threatening him...

00:08:04.765 --> 00:08:08.065
- and extorting money from him. - I think it's the other way around.

00:08:08.595 --> 00:08:10.704
Im Dong Hyeon may be getting the money,

00:08:10.705 --> 00:08:12.165
but he's the one being blackmailed.

00:08:12.305 --> 00:08:14.875
- What? - Okay.

00:08:15.535 --> 00:08:16.905
So, what's our first move?

00:08:20.045 --> 00:08:21.415
How about we start with some therapy?

00:08:21.745 --> 00:08:22.745
Therapy?

00:08:23.475 --> 00:08:24.585
Financial therapy.

00:08:25.615 --> 00:08:26.715
Financial therapy.

00:08:27.515 --> 00:08:28.515
Right.

00:08:29.185 --> 00:08:32.285
That Im Dong Hyeon guy is a serious gambling addict.

00:08:44.805 --> 00:08:47.065
(Condolence Money Envelope)

00:08:54.575 --> 00:08:55.615
Darn it.

00:08:57.485 --> 00:08:59.485
(Office)

00:09:02.915 --> 00:09:04.054
(We ask those without a death notice...)

00:09:04.055 --> 00:09:05.985
(to refrain from paying respects.)

00:09:10.425 --> 00:09:11.565
"Congratulations?"

00:09:12.195 --> 00:09:15.495
You're not supposed to use these envelopes at a funeral, are you?

00:09:15.635 --> 00:09:17.195
Driver Kim, you've played cards before, right?

00:09:17.265 --> 00:09:20.135
No. But with you, Go Eun, what's there to worry about?

00:09:21.135 --> 00:09:22.575
Sure. Just leave it to me.

00:09:24.605 --> 00:09:26.475
(Respectfully Offering a Chance to Bet)

00:09:33.345 --> 00:09:35.255
Wait, are those wreath messages for real?

00:09:35.515 --> 00:09:38.085
"Respectfully Offering a Bet."

00:09:38.325 --> 00:09:39.655
"A Romance in Probability?"

00:09:40.155 --> 00:09:41.625
They're really living it up.

00:09:57.805 --> 00:09:59.575
Driver Kim, it's 10,000 dollars.

00:10:03.915 --> 00:10:04.985
It's 10,000 dollars.

00:10:20.865 --> 00:10:23.065
(Played a Good Hand. Time to Go)

00:10:24.535 --> 00:10:25.735
(Commemorating a Life, Time to Bet Yours)

00:10:35.315 --> 00:10:36.345
Exchange it.

00:10:52.525 --> 00:10:54.065
(The Late Gwak Mu Seok)

00:10:56.735 --> 00:10:57.735
You scared me.

00:10:59.205 --> 00:11:01.805
You want to exchange 10,000 dollars, is that right?

00:11:04.005 --> 00:11:06.905
Yes, 10,000 dollars.

00:11:06.975 --> 00:11:09.875
You'll get your chips once you're inside.

00:11:11.385 --> 00:11:13.815
Hang on. Do I know you?

00:11:16.555 --> 00:11:18.955
Never mind. Cash, please.

00:11:19.025 --> 00:11:22.695
Who runs a money exchange like that? Seriously.

00:11:23.695 --> 00:11:24.695
Okay.

00:11:27.695 --> 00:11:30.165
Get out now! What kind of stunt are you pulling?

00:11:30.235 --> 00:11:31.405
Something wrong, sir?

00:11:31.835 --> 00:11:34.065
He snuck in with a hidden camera.

00:11:34.575 --> 00:11:35.834
- Darn it. - Come on.

00:11:35.835 --> 00:11:38.175
Do you really have to be so rigid?

00:11:38.345 --> 00:11:40.874
- What are you talking about? - Driver Kim.

00:11:40.875 --> 00:11:43.275
A camera detector is at the door.

00:11:43.715 --> 00:11:44.945
Get out of there for now.

00:11:46.145 --> 00:11:48.285
If I leave now, it'll just make me look more suspicious.

00:11:51.055 --> 00:11:53.055
So, are you exchanging money or not?

00:11:55.655 --> 00:11:57.525
Once you've exchanged your money, you can go in.

00:12:00.165 --> 00:12:02.135
Driver Kim, you'll be caught if you just go in.

00:12:06.735 --> 00:12:08.505
When I walk out of here a big winner,

00:12:08.875 --> 00:12:11.005
- I'll tip you. - What?

00:12:13.375 --> 00:12:16.675
Darn it, my money! Goodness.

00:12:17.075 --> 00:12:18.145
What's this?

00:12:18.685 --> 00:12:21.115
Gosh. Hold on.

00:12:22.015 --> 00:12:25.055
Are my ancestors telling me I'm going to lose it all?

00:12:25.555 --> 00:12:27.855
Darn, this is a bad omen.

00:12:30.965 --> 00:12:32.765
Darn it, he stepped on it.

00:12:33.065 --> 00:12:34.395
- Seriously. - What a load of nonsense.

00:12:34.465 --> 00:12:38.335
You can't just step on it! This is bad. It's a really bad omen!

00:12:38.405 --> 00:12:39.435
Darn it.

00:12:40.465 --> 00:12:41.605
Real smooth.

00:12:42.375 --> 00:12:44.175
This is a really bad omen.

00:12:44.705 --> 00:12:47.945
I'll go and pay my respects and come back.

00:12:50.245 --> 00:12:51.245
Hold on a second.

00:12:54.385 --> 00:12:55.685
You're going to take that with you, right?

00:12:57.985 --> 00:12:59.125
That's for your trouble.

00:12:59.685 --> 00:13:00.785
Give it to him.

00:13:01.325 --> 00:13:02.325
Me?

00:13:05.165 --> 00:13:06.525
Gosh. Just let him go.

00:13:13.165 --> 00:13:16.905
Without the cameras, we have no way of helping you from out here.

00:13:17.275 --> 00:13:20.345
That means you'll have to rely purely on your own skills, right?

00:13:20.605 --> 00:13:24.115
Come on, Driver Kim knows what to do. Right?

00:13:24.885 --> 00:13:25.985
When it comes to gambling,

00:13:26.985 --> 00:13:28.685
I can't do it without you, Go Eun.

00:13:28.815 --> 00:13:31.655
Goodness. There's something Driver Kim can't do?

00:13:32.585 --> 00:13:34.925
Is there really no other way?

00:13:35.895 --> 00:13:37.125
Wait.

00:13:40.895 --> 00:13:44.935
My entire past has been leading up to this very fateful day.

00:13:45.005 --> 00:13:46.205
How should I put this?

00:13:48.605 --> 00:13:49.605
What?

00:13:50.575 --> 00:13:51.675
Just have a seat.

00:13:52.245 --> 00:13:53.945
Geumnam-myeon, Hwacheon-gun, Gangwon Province.

00:13:54.175 --> 00:13:55.645
It's 1,160m above sea level.

00:13:56.045 --> 00:13:59.185
My old company's RnD center was located there.

00:13:59.245 --> 00:14:02.715
No buses or taxis, no houses nearby, and security wouldn't let us leave.

00:14:02.755 --> 00:14:04.014
For three years.

00:14:04.015 --> 00:14:06.455
- It was like the Arctic. - And?

00:14:06.485 --> 00:14:08.195
Anyone who went in there...

00:14:08.925 --> 00:14:12.265
came out as one of two things. Either a master of table tennis...

00:14:12.925 --> 00:14:14.295
or a master cardsharp.

00:14:15.195 --> 00:14:17.365
Because once work was done, there was nothing to do at night.

00:14:17.665 --> 00:14:19.065
So which one did you become?

00:14:19.335 --> 00:14:23.075
- Jin Eon, what hand would you like? - Me?

00:14:24.005 --> 00:14:26.005
- Gwangttaeng? - Gwangttaeng?

00:14:27.575 --> 00:14:30.075
No. I'll give you a bust.

00:14:30.675 --> 00:14:31.885
Like a two-eight bust?

00:14:32.915 --> 00:14:35.985
- Go Eun, what would you like? - Then I'll take the Gwangttaeng.

00:14:36.055 --> 00:14:40.025
Gwangttaeng is dealt, not chosen. You've never played Seotda, right?

00:14:40.225 --> 00:14:41.295
Gwang.

00:14:41.925 --> 00:14:42.955
Ttaeng.

00:14:45.595 --> 00:14:46.595
No way!

00:14:46.895 --> 00:14:49.694
I'll teach Driver Kim quickly, and then...

00:14:49.695 --> 00:14:50.735
No.

00:14:51.335 --> 00:14:52.705
This time, instead of me,

00:14:53.335 --> 00:14:54.775
I need you to go in, Chief Choi.

00:14:55.205 --> 00:14:56.205
Me?

00:15:00.945 --> 00:15:01.945
Why?

00:15:04.685 --> 00:15:05.715
Oh, boy.

00:15:38.885 --> 00:15:41.285
Call. And raise 400.

00:15:42.485 --> 00:15:44.584
I can't work alone. I need a partner.

00:15:44.585 --> 00:15:46.055
It's suspicious if I keep winning.

00:15:46.485 --> 00:15:47.755
I can help with that.

00:15:50.295 --> 00:15:51.365
- All in. - Call.

00:15:51.625 --> 00:15:55.065
All right, then. Call.

00:15:56.895 --> 00:15:57.905
A nine.

00:16:01.205 --> 00:16:02.535
Darn it.

00:16:05.305 --> 00:16:06.405
What on earth?

00:16:06.545 --> 00:16:08.445
What a shame. And you went all in too.

00:16:08.845 --> 00:16:12.915
Hey, I'll be back, so don't any of you go anywhere.

00:16:13.115 --> 00:16:15.385
Especially you. Don't you take the money and run.

00:16:16.285 --> 00:16:18.885
The important thing is, to everyone at that table,

00:16:19.125 --> 00:16:21.525
we have to make it absolutely clear we aren't together.

00:16:25.295 --> 00:16:30.464
Stay only by my side

00:16:30.465 --> 00:16:32.065
Please don't

00:16:33.235 --> 00:16:34.775
Leave

00:16:35.975 --> 00:16:37.505
What's your game of choice, sir?

00:16:37.975 --> 00:16:39.805
I hear the Seotda table is fun.

00:16:39.875 --> 00:16:43.315
Oh, you like Seotda? Right this way to the table.

00:16:47.615 --> 00:16:49.715
Excuse me, everyone.

00:16:50.785 --> 00:16:52.385
Let's have some fun, shall we?

00:16:53.085 --> 00:16:56.125
All right, everyone. Ready to lose your shirts?

00:16:56.225 --> 00:16:57.795
Hey, now, you can't be doing that.

00:16:59.695 --> 00:17:01.165
Do I know Do Gi?

00:17:03.465 --> 00:17:05.934
He was the best taxi driver ever...

00:17:05.935 --> 00:17:07.065
Gosh.

00:17:07.935 --> 00:17:09.675
Gosh, you scared me!

00:17:10.335 --> 00:17:11.975
Here to borrow some money for the tables?

00:17:13.605 --> 00:17:16.745
Yes. I lost it all.

00:17:17.075 --> 00:17:20.785
Driver Kim, your credit is good, so I'll waive the interest for you.

00:17:21.915 --> 00:17:22.915
Thank you.

00:17:23.415 --> 00:17:25.525
- Win big this time. - I will.

00:17:25.725 --> 00:17:26.785
Hey!

00:17:27.725 --> 00:17:30.195
Driver Kim! Why not have soup before you go?

00:17:30.225 --> 00:17:31.395
It must be awful to lose all that money.

00:17:31.465 --> 00:17:33.525
(Community Center)

00:17:33.625 --> 00:17:35.335
Score!

00:17:36.595 --> 00:17:38.035
For crying out loud!

00:17:39.405 --> 00:17:42.905
Deal me in, okay? I'll be right back.

00:17:45.075 --> 00:17:46.345
Hey, young man.

00:17:48.045 --> 00:17:50.775
- Play like a gentleman. - He has no manners.

00:17:51.785 --> 00:17:53.385
What gentleman? This is a card game.

00:17:54.215 --> 00:17:55.215
Go Eun.

00:17:56.455 --> 00:17:59.125
- What? - Hey, can you spot me five bucks?

00:17:59.255 --> 00:18:00.285
No.

00:18:00.355 --> 00:18:03.395
I saw you earlier. You gave Driver Kim a bag of cash.

00:18:03.525 --> 00:18:05.065
- You saw that? - Of course I did.

00:18:06.765 --> 00:18:07.795
Pay me back.

00:18:08.165 --> 00:18:11.165
Gosh, I don't play to win. I play for fun.

00:18:12.465 --> 00:18:14.365
The interest is 50 percent, okay?

00:18:14.575 --> 00:18:16.735
(Cup noodle combo, yukgaejang, pork cutlet combo)

00:18:19.275 --> 00:18:23.815
I wandered around and cried without knowing why

00:18:23.875 --> 00:18:25.385
Is there a particular game you'd like to play?

00:18:25.685 --> 00:18:29.355
- Seotda. - The Seotda table is full.

00:18:32.625 --> 00:18:33.625
All in.

00:18:34.525 --> 00:18:35.525
Pair of nines!

00:18:35.655 --> 00:18:37.924
Oh, dear. Would you look at that?

00:18:37.925 --> 00:18:40.265
I just happen to have the best hand.

00:18:41.865 --> 00:18:43.295
Oh, my goodness!

00:18:44.065 --> 00:18:45.065
Darn it!

00:18:46.165 --> 00:18:48.905
- Look. A seat just opened up. - Yes. Right this way to the table.

00:18:51.545 --> 00:18:52.545
Here you are, sir.

00:18:53.045 --> 00:18:56.245
Look who's back so soon. Did you get a loan from a loan shark?

00:18:56.615 --> 00:18:59.545
I'm playing for real this time, so you better watch out.

00:18:59.615 --> 00:19:01.685
And you weren't serious before?

00:19:02.085 --> 00:19:03.915
Come on, deal the cards already.

00:19:08.225 --> 00:19:11.225
Let's start the main event. No reason to drag this out.

00:19:11.265 --> 00:19:12.325
A pair of eights for you.

00:19:13.465 --> 00:19:14.635
And for Driver Kim, a pair of nines.

00:19:15.065 --> 00:19:17.065
This one's going straight to all in, you punk.

00:19:27.745 --> 00:19:28.745
Three thousand dollars.

00:19:35.155 --> 00:19:37.755
- Phone call for player nine. - Oh, that's me.

00:19:47.325 --> 00:19:48.335
Hey.

00:19:49.795 --> 00:19:51.565
No, I'm not gambling.

00:19:53.135 --> 00:19:54.705
Got it.

00:19:56.175 --> 00:19:58.145
Gosh, I didn't realize how late it is.

00:19:58.545 --> 00:19:59.905
I'm folding this hand.

00:20:01.075 --> 00:20:03.045
- Cashing out for the night? - Yes.

00:20:03.075 --> 00:20:05.915
- Why not stay for one more? - Could you cash these out for me?

00:20:06.245 --> 00:20:07.985
- Certainly. - Gosh.

00:20:14.055 --> 00:20:16.095
Gosh, what a terrible hand. I'm out.

00:20:17.255 --> 00:20:19.595
Man, today is just not my day.

00:20:19.965 --> 00:20:21.535
And I even said a prayer and everything.

00:20:22.035 --> 00:20:24.435
- I'll come back with a lucky charm. - I guess I will...

00:20:25.065 --> 00:20:29.035
Gosh, how much did you win?

00:20:29.875 --> 00:20:32.175
You'll be playing all night with that.

00:20:32.845 --> 00:20:34.975
- I'm so jealous. - What are you talking about?

00:20:35.045 --> 00:20:38.245
I'm coming back, so you'd better still be here playing.

00:20:39.445 --> 00:20:40.915
Can you cash me out too?

00:20:44.315 --> 00:20:48.795
Let's keep this party going! All night long.

00:21:02.635 --> 00:21:06.445
Seriously? I wondered where he went, and this is it? His gym?

00:21:06.575 --> 00:21:09.015
Maybe he's more serious about this business than I thought.

00:21:09.075 --> 00:21:10.475
Or maybe he's just here for a nap?

00:21:10.745 --> 00:21:13.185
He rushed over right after the call, quitting the game in the middle.

00:21:13.385 --> 00:21:16.415
That means he had something important to take care of.

00:21:17.685 --> 00:21:19.585
Something important?

00:21:30.465 --> 00:21:33.005
Unfortunately, there are no cameras in the owner's office.

00:21:33.635 --> 00:21:36.905
Then we won't know what kind of important, shady stuff he's up to.

00:21:37.005 --> 00:21:39.245
What do you mean? I can just go and see for myself.

00:21:39.645 --> 00:21:42.245
- You're going in, Go Eun? - Driver Kim can't.

00:21:42.515 --> 00:21:43.645
I'll pop in for a quick look.

00:21:44.145 --> 00:21:46.485
Hey, Driver Kim, Go Eun says she's going in.

00:21:46.785 --> 00:21:49.615
Like Go Eun said, it's not like I can go in there myself.

00:21:50.215 --> 00:21:52.125
- I've got a card game to play. - Hello.

00:21:52.185 --> 00:21:54.225
- Good to see you. Let's work out. - Hi, there.

00:21:54.355 --> 00:21:57.495
- Hello. - Hi.

00:21:57.555 --> 00:22:00.625
Welcome to "Find the Owner." Let's go find the owner.

00:22:00.695 --> 00:22:03.065
- The owner... - Ma'am, can I help you?

00:22:03.165 --> 00:22:04.235
Did you just call me "ma'am?"

00:22:04.905 --> 00:22:07.035
The name's Go-vely. I'm here to see the owner.

00:22:07.065 --> 00:22:09.835
- The owner isn't here right now. - What? He went out again?

00:22:09.905 --> 00:22:13.775
No, he's in his office. But he said he's not to be disturbed.

00:22:13.845 --> 00:22:17.745
Okay. The "not to be disturbed" guy. I think I'll go meet him right now.

00:22:17.815 --> 00:22:20.615
If you'd like to leave a message, I can give it to him later.

00:22:20.685 --> 00:22:22.985
It's not the kind of message I can leave. I'll tell him myself.

00:22:23.055 --> 00:22:24.785
Gosh, what's so important that you can't just leave a message?

00:22:24.855 --> 00:22:26.855
Today, I will meet the owner and finally...

00:22:27.085 --> 00:22:28.795
- Hey! Stop... - Excuse me.

00:22:28.855 --> 00:22:30.925
- This is the owner's office. - For crying out loud...

00:22:30.995 --> 00:22:34.265
- It's locked, you can't get in. - We'll see about that...

00:22:34.495 --> 00:22:36.495
What? It was unlocked?

00:22:36.595 --> 00:22:38.465
How strange. I could've sworn it was locked.

00:22:38.535 --> 00:22:39.535
Hey, come on, quick!

00:22:39.965 --> 00:22:41.575
Let's see what an owner's office looks like...

00:22:41.635 --> 00:22:42.635
- I'll get in trouble. - when he's gone.

00:22:42.805 --> 00:22:45.004
- You can't go in. - I'll take a quick look.

00:22:45.005 --> 00:22:46.504
- Please don't. - Gosh, this office is...

00:22:46.505 --> 00:22:47.775
- Seriously. - The owner...

00:22:48.005 --> 00:22:50.775
- Look, he's not even in there. - Goodness.

00:22:50.915 --> 00:22:51.945
- What? - What?

00:22:52.245 --> 00:22:55.355
- I'm serious. No one was there. - You startled me!

00:22:56.455 --> 00:22:58.325
What's going on? Why is it so loud out here?

00:22:58.555 --> 00:23:02.155
A woman insisted she had to see you. She said it couldn't be a message.

00:23:03.395 --> 00:23:04.395
Do I know you?

00:23:05.925 --> 00:23:06.995
No.

00:23:08.495 --> 00:23:10.795
He is the owner?

00:23:11.195 --> 00:23:12.205
Yes.

00:23:12.865 --> 00:23:15.775
That's right, I'm the owner here. So, what's this urgent business?

00:23:16.075 --> 00:23:17.805
He isn't the owner I was looking for.

00:23:19.005 --> 00:23:22.415
The owner I'm looking for is handsome with delicate features.

00:23:22.745 --> 00:23:24.945
Who is this old guy? Oh, my goodness. No way.

00:23:25.085 --> 00:23:26.485
I guess I'm in the wrong place.

00:23:28.015 --> 00:23:30.615
Then where in the world could the owner I'm looking for be?

00:23:30.985 --> 00:23:34.785
Ugh, I need to find that guy. But this isn't it.

00:23:35.255 --> 00:23:36.795
Hey, did you guys get any of that?

00:23:37.255 --> 00:23:38.265
Not really.

00:23:38.595 --> 00:23:40.095
She didn't smell like she'd been drinking, though.

00:23:40.795 --> 00:23:43.695
Seriously, where is the owner?

00:23:45.405 --> 00:23:46.605
Driver Kim, did you see that?

00:23:46.935 --> 00:23:48.675
He definitely wasn't in the owner's office.

00:23:49.405 --> 00:23:50.974
I saw it too. He definitely wasn't there.

00:23:50.975 --> 00:23:52.745
So what he chose over gambling...

00:23:53.075 --> 00:23:55.545
must be something he can't risk anyone seeing.

00:24:09.255 --> 00:24:12.725
Everything tastes so good when my son makes it.

00:24:15.135 --> 00:24:16.535
You're the one who made all of this, Dad.

00:24:17.335 --> 00:24:18.865
All I did was plate it.

00:24:22.075 --> 00:24:23.835
I got another offer from a pro team today.

00:24:24.235 --> 00:24:25.645
You did? I see.

00:24:26.605 --> 00:24:30.245
If all goes well, I'll probably have a team lined up before I graduate.

00:24:30.315 --> 00:24:31.315
Gosh.

00:24:31.575 --> 00:24:34.245
All that hard work is finally paying off.

00:24:34.585 --> 00:24:36.885
It's going to be smooth sailing from here on out, right?

00:24:38.755 --> 00:24:40.185
Once I get my bonus after joining the team,

00:24:40.385 --> 00:24:43.025
how about renovating this shop first?

00:24:43.125 --> 00:24:45.565
No. Don't you worry about me.

00:24:46.265 --> 00:24:48.095
You just focus on saving your money from now on.

00:24:48.695 --> 00:24:50.835
I heard that for athletes,

00:24:51.565 --> 00:24:53.565
it's really important to be good at saving.

00:24:54.365 --> 00:24:56.335
This is so good. Goodness.

00:24:59.845 --> 00:25:00.875
I'm going to head out.

00:25:04.815 --> 00:25:05.815
Hey!

00:25:06.385 --> 00:25:07.445
Wait, we're having such a nice time...

00:25:08.585 --> 00:25:09.815
You haven't even touched your food.

00:25:10.315 --> 00:25:13.525
Wait a minute, Min Ho! Where are you going?

00:25:13.685 --> 00:25:15.125
You should at least eat something before you go.

00:25:15.425 --> 00:25:16.425
Min Ho.

00:25:33.205 --> 00:25:36.175
Dad, you have to come right now. Hurry.

00:25:36.715 --> 00:25:37.715
Min Ho.

00:26:27.895 --> 00:26:29.865
I should be able to see it,

00:26:31.565 --> 00:26:33.035
but I can't.

00:27:17.845 --> 00:27:19.085
You're awake?

00:27:19.745 --> 00:27:21.745
You still need to do your walking rehab.

00:27:23.115 --> 00:27:24.555
We need you to walk a little.

00:28:04.595 --> 00:28:06.795
Min Ho...

00:28:52.075 --> 00:28:53.075
Gosh.

00:28:55.075 --> 00:28:56.515
I wonder if he's in the playroom.

00:29:01.345 --> 00:29:03.555
There you are. Why didn't you come out?

00:29:05.155 --> 00:29:08.285
Gosh, why are you always sleeping in my bed?

00:29:11.325 --> 00:29:12.825
Dong Su!

00:29:14.265 --> 00:29:17.995
No! Help! Can we get a doctor over here, please?

00:29:18.395 --> 00:29:19.935
What is this?

00:29:22.705 --> 00:29:24.705
Dong Su!

00:29:25.375 --> 00:29:26.545
Doctor!

00:29:28.945 --> 00:29:32.185
Actually, this isn't the first time.

00:29:32.945 --> 00:29:36.455
Last time, he also self-harmed right after waking up.

00:29:39.355 --> 00:29:40.985
Even after he opens his eyes,

00:29:41.625 --> 00:29:44.495
it's like he's still trapped in his dream.

00:29:48.125 --> 00:29:49.835
(New Spring Nursing Home)

00:30:23.195 --> 00:30:26.735
"My moments of lucidity are getting shorter."

00:30:27.705 --> 00:30:30.435
"And they last under three minutes."

00:30:32.745 --> 00:30:35.715
I'm leaving the things I must remember and never forget.

00:30:36.475 --> 00:30:38.545
I'm leaving them here.

00:30:49.525 --> 00:30:50.595
My son...

00:30:51.555 --> 00:30:53.965
is on the Jingwang University volleyball team. He's number ten.

00:30:54.325 --> 00:30:55.335
Park Min Ho.

00:30:59.235 --> 00:31:00.235
Min Ho...

00:31:00.935 --> 00:31:02.935
loved Girls' Generation,

00:31:04.735 --> 00:31:08.645
and his favorite food was the veggie bibimbap I made for him.

00:31:09.745 --> 00:31:14.185
- This is so good. - Min Ho loved taking pictures.

00:31:15.085 --> 00:31:17.255
- Look. - That's a great shot.

00:31:17.315 --> 00:31:18.315
It's a great shot.

00:31:19.625 --> 00:31:21.885
Gosh. Dad.

00:31:22.395 --> 00:31:25.595
Today, the whole sky looks like a volleyball court.

00:31:25.895 --> 00:31:27.165
It's so beautiful.

00:31:28.365 --> 00:31:30.565
- It really is beautiful. - We should come here more often.

00:31:33.735 --> 00:31:34.735
Min Ho...

00:31:36.035 --> 00:31:40.005
said he loved the orange of the sunset.

00:31:40.775 --> 00:31:44.075
Dad, I got MVP! Pretty great, right? What?

00:31:45.115 --> 00:31:46.415
Hey, louder!

00:31:49.315 --> 00:31:50.315
The lights.

00:31:50.515 --> 00:31:51.515
(Dad, you have to come right now. Hurry.)

00:31:51.516 --> 00:31:52.525
Min Ho's text.

00:31:53.085 --> 00:31:54.085
"Come right now. Hurry."

00:31:54.685 --> 00:31:55.755
A big truck.

00:31:57.295 --> 00:31:58.355
Onto the sidewalk.

00:32:19.515 --> 00:32:21.745
I'm sorry I couldn't find you.

00:32:24.585 --> 00:32:27.655
And I'm sorry I can't remember.

00:33:06.865 --> 00:33:08.865
(All in Gym)

00:33:13.165 --> 00:33:15.065
Looks like he was in there for exactly five hours.

00:33:15.475 --> 00:33:17.835
But even if Im Dong Hyeon leaves, how do we get in?

00:33:17.905 --> 00:33:19.245
It's open 24-7,

00:33:19.305 --> 00:33:21.275
so it looks like there are always staff and customers in there.

00:33:32.225 --> 00:33:33.255
I guess there's no other way.

00:33:34.085 --> 00:33:35.455
We might as well just buy the gym.

00:33:35.695 --> 00:33:37.625
What? You're going to buy the gym?

00:33:40.895 --> 00:33:41.895
Darn it!

00:33:42.595 --> 00:33:45.235
Darn that taxi!

00:33:47.465 --> 00:33:48.465
Pair of threes.

00:34:05.625 --> 00:34:07.485
All right, time to focus.

00:34:10.925 --> 00:34:13.195
- Are you all right? - Driver Kim...

00:34:15.165 --> 00:34:16.665
You're the guy who went all-in earlier.

00:34:17.665 --> 00:34:18.665
You look tired.

00:34:19.635 --> 00:34:21.435
I was, but I'm wide awake now.

00:34:21.935 --> 00:34:23.235
Gosh, you brought a lot of cash.

00:34:23.775 --> 00:34:26.445
Yes. Go big or go home.

00:34:27.075 --> 00:34:28.345
I'm here for a real showdown.

00:34:34.745 --> 00:34:36.255
A showdown. I like it.

00:34:48.165 --> 00:34:50.664
It's the guy who won my money and ran away.

00:34:50.665 --> 00:34:52.605
It's called skill.

00:34:53.565 --> 00:34:56.135
- Shouldn't you be in school? - Ye, school.

00:35:11.615 --> 00:35:13.185
Aren't you going to look at your cards?

00:35:13.355 --> 00:35:17.595
I wondered why I always lost against you.

00:35:18.095 --> 00:35:19.095
And then it hit me.

00:35:20.265 --> 00:35:22.095
You've been reading my tells.

00:35:23.035 --> 00:35:24.365
That's why I kept losing.

00:35:24.695 --> 00:35:26.805
Like I said, it's a difference in skill.

00:35:28.705 --> 00:35:29.705
Betting 10,000.

00:35:31.075 --> 00:35:32.805
You're betting without even looking at your hand?

00:35:35.175 --> 00:35:37.575
- I'm out. - I'll fold too.

00:35:42.355 --> 00:35:45.515
- A lousy three. I'm out. - Looks like everyone's folding.

00:35:47.355 --> 00:35:49.125
Gosh, this method works really well.

00:35:49.895 --> 00:35:51.925
Deal them. All right, hold on.

00:35:52.025 --> 00:35:53.325
Let's see what I had.

00:35:54.565 --> 00:35:58.465
What? Only one point! Darn it, and I folded with a five.

00:36:00.005 --> 00:36:01.005
That's how it's done.

00:36:01.365 --> 00:36:04.375
Hey, pal. I'll even go to school for him,

00:36:04.505 --> 00:36:05.535
so just shuffle them up good for me.

00:36:06.075 --> 00:36:07.075
Gosh.

00:36:14.915 --> 00:36:17.385
All right. Dealing.

00:36:22.285 --> 00:36:23.295
I bet 30,000.

00:36:26.365 --> 00:36:27.565
For crying out loud.

00:36:29.435 --> 00:36:31.335
- What? - I call 30,000.

00:36:32.505 --> 00:36:36.535
You've got a weird way of playing. Darn it, I fold.

00:36:36.975 --> 00:36:39.875
Okay, I have five points. So, what have you got?

00:36:42.375 --> 00:36:45.145
Dum-dee-dum, dum-dee-dum.

00:36:46.285 --> 00:36:47.685
- Six points! - Yes!

00:36:47.815 --> 00:36:49.685
Yes! I won again!

00:36:54.285 --> 00:36:56.455
Gosh, this is too good.

00:36:56.995 --> 00:37:00.565
Hey, I'm going all-in this time,

00:37:00.895 --> 00:37:03.695
so shuffle me up a real winner.

00:37:04.395 --> 00:37:07.005
If I could control the cards, you think I'd still be sitting here?

00:37:14.775 --> 00:37:18.845
Thank you very much. All right, I'm going big.

00:37:26.185 --> 00:37:28.355
I'm not looking at my cards this time either.

00:37:29.455 --> 00:37:31.625
Let's make it a big one. A hundred.

00:37:33.025 --> 00:37:34.265
A hundred? You mean 100,000 dollars?

00:37:34.565 --> 00:37:37.565
Gosh, that's too rich for my blood. I'm out.

00:37:38.735 --> 00:37:39.935
And that's one down.

00:37:53.685 --> 00:37:56.155
From the look on your face, you're about to fold.

00:37:57.685 --> 00:38:02.185
You think you can scare me just by betting blind?

00:38:02.625 --> 00:38:03.995
You look pretty scared to me.

00:38:05.965 --> 00:38:06.965
I'll see your 100...

00:38:08.065 --> 00:38:09.065
and raise you another 100.

00:38:10.565 --> 00:38:11.595
I fold.

00:38:12.735 --> 00:38:14.365
So that's how you want to play it?

00:38:15.805 --> 00:38:18.035
Should I just call?

00:38:24.075 --> 00:38:25.075
All in.

00:38:27.845 --> 00:38:29.755
Call it if you've got the guts.

00:38:31.555 --> 00:38:34.525
There's one thing all bad gamblers have in common.

00:38:34.925 --> 00:38:37.495
They think they can scare people just by throwing money around.

00:38:38.455 --> 00:38:39.465
Scare tactics?

00:38:40.625 --> 00:38:42.165
Can I put what's in my pocket on the table?

00:38:42.735 --> 00:38:43.735
Can I?

00:38:45.265 --> 00:38:46.265
Here.

00:38:48.165 --> 00:38:50.235
So you'll take collateral, will you?

00:38:50.805 --> 00:38:53.645
Not just any collateral. Do you know how much is at stake?

00:38:58.045 --> 00:38:59.075
The gym.

00:39:01.115 --> 00:39:02.285
The gym. Call?

00:39:03.655 --> 00:39:07.525
- It's okay to admit you're scared. - Scared?

00:39:11.055 --> 00:39:12.295
Write up a contract, and you've got a call.

00:39:14.065 --> 00:39:15.995
You thought that would make me fold, didn't you?

00:39:16.295 --> 00:39:18.465
You'll live to regret this.

00:39:18.895 --> 00:39:21.865
Hey! Get me some paper and a pen over here!

00:39:35.415 --> 00:39:38.215
(Collateral Agreement)

00:39:44.995 --> 00:39:46.725
(Jangttaeng)

00:39:49.195 --> 00:39:50.895
It's jangttaeng, the highest pair!

00:39:54.265 --> 00:39:55.265
Jangttaeng!

00:39:56.335 --> 00:39:59.745
No, wait. If that's jangttaeng,

00:40:00.145 --> 00:40:01.645
then what could possibly beat it?

00:40:02.445 --> 00:40:04.845
Only gwangttaeng, a royal pair.

00:40:04.915 --> 00:40:07.845
So, why did you try to pull a stunt like that on me?

00:40:09.715 --> 00:40:13.625
Wait. If I have gwangttaeng,

00:40:13.685 --> 00:40:14.825
I take it all, right?

00:40:15.755 --> 00:40:16.895
Hang on. Just hold on.

00:40:19.155 --> 00:40:20.325
Hold on.

00:40:20.865 --> 00:40:21.895
Here we go.

00:40:36.145 --> 00:40:37.145
(Gwangttaeng)

00:40:37.245 --> 00:40:39.945
Oh, my gosh! It's gwangttaeng!

00:40:40.345 --> 00:40:44.315
That's beautiful! A masterpiece!

00:40:46.785 --> 00:40:48.585
It's a work of art! Truly!

00:40:48.885 --> 00:40:50.225
My ancestors!

00:40:50.855 --> 00:40:53.495
I'll make an offering to you every single day.

00:40:53.565 --> 00:40:56.965
Just tell me what you're craving.

00:40:57.065 --> 00:40:58.465
Oh, ancestors!

00:41:00.635 --> 00:41:01.665
It's all mine!

00:41:01.865 --> 00:41:04.474
You jerks. Now I see.

00:41:04.475 --> 00:41:06.274
You guys set me up, didn't you?

00:41:06.275 --> 00:41:08.575
- What? - What's this about colluding?

00:41:08.875 --> 00:41:12.615
Sang Jun! Hyeon Su! These jerks here are cheaters!

00:41:13.815 --> 00:41:16.955
See? I knew it was suspicious when randoms started taking turns!

00:41:19.555 --> 00:41:21.025
Please stand up for a moment.

00:41:22.725 --> 00:41:23.955
We're going to have to search you.

00:41:25.195 --> 00:41:26.525
Unbelievable.

00:41:27.525 --> 00:41:29.065
I wouldn't touch me if I were you.

00:41:31.035 --> 00:41:32.535

00:54:20.505 --> 00:54:21.505
Dong Su.

00:54:23.235 --> 00:54:24.575
You went through so much.

00:54:27.375 --> 00:54:29.275
I'll take it from here.

00:54:56.335 --> 00:54:59.235
Looks like he came out after exactly five hours again.

00:55:29.205 --> 00:55:30.635
But there's a lock on it.

00:55:31.205 --> 00:55:34.075
And that's the only part obscured on our CCTV.

00:55:37.075 --> 00:55:38.075
Hold on.

00:55:54.425 --> 00:55:56.495
Three, five, seven, nine.

00:55:57.295 --> 00:55:59.835

The one thing important enough to make him stop gambling...

00:57:20.785 --> 00:57:22.085
was just more gambling.

So Im Dong Hyeon was here five hours doing online sports betting?

00:57:29.955 --> 00:57:32.455
No. To be exact,

00:57:33.025 --> 00:57:35.265
Im Dong Hyeon wasn't betting on sports.

00:57:35.865 --> 00:57:36.895

Yes.

With Jo Seong Uk, who's at the match.

00:58:28.645 --> 00:58:30.245
So what Dong Su figured out...

00:58:32.255 --> 00:58:33.285
was this all along.

What are you doing, you jerk?
