SURELY TOMORROW

00:00:47.152 --> 00:00:47.987
DONGWOON DAILY

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:49.530
A MONTH LATER

00:00:49.613 --> 00:00:50.906
I didn't know.

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:52.992
Oh, you didn't know?

00:00:53.742 --> 00:00:54.743
Look.

00:00:54.827 --> 00:00:58.914
It's been over a month
since Seo's divorce article was released.

00:00:58.998 --> 00:01:00.708
Why are you bringing this up again?

00:01:00.791 --> 00:01:03.168
I know. It was released a month ago…

00:01:03.252 --> 00:01:05.921
by Jogyeong Daily's Entertainment Team
across the street.

00:01:06.005 --> 00:01:07.506
-Right?
-Yes.

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.176
That article wasn't a hit
like it is right now.

00:01:12.511 --> 00:01:15.264
Are they trying to scout you
by any chance?

00:01:15.347 --> 00:01:17.349
What? Oh, no way.

00:01:17.433 --> 00:01:20.895
Then why are their number
of views so explosively high…

00:01:20.978 --> 00:01:24.064
Dongwoon Daily's Entertainment Team
Assistant Manager Lee Kyeong-do?

00:01:24.148 --> 00:01:26.066
That article has nothing to do with me.

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:27.818
Nothing?

00:01:27.902 --> 00:01:29.403
Did you just say that?

00:01:32.114 --> 00:01:34.450
HER DIVORCE, WAS THERE ANOTHER REASON?

00:01:36.118 --> 00:01:40.748
This cafe here.
It's the one nearby, right? Huh?

00:01:40.831 --> 00:01:43.542
This is where you went on
about quitting your job

00:01:43.626 --> 00:01:45.044
after I yelled at you once.

00:01:45.711 --> 00:01:47.129
Is it?

00:01:48.964 --> 00:01:51.342
Even though it's blurred,
it's clearly you.

00:01:52.343 --> 00:01:54.929
We all know that it's you.
Right, Lee Kyeong-do?

00:01:55.012 --> 00:01:58.432
Wait, don't call me by my name.
We're at work…

00:02:02.478 --> 00:02:04.063
Okay, Assistant Manager Lee.

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:08.150
Okay, fine, Assistant Manager Lee.
Gosh, this is so annoying.

00:02:08.233 --> 00:02:11.862
Hey! Will you look out there? Huh?

00:02:11.946 --> 00:02:15.616
Your juniors are working their asses off
to find an exclusive today, but look...

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:17.159
Their assistant manager son of a…

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.329
Their assistant manager idiot is…

00:02:20.412 --> 00:02:24.458
He provided articles for other media.
Look at this number of views, will you?

00:02:24.541 --> 00:02:26.043
It's not about me.
It's about Seo Ji-woo.

00:02:27.044 --> 00:02:28.879
Are you kidding me right now?

00:02:28.963 --> 00:02:30.255
I'm sorry.

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:35.052
Did you really not hear from her
about her divorce

00:02:35.135 --> 00:02:36.845
when this picture was taken?

00:02:36.929 --> 00:02:39.056
-No.
-I'm serious.

00:02:39.139 --> 00:02:42.184
I seriously didn't know.

00:02:46.063 --> 00:02:47.147
Man, seriously.

00:02:49.316 --> 00:02:53.612
If you're not busy,
help me pack, you jerk.

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:55.739
What? Are you traveling?

00:02:57.574 --> 00:03:00.244
It's no point. It's no point, you see?

00:03:00.327 --> 00:03:04.248
There's no point
in devoting my entire life to work.

00:03:04.331 --> 00:03:07.209
No point in buying all my juniors food!
There's no point!

00:03:07.292 --> 00:03:08.627
Jeez, what's the point?

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.297
What are you doing?

00:03:12.381 --> 00:03:13.716
I'm packing because I'm quitting.

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:17.136
Oh, if you have time,
pack my stuff in my cabinet for me.

00:03:17.219 --> 00:03:19.430
Why are you putting on a show
all of a sudden?

00:03:19.513 --> 00:03:23.559
A show?
You think this situation is a joke?

00:03:23.642 --> 00:03:25.894
I'm about to remove my desk
because of you.

00:03:25.978 --> 00:03:29.898
You can go to Chicago for training,
and I can go home.

00:03:29.982 --> 00:03:32.443
What do you think
of this ridiculous situation?

00:03:33.944 --> 00:03:38.198
I'm tearing up, seriously.
Goddamn it, this is pissing me off.

00:03:42.327 --> 00:03:47.124
Gosh, they were paid to do this,
but this picture is…

00:03:48.834 --> 00:03:51.128
They couldn't capture Ji-woo's beauty.

00:03:54.465 --> 00:03:55.716
Come in.

00:04:02.723 --> 00:04:04.600
Don't we need to get rid
of the articles on Ji-woo?

00:04:04.683 --> 00:04:07.770
What for? What does that
have to do with the company?

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:09.480
Who's that man?

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:12.274
Why?

00:04:12.357 --> 00:04:13.984
I mean,

00:04:14.068 --> 00:04:17.321
it's a scandal right after
all that trouble to get divorced.

00:04:17.404 --> 00:04:18.864
It's not irrelevant to the company.

00:04:18.947 --> 00:04:20.449
What does it have to do with the company?

00:04:21.533 --> 00:04:27.039
Look. When she got caught in those photos
with kids doing weed at the club…

00:04:27.122 --> 00:04:29.792
it left a bad impression on the company.
You know that.

00:04:30.918 --> 00:04:32.544
But Ji-woo didn't do weed.

00:04:33.754 --> 00:04:38.675
Ji-yeon, do you think
people care about the facts?

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:40.260
Before that…

00:04:43.597 --> 00:04:48.477
About Jin-eon.
No, now that they're divorced…

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:51.855
That man, Jin-eon.
I know that report was your doing.

00:04:52.606 --> 00:04:53.440
Me?

00:04:53.524 --> 00:04:56.777
It must've been hard for you as well,
watching how Ji-woo turned out.

00:04:58.529 --> 00:05:00.030
What are you talking about?

00:05:01.198 --> 00:05:03.575
Or did I not hear that right?

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:06.829
Anyway, thanks to you,
Ji-woo was able to settle it.

00:05:09.164 --> 00:05:13.085
Should I say
it's all thanks to An Da-hye then?

00:05:20.175 --> 00:05:24.847
What a pop star.
You're Dongwoon Daily's celeb now.

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:27.391
If I buy you coffee, will you shut up?

00:05:27.474 --> 00:05:28.475
Yes.

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:31.270
Hey, turn around. Just do it.

00:05:31.353 --> 00:05:32.271
-Why?
-Turn.

00:05:32.354 --> 00:05:33.355
Are you getting married?

00:05:33.981 --> 00:05:36.275
That asshole, shit…

00:05:36.358 --> 00:05:38.318
-Hello.
-Oh, hi.

00:05:40.571 --> 00:05:42.823
Hey, be honest with me, Kyeong-do, yeah?

00:05:42.906 --> 00:05:44.908
Is Seo Ji-woo following you to Chicago?

00:05:45.492 --> 00:05:47.953
Your Chicago training
was all planned, right?

00:05:48.036 --> 00:05:49.705
Stop the nonsense. Watch the economy.

00:05:49.788 --> 00:05:52.332
I'm just curious
about JARIM Apparel's future.

00:05:52.416 --> 00:05:54.376
As an economics journalist.

00:05:54.459 --> 00:05:55.919
This asshole…

00:05:56.003 --> 00:05:58.547
Hey, then did you plan this out
with Doo-jin?

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:01.508
You got Seo Ji-woo to divorce first,
so when she became single, you--

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:05.387
Just pay me back what you owe, asshole.

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:06.847
Gosh, hey. You kicked me too hard.

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:09.558
Why blame him? Reflect on yourself.

00:06:09.641 --> 00:06:11.518
Hit a jackpot or step in dung?
A thin line--

00:06:11.602 --> 00:06:14.605
Want me write an article?
"Kim Doo-jin on a date with female idol--"

00:06:14.688 --> 00:06:16.356
Kyeong-do!

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:19.860
The coffee's on me. We broke up last week.

00:06:19.943 --> 00:06:21.486
-Be good.
-Yes!

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:25.032
Wait, you haven't had lunch yet?

00:06:26.575 --> 00:06:28.911
Your brother-in-law wanted
to eat together. So I didn't eat.

00:06:30.287 --> 00:06:33.498
If your relationship is that bad,
divorce like me.

00:06:33.582 --> 00:06:36.877
It doesn't look good
for both sisters to get divorced.

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:39.796
Neither of us met a good husband, right?

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:44.801
MOM

00:06:51.558 --> 00:06:52.559
Yes, Mom.

00:06:52.643 --> 00:06:57.189
She never spends a day in peace.
Who's that man in the picture?

00:06:57.272 --> 00:07:01.401
Mom, Ji-woo is old enough
not to explain every guy she meets.

00:07:01.485 --> 00:07:03.487
It's not a big deal,
so you should go work out.

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:06.365
Don't call Ji-woo. Bye.

00:07:13.789 --> 00:07:16.959
I'm not a celebrity.
Why are they taking that kind of picture?

00:07:17.042 --> 00:07:19.628
I really don't get it. Do you?

00:07:21.838 --> 00:07:23.382
You are a celeb.

00:07:23.966 --> 00:07:26.468
People always comment
on the price and brand of what you wear.

00:07:27.302 --> 00:07:29.221
You should become an ambassador.

00:07:29.304 --> 00:07:32.599
I'd better leave soon. This is so hectic.

00:07:32.683 --> 00:07:36.270
What did he say? The man in the picture.
Is his name Lee Kyeong-do?

00:07:36.353 --> 00:07:38.689
He's probably complaining
that he stepped on poo.

00:07:38.772 --> 00:07:40.107
Why did you meet him?

00:07:40.857 --> 00:07:44.528
I just met him for no reason.
About the article and…

00:07:44.611 --> 00:07:47.614
Hey, Kyeong-do's information
has all been released.

00:07:47.698 --> 00:07:49.074
You can't run away alone.

00:07:50.534 --> 00:07:52.160
I bet he's not affected by that.

00:07:55.205 --> 00:07:56.915
He said he'd meet me
at one of our funerals.

00:07:58.208 --> 00:08:02.004
Then the one who puts the incense in first
wins or loses?

00:08:03.088 --> 00:08:06.466
You guys are so brutal even after aging.

00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:07.718
He never grows up.

00:08:10.137 --> 00:08:13.015
What's the point of going to England, huh?

00:08:13.098 --> 00:08:17.394
Now that you're divorced,
let's work out together, go on a trip…

00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:20.230
and learn the ropes here.

00:08:20.314 --> 00:08:22.733
I'm going so you won't make me work.

00:08:22.816 --> 00:08:25.068
Should I say...
I'm just sick of everything?

00:08:25.152 --> 00:08:29.990
Go only after assessing the situation.
What did Kyeong-do do wrong?

00:08:30.073 --> 00:08:32.367
He might die single because of you.

00:08:32.451 --> 00:08:35.287
What's wrong with you?
Just go if you're done.

00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:36.913
I'm not done eating yet.

00:08:37.706 --> 00:08:40.459
Anyway, isn't this delicious?

00:08:40.542 --> 00:08:41.960
Good job.

00:08:44.004 --> 00:08:46.923
Who else would say that?
It was Deaconess Lee.

00:08:47.007 --> 00:08:50.510
She's the neighborhood trumpet player.
She knows everything.

00:08:50.594 --> 00:08:53.221
Once she hears it, she won't let it slide.

00:08:53.305 --> 00:08:55.932
She'll tell everyone.

00:08:56.016 --> 00:08:57.934
She's just a friend. An old friend.

00:08:58.727 --> 00:09:00.520
I was happy for nothing.

00:09:00.604 --> 00:09:03.607
What do you mean
you were happy for nothing?

00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:05.359
Laundry delivery!

00:09:08.445 --> 00:09:09.863
It's 12,000 won.

00:09:09.946 --> 00:09:12.824
I'll pay you on my way to work tomorrow.
Must prep dinner.

00:09:12.908 --> 00:09:14.451
Oh, sure, sure. Go ahead.

00:09:14.534 --> 00:09:15.660
Please come again.

00:09:17.371 --> 00:09:19.831
I heard she's the daughter
of a big corporation.

00:09:19.915 --> 00:09:21.792
I thought you were marrying
into a rich family.

00:09:22.834 --> 00:09:27.589
Mom, why are you so materialistic
when you're a deaconess?

00:09:27.672 --> 00:09:31.385
Because I'm materialistic,
I haven't become a senior deaconess yet.

00:09:31.468 --> 00:09:32.761
Oh, Lord.

00:09:35.389 --> 00:09:39.309
I know you'll take care of yourself,
but don't make me pray for more. I'm busy.

00:09:39.393 --> 00:09:43.772
It's not a big deal.
My company published an article about her.

00:09:43.855 --> 00:09:46.108
She was upset about it.
Don't worry about it.

00:09:49.277 --> 00:09:50.737
Laundry delivery!

00:10:01.832 --> 00:10:03.208
Oh, gosh, oh…

00:10:04.709 --> 00:10:06.962
Damn it, Seo Ji-woo, shit…

00:10:08.672 --> 00:10:09.673
Seo Ji-woo!

00:10:13.593 --> 00:10:14.886
Oh, my ankle…

00:10:29.734 --> 00:10:33.655
You're going to Chicago for training.
Why do you care?

00:10:33.738 --> 00:10:35.615
Even if I go, I can't go like this.

00:10:35.699 --> 00:10:37.701
I'll be labeled for the rest of my life.

00:10:37.784 --> 00:10:41.204
Work's bad too.
Feels like everyone's whispering about me.

00:10:41.288 --> 00:10:42.706
Anyway, it's not nice.

00:10:43.373 --> 00:10:45.834
It's only for a little while.
No one cares about you.

00:10:45.917 --> 00:10:49.629
It even scratched my mom's social life.
My mom was shocked again.

00:10:49.713 --> 00:10:54.384
Anyway, Ji-woo can fly off to England
or whatever, but what about me?

00:10:54.468 --> 00:10:56.428
I'm just an ordinary, peaceful citizen.

00:10:56.511 --> 00:10:57.721
So what are you going to do?

00:10:58.555 --> 00:11:02.100
I've thought about it.

00:11:08.148 --> 00:11:11.902
It's not exactly a bad idea, right?

00:11:14.654 --> 00:11:15.739
Why should I do that?

00:11:15.822 --> 00:11:19.075
Well, just a reunion after a long time?

00:11:19.159 --> 00:11:20.827
Consider it something like that.

00:11:20.911 --> 00:11:24.289
We all meet up for a cup of tea
and post a commemorative photo.

00:11:26.374 --> 00:11:29.211
And it seems
Kyeong-do's in an awkward situation.

00:11:30.754 --> 00:11:34.049
You know what's funny?
Why are you saying this to me?

00:11:35.717 --> 00:11:36.551
What?

00:11:36.635 --> 00:11:38.803
He needs it, so why make you say it?

00:11:40.639 --> 00:11:41.473
Because he feels bad?

00:11:42.682 --> 00:11:44.601
Probably because he's embarrassed.

00:11:44.684 --> 00:11:47.062
Se-yeong, do you know what he said?

00:11:47.938 --> 00:11:49.231
"See you at the funeral."

00:11:49.314 --> 00:11:51.191
Whether you die or I die.

00:11:52.776 --> 00:11:55.987
Sure, he wouldn't have the face to show up
after raising his voice like that.

00:11:57.239 --> 00:11:59.574
Anyway, he can never see
what's ahead of him.

00:11:59.658 --> 00:12:02.410
-Kyeong-do… Now…
-Oh, hot.

00:12:03.453 --> 00:12:04.579
Why did he do that?

00:12:06.873 --> 00:12:07.874
Show me the way.

00:12:07.958 --> 00:12:08.875
To where?

00:12:08.959 --> 00:12:11.127
Where is Kyeong-do, that asshole? At work?

00:12:11.211 --> 00:12:13.171
But it's the weekend.

00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:16.258
The weekend… Okay.

00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:18.218
Who is it?

00:12:20.804 --> 00:12:22.973
Oh, what the hell? Oh, gosh.

00:12:24.432 --> 00:12:26.601
I thought you should talk to her
in person, Kyeong-do.

00:12:26.685 --> 00:12:28.562
Aren't you going to invite me in?

00:12:28.645 --> 00:12:30.063
But I have to get going.

00:12:30.146 --> 00:12:31.439
-Se-yeong.
-See you.

00:12:31.523 --> 00:12:34.234
This isn't right. No way. Se-yeong.

00:12:34.317 --> 00:12:37.112
Talk to each other! Work things out!

00:12:37.195 --> 00:12:39.447
Bye! See you!

00:12:41.032 --> 00:12:42.993
Damn it…

00:12:52.794 --> 00:12:54.337
Shit.

00:13:09.352 --> 00:13:11.021
SURELY TOMORROW

00:13:11.104 --> 00:13:12.272
"EPISODE 2"

00:13:18.194 --> 00:13:21.531
How can Se-yeong bring a stranger
to my house without notice…

00:13:21.615 --> 00:13:22.991
Don't be ridiculous.

00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:25.368
You think I'm being ridiculous?

00:13:25.452 --> 00:13:26.786
Don't you think you're too selfish?

00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:28.830
What, what do you mean?

00:13:29.789 --> 00:13:30.915
You did it first.

00:13:30.999 --> 00:13:34.461
Taking a stranger to someone else's house
without notice.

00:13:38.757 --> 00:13:39.924
SPRING, 2007

00:13:40.008 --> 00:13:42.385
It's a relief
that you had your wallet with you.

00:13:42.510 --> 00:13:43.637
Did the taxi cost a lot?

00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:47.557
What? Oh, I had a nest egg.

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:51.686
Oh, you should've called me.
Then I would've gone to Seoul.

00:13:51.770 --> 00:13:55.065
By taxi? Do you have any nest egg?

00:13:55.148 --> 00:13:59.944
I would borrow it from other guys, well.

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:05.867
Where are we?

00:14:07.035 --> 00:14:08.662
That's Se-yeong's house.

00:14:09.996 --> 00:14:11.498
Am I sleeping here?

00:14:14.209 --> 00:14:16.544
-The other guys sleep here too.
-The other guys too?

00:14:16.628 --> 00:14:18.004
Yes, you don't need to worry.

00:14:19.464 --> 00:14:21.383
But we have to walk up there quietly.

00:14:27.138 --> 00:14:28.431
Come in.

00:14:38.441 --> 00:14:40.694
-This? Are we going up here?
-Yes, go up.

00:14:40.777 --> 00:14:42.153
-Be careful.
-Okay.

00:14:46.449 --> 00:14:47.450
Come in.

00:15:05.677 --> 00:15:08.179
Do you see the bed?
We have to go to the bed.

00:15:39.002 --> 00:15:40.253
It's okay.

00:15:41.921 --> 00:15:42.922
Be careful.

00:16:04.652 --> 00:16:05.820
Let me send a text.

00:16:05.904 --> 00:16:07.363
With mine?

00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:17.957
To whom?

00:16:18.041 --> 00:16:18.917
My uncle.

00:16:26.674 --> 00:16:28.051
Go to bed.

00:16:31.888 --> 00:16:33.097
Okay.

00:16:34.057 --> 00:16:35.308
Hi, Ji-woo.

00:16:37.894 --> 00:16:39.437
Hi, how are you?

00:16:40.605 --> 00:16:42.816
How do you think I am?

00:16:43.608 --> 00:16:46.152
You guys are hypocrites.

00:17:30.154 --> 00:17:33.116
Anyway, don't you all have
your own places?

00:17:33.658 --> 00:17:34.492
-Yes.
-Yes.

00:17:34.576 --> 00:17:36.286
Then why do you sleep at Se-yeong's house?

00:17:36.369 --> 00:17:37.912
That's my question.

00:17:37.996 --> 00:17:39.497
Hey, the hangover food is not ready yet.

00:17:39.581 --> 00:17:40.790
What about you?

00:17:40.874 --> 00:17:42.292
I live with Woo-sik.

00:17:43.251 --> 00:17:45.503
Now you're clinging to me too.
Stock up on cup noodles.

00:17:45.587 --> 00:17:47.171
Thank you for the food.

00:17:47.255 --> 00:17:48.923
You said you'd go home. Why return?

00:17:49.007 --> 00:17:50.967
It's love, you jackass.

00:17:51.050 --> 00:17:53.052
Being called a jackass
this early in the morning?

00:17:53.136 --> 00:17:55.513
Imagine it's a replacement for kimchi.

00:17:55.597 --> 00:17:58.683
How can a jackass be kimchi?
What kind of kimchi is that?

00:17:58.766 --> 00:17:59.726
Stop it. Jesus!

00:17:59.809 --> 00:18:00.852
Wait until it's cooked.

00:18:00.935 --> 00:18:04.230
What is wrong with you?
Seriously, gosh. I'm so sick of you.

00:18:04.314 --> 00:18:07.859
-Are you not eating?
-Who said I'm not eating! Seriously…

00:18:08.735 --> 00:18:09.986
Did you eat?

00:18:10.069 --> 00:18:11.779
I had something delicious.

00:18:11.863 --> 00:18:15.116
If your mom finds out you slept out,
you're in trouble.

00:18:15.199 --> 00:18:18.286
If she's still quiet,
you probably covered it up.

00:18:18.369 --> 00:18:21.581
Taking care of you
is harder than driving you around, jeez.

00:18:21.664 --> 00:18:24.959
Here, get changed. Don't make it obvious
that you slept outside.

00:18:29.756 --> 00:18:33.051
Oh, whatever. Everything pisses me off.

00:18:34.052 --> 00:18:36.095
I think I was born at the wrong address.

00:18:36.179 --> 00:18:38.306
Hey, don't say that.

00:18:38.389 --> 00:18:40.892
Your mother's like that
because she's a cold fish.

00:18:41.476 --> 00:18:43.561
But the chairman cherishes you so much.

00:18:43.645 --> 00:18:46.147
But what's the point?
He sent me into exile in New York.

00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:49.484
Why is that exile?
You were studying abroad.

00:18:49.567 --> 00:18:51.736
It felt like exile to me.

00:18:55.156 --> 00:18:59.202
Anyway, are you going to keep lying?

00:18:59.285 --> 00:19:00.870
It's not like you go to this school.

00:19:02.830 --> 00:19:04.499
Does anyone know
that you're JARIM's daughter?

00:19:06.876 --> 00:19:11.965
Mr. Kim, if anyone finds out
that I am JARIM's daughter…

00:19:12.048 --> 00:19:16.594
then they'll start introducing me
as JARIM's daughter instead of Seo Ji-woo.

00:19:18.221 --> 00:19:19.222
I don't want that.

00:19:20.682 --> 00:19:23.059
Still, if they're true friends...

00:19:23.142 --> 00:19:25.687
If they become your friends,
you should tell them.

00:19:25.770 --> 00:19:27.855
If they find out later,
they might take it wrong.

00:19:27.939 --> 00:19:30.316
I was going to, but…

00:19:33.987 --> 00:19:36.114
I missed my timing.

00:19:39.158 --> 00:19:42.829
It's awkward to say it now. What do I do?

00:19:49.252 --> 00:19:52.714
I have a top secret.

00:19:52.797 --> 00:19:55.341
If it'd help you feel better,
I'll tell you.

00:19:55.425 --> 00:19:56.926
I'm not curious at all.

00:19:57.010 --> 00:19:59.095
No way. That's not true.
I'm sure you are curious.

00:19:59.929 --> 00:20:02.390
Gosh, should I tell you or not?

00:20:02.473 --> 00:20:03.933
Oh, what is it?

00:20:05.852 --> 00:20:09.105
Next week, the chairman and your mother
are going on a trip.

00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:12.608
-Is that it?
-That's it.

00:20:12.692 --> 00:20:14.569
But how is that…

00:20:14.652 --> 00:20:17.321
But it's not the first time
they're going on a trip.

00:20:17.405 --> 00:20:19.323
You always make me
go up and down like this…

00:20:19.407 --> 00:20:22.827
A cruise.
Six countries in Europe. Four weeks!

00:20:28.458 --> 00:20:29.292
Really?

00:20:29.375 --> 00:20:30.209
Really.

00:20:30.293 --> 00:20:32.378
-Really?
-Really!

00:20:32.962 --> 00:20:35.715
Mr. Kim. Mr. Kim, I love it!

00:20:35.798 --> 00:20:38.134
It's okay. Go get changed.

00:20:38.217 --> 00:20:40.803
-Mr. Kim, really? Really, really?
-It's okay.

00:20:41.387 --> 00:20:45.767
"Waiting for Godot."
How's your practice coming along?

00:20:45.850 --> 00:20:48.227
As long as Woo-sik does his job,
we're fine.

00:20:48.311 --> 00:20:49.937
You mess up the lines more.

00:20:50.563 --> 00:20:52.690
I think you need a manager.

00:20:52.774 --> 00:20:53.900
-Not necessarily.
-You do.

00:20:53.983 --> 00:20:55.568
How will the manager take care of us?

00:20:56.611 --> 00:20:59.906
Buy water and… prepare snacks.

00:20:59.989 --> 00:21:01.032
Also buy cigarettes?

00:21:01.115 --> 00:21:03.701
You really want a younger girl
to buy your cigarettes?

00:21:03.785 --> 00:21:07.872
What if we run out of cigarettes
while practicing hard?

00:21:07.955 --> 00:21:09.499
I'll have cartons ready.

00:21:11.417 --> 00:21:12.710
Thank you.

00:21:12.794 --> 00:21:17.298
From now on, I'll do my best for you
to focus only on the play practice.

00:21:17.381 --> 00:21:18.716
But why would you?

00:21:20.134 --> 00:21:24.764
So I'm going to provide intensive care
for the next 4 weeks…

00:21:25.348 --> 00:21:29.685
and you'll have to provide me
with housing.

00:21:29.769 --> 00:21:31.979
Wait, housing? Aren't you going home?

00:21:32.063 --> 00:21:34.774
Even our house is not stable.
We have overdue rent.

00:21:34.857 --> 00:21:36.776
I'll go to Se-yeong's house.

00:21:37.652 --> 00:21:38.820
I don't like that.

00:21:39.612 --> 00:21:43.074
Kyeong-do needs to practice too,
but the commute will distract him.

00:21:43.157 --> 00:21:44.826
You need to give him housing.

00:21:44.909 --> 00:21:47.286
Ji-woo, Kyeong-do has only two lines.

00:21:53.751 --> 00:21:55.169
But they're important lines.

00:21:55.253 --> 00:21:58.089
They're very important.
They're the essence.

00:21:58.172 --> 00:22:01.050
See? She's saying I'm not a hypocrite
for the first time.

00:22:01.801 --> 00:22:03.219
That's the key to my house. Copy it.

00:22:03.302 --> 00:22:04.428
Yes!

00:22:04.512 --> 00:22:06.180
Then the key to your house…

00:22:06.264 --> 00:22:09.183
You little… The door's open already, jeez.

00:22:10.685 --> 00:22:11.769
Down for a drink?

00:22:15.523 --> 00:22:16.899
One shot, two shots…

00:22:16.983 --> 00:22:18.734
I love it!

00:22:18.818 --> 00:22:20.862
Come along, hurry.

00:22:20.945 --> 00:22:22.363
Hey, it's on you!

00:22:23.156 --> 00:22:26.159
Is it necessary to live together
for four weeks for that?

00:22:26.242 --> 00:22:29.620
What am I supposed to do
with your dad during that time, son?

00:22:31.789 --> 00:22:33.249
Imagine I joined the army.

00:22:33.332 --> 00:22:35.751
You're experiencing it in advance.

00:22:35.835 --> 00:22:37.211
How about joining the army now?

00:22:37.295 --> 00:22:41.591
Dad, spit three times.
I can't join the army now.

00:22:41.674 --> 00:22:42.675
Spit, spit, spit!

00:22:44.135 --> 00:22:46.888
Don't you two fight.

00:22:54.395 --> 00:22:56.480
Why is that boy excited, honey?

00:22:56.564 --> 00:22:58.441
He said he's going to focus on studying.

00:22:58.524 --> 00:23:00.484
Do we have any choice but to trust him?

00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:04.947
-You like books?
-Used to read that a lot.

00:23:05.031 --> 00:23:07.575
-Comic books. It's your favorite.
-A biography like this…

00:23:08.910 --> 00:23:11.245
Oh, that's what you read every morning?

00:23:14.874 --> 00:23:16.417
-Hey, I think this is new.
-What?

00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:18.419
Wait. Do you want to check it out?

00:23:18.502 --> 00:23:22.048
Oh, but there's no reason to go in.
We might as well leave.

00:23:22.131 --> 00:23:23.382
What?

00:23:23.466 --> 00:23:25.468
-Hey, follow me.
-Vintage…

00:23:25.551 --> 00:23:28.971
Well, do you want to come back here later?

00:23:29.055 --> 00:23:30.306
Sure.

00:23:30.389 --> 00:23:34.852
Oh, aren't your parents coming back soon?

00:23:34.936 --> 00:23:36.604
Oh… Right.

00:23:38.147 --> 00:23:41.400
These last few weeks
were the fastest time in my life.

00:23:41.484 --> 00:23:42.860
They're coming back already.

00:23:42.944 --> 00:23:44.070
Be careful of the car.

00:23:46.239 --> 00:23:47.949
Didn't you say they went together?

00:23:49.116 --> 00:23:50.076
Yes.

00:23:50.743 --> 00:23:51.953
What do your parents do?

00:23:54.872 --> 00:23:56.624
They sell clothes.

00:23:56.707 --> 00:24:00.169
That's why you have a good sense of style.

00:24:00.253 --> 00:24:03.422
I don't wear what my dad sells.
They don't look good on me.

00:24:04.048 --> 00:24:08.094
Wait. Hey, that will look great on you.

00:24:08.177 --> 00:24:09.971
I'll work part-time to get it for you.

00:24:10.054 --> 00:24:12.598
It's okay.
I don't like that kind of style.

00:24:12.682 --> 00:24:13.683
No?

00:24:15.726 --> 00:24:18.062
I'm hungry. Let's get some tteokbokki.

00:24:18.145 --> 00:24:19.480
Hey, Ji-woo.

00:24:20.481 --> 00:24:21.857
Yes?

00:24:21.941 --> 00:24:25.027
Let's skip tteokbokki today.
We had that twice yesterday.

00:24:27.738 --> 00:24:28.739
But it's yummy.

00:24:31.617 --> 00:24:35.579
Sure, if you like it,
I'll eat it even three times. Let's go.

00:24:35.663 --> 00:24:36.664
Let's go.

00:24:48.509 --> 00:24:51.137
Waiting for Godot.

00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:54.640
Maybe it was made for you.
It sounds like "Waiting for Kyeong-do."

00:24:55.808 --> 00:24:56.892
Right.

00:24:59.020 --> 00:25:02.565
The two main characters
wait for Godot for fifty years.

00:25:05.985 --> 00:25:08.404
"Mr. Godot told me to tell you…

00:25:08.487 --> 00:25:10.906
he won't come this evening
but surely tomorrow."

00:25:14.035 --> 00:25:15.077
Shit…

00:25:20.374 --> 00:25:24.003
Godot never comes, but you will, right?

00:25:24.628 --> 00:25:27.757
I'm not going anywhere.
I'll always stay next to you.

00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:29.800
I'm saying what if.

00:25:29.884 --> 00:25:34.096
If I said I would wait for you,
would you come?

00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:36.307
Of course, I would.

00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:43.147
You know what?

00:25:43.230 --> 00:25:45.733
People say men shouldn't cry…

00:25:45.816 --> 00:25:47.610
but I'm not going to hold it in.

00:25:48.194 --> 00:25:49.195
Why not?

00:25:49.278 --> 00:25:55.242
A line in the play says,
the amount of tears is set.

00:25:56.911 --> 00:26:01.624
If someone starts crying,
someone else will stop crying.

00:26:03.250 --> 00:26:04.293
So…

00:26:06.420 --> 00:26:08.089
If I cry a lot…

00:26:11.050 --> 00:26:12.385
you won't be crying.

00:26:16.639 --> 00:26:17.807
You're so fucking cool.

00:26:21.102 --> 00:26:22.478
Oh, will you stop swearing?

00:26:22.561 --> 00:26:24.563
Tell a dog to stop pooping.

00:26:24.647 --> 00:26:26.357
Where did you learn that phrase?

00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:28.067
From Se-yeong.

00:26:28.150 --> 00:26:31.904
Hey, you need to leave that house.
You're becoming more and more weird.

00:26:31.987 --> 00:26:33.197
Let's run.

00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:34.156
What?

00:26:36.367 --> 00:26:37.368
But…

00:26:51.173 --> 00:26:53.300
Hey, get up.
Why are you lying on the ground?

00:26:53.384 --> 00:26:56.720
Hey, Kyeong-do. Lie down.

00:26:58.139 --> 00:27:00.266
Why in the schoolyard…

00:27:01.517 --> 00:27:02.518
Jesus.

00:27:08.190 --> 00:27:09.191
Isn't it beautiful?

00:27:18.993 --> 00:27:20.202
Do you want to sleep with me?

00:27:20.870 --> 00:27:22.538
If we sleep here,
your lips will get twisted.

00:27:23.622 --> 00:27:27.501
You idiot. I didn't mean that sleep.
I meant sex.

00:27:41.182 --> 00:27:42.183
Here…

00:27:45.060 --> 00:27:46.061
Here?

00:27:50.524 --> 00:27:51.984
There's no one here.

00:27:55.738 --> 00:27:56.864
Do you mean it?

00:27:56.947 --> 00:27:58.407
It'll be memorable.

00:28:01.076 --> 00:28:03.662
You know you're a total maniac, right?

00:28:07.166 --> 00:28:09.168
Let's do it, Kyeong-do.

00:28:15.007 --> 00:28:18.052
Hey. Get up. Get out of my way. Let's go.

00:28:18.636 --> 00:28:19.803
Let's do it, Kyeong-do.

00:28:19.887 --> 00:28:21.222
Are you crazy?

00:28:21.305 --> 00:28:23.307
Let's do it. Today is the only chance.

00:28:23.390 --> 00:28:25.142
Hey. Are you crazy? Why…

00:28:25.893 --> 00:28:28.103
Let's do it, Kyeong-do!

00:28:31.148 --> 00:28:32.983
-Let's do it, Kyeong-do. Come on.
-Stop.

00:28:33.067 --> 00:28:34.109
Hey, get up.

00:28:34.193 --> 00:28:38.155
Do it! Just do it!

00:28:41.700 --> 00:28:43.369
Gosh, seriously…

00:28:47.665 --> 00:28:50.209
Thanks!

00:29:05.015 --> 00:29:07.601
Do you still want to wear that shirt?

00:29:08.394 --> 00:29:10.479
It's that one, right?

00:29:13.148 --> 00:29:14.149
It's a similar one.

00:29:14.233 --> 00:29:15.901
So lame.

00:29:17.653 --> 00:29:21.031
Eighteen years?
Hey, that should be in museum.

00:29:21.115 --> 00:29:22.783
I began wearing it recently.

00:29:22.866 --> 00:29:25.286
I couldn't throw it out for your sake.
I'm an F.

00:29:25.369 --> 00:29:26.537
The neckline is stretched.

00:29:26.620 --> 00:29:27.913
I'm just frugal. Hey.

00:29:27.997 --> 00:29:31.250
Do you think saving enough
to lease a house like this is easy?

00:29:31.333 --> 00:29:33.085
Just be honest with me.

00:29:33.168 --> 00:29:35.337
You wore it stretched
because you missed me.

00:29:36.964 --> 00:29:38.716
Hey. Forget it.

00:29:38.799 --> 00:29:40.384
Why are you stripping?

00:29:43.596 --> 00:29:46.432
Besides, I told you
to release an article on my divorce.

00:29:46.515 --> 00:29:48.601
Then this wouldn't have happened.

00:29:48.684 --> 00:29:51.729
I knew it since you were arguing
to buy pork cutlet…

00:29:55.316 --> 00:29:58.068
Hey, whatever.
Settle it before you go to England.

00:29:58.152 --> 00:29:59.320
Why do I have to settle it?

00:29:59.403 --> 00:30:01.864
Not sure who took it,
but he wasn't trying to capture me.

00:30:01.947 --> 00:30:03.949
He was capturing your chaos.

00:30:04.033 --> 00:30:05.367
And I'm the scapegoat.

00:30:05.451 --> 00:30:07.703
Sure, let's say that.

00:30:07.786 --> 00:30:12.166
Then you should've come and asked me.
Why did you send Se-yeong?

00:30:12.249 --> 00:30:15.836
What, were you embarrassed
about that funeral statement?

00:30:18.088 --> 00:30:21.175
If you're making ends meet as a reporter,
shouldn't you watch your words?

00:30:22.635 --> 00:30:26.513
You think you got something on me?
You seem to enjoy this. Here to fight?

00:30:28.307 --> 00:30:29.308
I'm not doing it.

00:30:34.813 --> 00:30:35.898
Let me go.

00:30:39.234 --> 00:30:40.235
Let's do it…

00:30:40.319 --> 00:30:42.279
If you want to, act like you want to.

00:30:44.615 --> 00:30:48.452
I'm sorry about the funeral statement.
Happy now?

00:30:49.495 --> 00:30:51.538
I'm sorry about how you look right now.

00:31:00.506 --> 00:31:03.008
PRESS RELEASE PLAN PROPOSAL

00:31:07.805 --> 00:31:11.392
All right. Well, something like that.
What was I going to say?

00:31:12.017 --> 00:31:16.146
With the other guys and Se-yeong,
you and I will take a natural picture.

00:31:17.022 --> 00:31:20.025
It was an 18-year friendship.
Is that your concept?

00:31:20.109 --> 00:31:22.653
-So don't make it look like it was love?
-Exactly.

00:31:22.736 --> 00:31:24.488
Then what are these brands?

00:31:27.116 --> 00:31:28.992
That is…

00:31:29.076 --> 00:31:30.119
It's nothing hard.

00:31:30.202 --> 00:31:34.832
While taking a picture,
bring me what Seo Ji-woo's wearing.

00:31:34.915 --> 00:31:35.833
Why?

00:31:35.916 --> 00:31:38.544
You know Kim Ga-eul, the editor-in-chief?
Of a fashion magazine?

00:31:38.627 --> 00:31:39.837
Why?

00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:41.296
Will you stop asking why?

00:31:42.423 --> 00:31:45.342
Well, Kim Ga-eul called me.

00:31:45.968 --> 00:31:48.846
She said the main brand
of this month is Louis.

00:31:48.929 --> 00:31:52.641
If Seo Ji-woo wears Louis
from head to toe…

00:31:52.725 --> 00:31:54.810
they'll take advantage of it.

00:31:56.812 --> 00:31:58.897
Gosh, don't you think that's too much?

00:32:03.068 --> 00:32:05.028
Didn't I tell you
that I'm about to resign?

00:32:05.112 --> 00:32:08.615
Since we're on it already,
we might as well save you, save me,

00:32:08.699 --> 00:32:12.703
save Dongwoon Daily's Entertainment Team,
and save the fashion magazine, yeah?

00:32:12.786 --> 00:32:14.913
Let's all survive together!

00:32:17.166 --> 00:32:18.834
Oh, why me…

00:32:20.836 --> 00:32:27.342
All right. But if you don't have
any purses or shoes from this brand, then…

00:32:27.426 --> 00:32:28.260
You think I don't?

00:32:29.261 --> 00:32:30.304
I'm jealous.

00:32:31.221 --> 00:32:32.890
Worry about yourself.

00:32:32.973 --> 00:32:36.226
Oh, wear this.
It's perfect to bring back memories.

00:32:38.479 --> 00:32:40.564
Hey, whatever. Don't do it.

00:32:40.647 --> 00:32:42.858
Gosh, do you even know
who caused all this?

00:32:42.941 --> 00:32:45.611
This will be fun.
Looking forward to seeing the guys.

00:32:45.694 --> 00:32:46.737
Proceed with it.

00:32:49.615 --> 00:32:50.657
Bye.

00:32:51.784 --> 00:32:55.871
Oh, right. Don't you exercise?
You're getting a bit of a belly.

00:33:01.835 --> 00:33:02.795
Damn it…

00:33:18.811 --> 00:33:20.270
Hey. Forget it.

00:33:20.354 --> 00:33:21.563
Why are you stripping?

00:33:26.610 --> 00:33:27.611
That's great.

00:33:49.716 --> 00:33:50.592
Enjoy.

00:33:55.764 --> 00:33:56.765
I'd like some too.

00:34:06.233 --> 00:34:07.734
Just be honest with me.

00:34:07.818 --> 00:34:10.070
You wore it stretched
because you missed me.

00:34:16.243 --> 00:34:19.288
You should've thrown it out, you dickhead…

00:34:23.458 --> 00:34:26.295
Damn it…

00:34:39.558 --> 00:34:40.642
Yes.

00:34:41.643 --> 00:34:42.644
I'm on my way.

00:34:42.728 --> 00:34:44.897
Oh, did you leave already?

00:34:44.980 --> 00:34:47.649
Well, Father's suddenly scheduled
for a meeting.

00:34:50.027 --> 00:34:52.279
He was worried
because of the ruckus in the foundation.

00:34:53.030 --> 00:34:55.365
What do you want?
Do you want to eat by ourselves?

00:34:55.449 --> 00:34:56.992
Where are you?

00:34:57.075 --> 00:34:59.745
I'm here. Had some business nearby,
so I came early.

00:34:59.828 --> 00:35:02.080
I'll be there soon. Let's eat together.

00:35:02.164 --> 00:35:02.998
Sure.

00:35:03.081 --> 00:35:03.999
Bye.

00:35:26.271 --> 00:35:27.689
When's Ji-woo leaving?

00:35:32.402 --> 00:35:35.030
Honey, you should eat.

00:35:36.114 --> 00:35:37.866
What are you thinking about?

00:35:39.326 --> 00:35:44.081
I don't plan to get married yet.

00:35:44.790 --> 00:35:46.083
What?

00:35:47.709 --> 00:35:49.753
What about you?

00:35:51.004 --> 00:35:53.882
Are you doing this
because your family forced you?

00:35:54.967 --> 00:35:58.261
That's what I want to know.

00:36:03.850 --> 00:36:06.436
Seo Ji-yeon, are you okay?

00:36:07.396 --> 00:36:09.356
You don't look good.

00:36:10.857 --> 00:36:14.528
That doesn't mean I don't like you.

00:36:14.611 --> 00:36:20.742
It's just everything's happening
all of a sudden. I guess I'm afraid.

00:36:23.328 --> 00:36:25.122
So you're saying…

00:36:26.164 --> 00:36:29.001
we're getting married soon, is that right?

00:36:30.460 --> 00:36:34.089
What's your ideal type?

00:36:38.093 --> 00:36:39.219
My ideal type?

00:36:41.388 --> 00:36:42.848
That's new.

00:36:44.641 --> 00:36:46.184
Here, eat.

00:36:48.895 --> 00:36:50.981
The food tastes good today.

00:36:51.064 --> 00:36:52.065
Here…

00:36:53.150 --> 00:36:54.151
-Eat.
-Okay.

00:37:09.332 --> 00:37:11.543
They want to add your picture
in the article.

00:37:20.469 --> 00:37:21.970
Why add my picture?

00:37:22.054 --> 00:37:25.307
Hey, just one group photo
isn't enough for the article.

00:37:25.390 --> 00:37:27.601
That's not enough for the story,
you know what I mean?

00:37:28.685 --> 00:37:32.731
If it's too bothersome to find one,
we can use your photo on your employee ID.

00:37:32.814 --> 00:37:35.442
Whatever. Oh, don't do that, seriously.

00:37:36.193 --> 00:37:38.612
I'm going to immigrate. Don't do that.

00:37:48.121 --> 00:37:52.167
Do you have a kimchi fridge in mind?
Get a new one this year.

00:37:52.250 --> 00:37:54.836
Everything looks good.

00:37:54.920 --> 00:37:58.423
But they're all too big
and take up too much space…

00:37:58.507 --> 00:37:59.591
so I'm hesitating--

00:38:00.842 --> 00:38:02.052
What? What brings you home?

00:38:02.135 --> 00:38:04.096
Oh, just here to find something.

00:38:25.450 --> 00:38:27.577
I'm sure I didn't throw it out.

00:38:33.792 --> 00:38:34.793
Here…

00:38:36.962 --> 00:38:38.922
Oh, here it is.

00:38:39.005 --> 00:38:40.132
WAITING FOR GODOT

00:38:45.929 --> 00:38:47.264
Let's put it here, honey.

00:38:47.889 --> 00:38:49.015
Put what?

00:38:49.099 --> 00:38:52.310
It's not like you're moving back.
Take all your stuff with you.

00:38:52.394 --> 00:38:54.688
Mom, if you put the kimchi fridge
in my room…

00:38:54.771 --> 00:38:56.606
it'd be too far away for you.

00:38:56.690 --> 00:38:59.860
I'm going to remove the wall.
For the house to become brighter.

00:38:59.943 --> 00:39:02.654
But we still need a room for him.

00:39:02.737 --> 00:39:07.492
So when he gets married,
he'd bring his children. That's love.

00:39:07.576 --> 00:39:09.286
When will he get married?

00:39:09.369 --> 00:39:11.663
I thought he was marrying her,
but she's just a friend.

00:39:13.415 --> 00:39:15.834
Lately, I've been thinking,

00:39:15.917 --> 00:39:19.254
every time I give congratulatory money
at a wedding, I consider it a donation.

00:39:19.337 --> 00:39:23.592
And I always get sick
when I try to eat as much as I paid.

00:39:30.473 --> 00:39:31.308
Dad, I'll get going.

00:39:31.391 --> 00:39:34.853
Hey. You started this,
and now you dare run off?

00:39:35.896 --> 00:39:36.938
I don't think I can.

00:39:37.022 --> 00:39:39.608
Hey, Kyeong-do!

00:39:52.204 --> 00:39:53.371
You guys overdid it.

00:39:53.455 --> 00:39:55.916
-It's not any different from usual.
-I'm the same.

00:39:55.999 --> 00:39:58.418
Jeez, you hypocrites.

00:40:27.489 --> 00:40:32.410
-Oh, Ji-woo. Come here.
-Oh, Ji-woo. You look so pretty.

00:40:32.494 --> 00:40:34.537
-You got so pretty!
-Hi, guys.

00:40:34.621 --> 00:40:36.289
Oh, Ji-woo!

00:40:36.373 --> 00:40:38.667
Me too. I knew you'd come.

00:40:38.750 --> 00:40:39.668
Hey, it's been ages.

00:40:39.751 --> 00:40:42.087
-It's been too long, right?
-Yes.

00:40:42.170 --> 00:40:45.173
Everyone's here.
Let's take a quick picture and leave.

00:40:45.257 --> 00:40:48.718
Everyone gathered to save Lee Kyeong-do.
Right? We're so loyal.

00:40:48.802 --> 00:40:53.098
Are you ready now?
All right. Let's take a picture.

00:40:53.181 --> 00:40:54.182
Do you still have that?

00:40:54.266 --> 00:40:55.558
Questions waste time.

00:40:55.642 --> 00:40:58.144
Stay outside. Come back when we're ready.
Why're you in such a rush?

00:40:58.228 --> 00:40:59.729
He's desperate.

00:40:59.813 --> 00:41:02.565
"Desperate…" Ji-woo, you haven't changed.

00:41:02.649 --> 00:41:03.942
I found this.

00:41:04.567 --> 00:41:05.527
Wait, what's this?

00:41:09.572 --> 00:41:12.075
I should've seen the Godot play
before I left.

00:41:12.158 --> 00:41:13.660
That's what I regret the most.

00:41:13.743 --> 00:41:16.621
I regret doing it.
You're lucky that you didn't see it.

00:41:16.705 --> 00:41:17.664
Hey, this ass--

00:41:17.747 --> 00:41:18.999
Woo-sik, don't.

00:41:19.082 --> 00:41:20.667
He totally forgot his lines!

00:41:20.750 --> 00:41:21.876
Stop it!

00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:23.253
"Ji-woo isn't coming."

00:41:23.336 --> 00:41:26.589
"No matter how long I wait,
Ji-woo won't come!"

00:41:26.673 --> 00:41:30.969
That's what this idiot said on stage.
And then he kept sobbing.

00:41:31.052 --> 00:41:33.763
-So, we, we just closed the curtains.
-Oh, stop it.

00:41:33.847 --> 00:41:36.850
-Right, right, right.
-And from that moment, he began crying…

00:41:36.933 --> 00:41:39.185
"Woo-sik, Ji-woo is not coming. Ji-woo…"

00:41:39.269 --> 00:41:40.895
Stop it, you asshole!

00:41:44.941 --> 00:41:48.611
Lee Kyeong-do, is that true?
Did you really do that?

00:41:50.655 --> 00:41:55.410
I was young, immature, and vulnerable.
I was innocent and sincere.

00:41:57.787 --> 00:42:01.082
Sincere, my ass. Do you know
how much we spent on the ticket refunds?

00:42:01.166 --> 00:42:02.709
Why cling to the past?

00:42:02.792 --> 00:42:07.339
It was your idea to gather
and bring back the past.

00:42:12.844 --> 00:42:14.804
Well, is that Louis?

00:42:14.888 --> 00:42:17.057
Why wear Louis when my sister has a brand?

00:42:17.140 --> 00:42:18.391
The shoes and the bag will do.

00:42:18.475 --> 00:42:19.642
I'm wearing Louis, Kyeong-do.

00:42:19.726 --> 00:42:23.313
Jeong-min doesn't look like
he's wearing a luxury brand.

00:42:23.396 --> 00:42:26.608
Cha Woo-sik, have you ever tried on
a luxury brand before? Yeah?

00:42:26.691 --> 00:42:29.110
Woo-sik himself is a luxury brand.

00:42:29.194 --> 00:42:30.028
I am the luxury!

00:42:30.111 --> 00:42:33.490
I can't tell.
You shouldn't talk about fashion!

00:42:33.573 --> 00:42:36.034
I didn't know
we were having a trot singer today here.

00:42:36.117 --> 00:42:39.621
Wait, I can see through…

00:42:46.044 --> 00:42:47.796
Look here. Dong-won, are you ready?

00:42:47.879 --> 00:42:48.838
Yes.

00:42:48.922 --> 00:42:50.799
He's handsome. Didn't take after his dad.

00:42:50.882 --> 00:42:53.134
Ignore her
and focus on taking the picture.

00:42:53.218 --> 00:42:54.969
-Focus on me, okay?
-Okay.

00:42:55.053 --> 00:42:58.681
-Dong-won, is the academy sign in?
-Yes, it's in.

00:42:58.765 --> 00:43:00.141
Okay, get ready.

00:43:00.225 --> 00:43:02.602
All right.
Count before you take a picture.

00:43:02.685 --> 00:43:04.145
One, two, three.

00:43:06.689 --> 00:43:08.817
Dad, get closer.

00:43:08.900 --> 00:43:10.693
-Let's all change the pose.
-Okay.

00:43:10.777 --> 00:43:12.529
-Like the beauty pageant.
-One, two…

00:43:12.612 --> 00:43:14.322
This is kind of a pressure.

00:43:42.767 --> 00:43:46.896
If Woo-sik posts it on his social media,
is your company publishing it?

00:43:46.980 --> 00:43:48.148
Yes.

00:43:50.066 --> 00:43:51.985
Anyway, thanks.

00:43:55.280 --> 00:43:59.868
I got to meet the guys before I leave.
Thanks for that.

00:44:04.706 --> 00:44:05.790
When are you leaving?

00:44:07.167 --> 00:44:08.168
Next week.

00:44:12.505 --> 00:44:16.634
Eat well when you go to England.

00:44:18.303 --> 00:44:19.679
I will.

00:44:21.556 --> 00:44:24.851
Eat well, sleep well.

00:44:25.518 --> 00:44:27.020
Poop well.

00:44:29.105 --> 00:44:32.400
Hey, being too explicit isn't charming.

00:44:32.484 --> 00:44:37.030
What? Eating and sleeping are elegant,
but pooping is vulgar?

00:44:38.823 --> 00:44:43.411
Fine. Eat well, sleep well, poop well.

00:44:45.330 --> 00:44:46.706
Be careful...

00:44:48.208 --> 00:44:51.252
when you meet new people,
whoever they are.

00:44:58.551 --> 00:45:00.762
As long as I don't meet someone like you.

00:45:04.641 --> 00:45:05.642
Right.

00:45:06.976 --> 00:45:07.977
It's a joke.

00:45:09.145 --> 00:45:10.313
Exactly.

00:45:17.028 --> 00:45:19.030
Will things calm down
when the article gets released?

00:45:20.406 --> 00:45:24.118
It doesn't matter to me since I'm leaving,
but I'm worried about you.

00:45:24.202 --> 00:45:27.080
You got dragged into my mess
and almost had your life messed up again.

00:45:41.886 --> 00:45:42.887
Wait.

00:45:47.559 --> 00:45:48.601
You're wrong.

00:45:50.812 --> 00:45:52.605
You got two things wrong.

00:45:53.648 --> 00:45:55.441
I never got dragged into it.

00:45:55.525 --> 00:45:57.402
And my life
had never been messed up before.

00:46:03.116 --> 00:46:05.159
What a fucking reporter.

00:46:16.671 --> 00:46:19.132
She never stops swearing.

00:46:41.529 --> 00:46:43.364
Why does he have to be so damn kind?

00:47:10.892 --> 00:47:13.686
Woo-sik. I just got home.
There was no traffic.

00:47:13.770 --> 00:47:15.563
-Hey, Kyeong-do.
-Yeah?

00:47:15.647 --> 00:47:18.232
It was nice to be with Ji-woo again
after a while.

00:47:20.526 --> 00:47:24.405
Well, there's nothing bad
or good about it…

00:47:24.489 --> 00:47:30.161
Man, stop lying. Hey, your eyes
were so busy peeping on Ji-woo in secret.

00:47:31.204 --> 00:47:33.748
Hey, I'm tired.
I have no energy to joke around.

00:47:34.791 --> 00:47:38.753
You know what?
Well, you'll be at peace if you admit it.

00:47:39.379 --> 00:47:44.300
Oh, right! Woo-sik,
did I leave that Godot brochure there?

00:47:45.343 --> 00:47:46.803
No, I just…

00:47:47.845 --> 00:47:50.765
Oh, hey. That was taken out of your bag.

00:47:50.848 --> 00:47:51.849
By whom?

00:47:54.268 --> 00:47:55.645
Which asshole?

00:47:59.565 --> 00:48:01.567
WHAT IS YOUR GODOT?

00:48:01.651 --> 00:48:02.652
Hey, this ass--

00:48:02.735 --> 00:48:03.986
Woo-sik, don't.

00:48:04.070 --> 00:48:05.530
He totally forgot his lines!

00:48:05.613 --> 00:48:06.489
Stop it!

00:48:06.572 --> 00:48:08.116
"Ji-woo isn't coming."

00:48:08.199 --> 00:48:11.202
"No matter how long I wait,
Ji-woo won't come!"

00:48:11.285 --> 00:48:15.039
Lee Kyeong-do, is that true?
Did you really do that?

00:48:15.123 --> 00:48:19.877
I was young, immature, and vulnerable.
I was innocent and sincere.

00:48:27.218 --> 00:48:29.846
BOY LEE KYEONG-DO

00:48:37.854 --> 00:48:39.731
You got two things wrong.

00:48:39.814 --> 00:48:41.232
I never got dragged into it.

00:48:41.315 --> 00:48:43.067
And my life
had never been messed up before.

00:48:56.914 --> 00:49:00.251
"Only if one could entreat Elder Wolha…"

00:49:02.128 --> 00:49:03.713
So he can…

00:49:14.432 --> 00:49:16.726
It's over. That's it.

00:49:16.809 --> 00:49:18.436
Fine, just keep it.

00:49:18.519 --> 00:49:21.397
Now, it's over. The end.

00:49:31.491 --> 00:49:35.453
JARIM'S SEO JI-WOO'S UNEXPECTED CHARM
'ACTING CLUB'

00:49:37.538 --> 00:49:41.083
"The meeting was reportedly intended
as an opportunity

00:49:41.167 --> 00:49:44.086
to express frustration toward a reporter

00:49:44.170 --> 00:49:47.840
preparing an article
about Seo Ji-woo's ex-husband."

00:49:47.924 --> 00:49:53.346
"Cha explained that he released the photo
out of regret...

00:49:53.429 --> 00:49:57.683
over how their long-standing friendship

00:49:57.767 --> 00:49:59.977
had been misrepresented."

00:50:01.437 --> 00:50:06.275
"Meanwhile, this newly revealed photo
of 20-year-old Seo Ji-woo has gone viral."

00:50:08.444 --> 00:50:11.113
THE CHAEBOL FASHION ICON'S
DRESS, BAG, JEWELRY SOLD OUT

00:50:13.574 --> 00:50:16.786
HER PRESENCE ALONE IS ICONIC…
HER DRESS TOPS THE SEARCH WORD

00:50:21.457 --> 00:50:25.127
Lee Kyeong-do, nice defense.

00:50:37.890 --> 00:50:39.809
Yes, can you look into...

00:50:40.434 --> 00:50:41.310
Where's Secretary Cha?

00:50:41.394 --> 00:50:43.396
She went to a meeting with the PR team.

00:50:44.772 --> 00:50:45.773
Did she?

00:50:47.775 --> 00:50:48.609
Okay.

00:50:58.703 --> 00:51:01.706
Are you in a meeting?
I need to look something up.

00:51:01.789 --> 00:51:05.334
Can you get me the contact number
of Reporter Lee Kyeong-do?

00:51:23.269 --> 00:51:25.313
Ms. Seo is moving alone.

00:51:35.072 --> 00:51:36.032
Yes, Director Kang.

00:51:37.658 --> 00:51:39.410
She didn't say anything.

00:51:41.037 --> 00:51:42.204
She took the taxi.

00:51:42.288 --> 00:51:43.331
Okay, got it.

00:51:47.585 --> 00:51:48.753
CALLING…
RO-A'S MOM

00:51:52.214 --> 00:51:56.093
The call cannot be connected.
Please leave a message…

00:51:57.845 --> 00:51:59.764
Where did she go without the driver?

00:52:05.937 --> 00:52:09.023
SOMANG LAUNDROMAT

00:52:42.431 --> 00:52:45.476
SURGERY DEPARTMENT ICU

00:52:45.559 --> 00:52:47.019
-You must be worried.
-Yes.

00:52:47.103 --> 00:52:48.354
Let me check the patient.

00:52:50.648 --> 00:52:52.024
Here, here.

00:52:52.108 --> 00:52:53.401
-Oh, my gosh.
-What, why?

00:52:56.153 --> 00:53:00.950
This place has a nice color.

00:53:19.927 --> 00:53:21.721
-Enjoy.
-Oh, yes. Thank you.

00:53:28.227 --> 00:53:31.188
Wait, I'll eat on my own.
You never did that before.

00:53:31.272 --> 00:53:34.650
But they grilled the meat for us.
I can't even grab it for you?

00:53:34.734 --> 00:53:38.696
Oh, this is too much. Seriously.
You should've been nice to me sooner.

00:53:38.779 --> 00:53:43.242
Then how am I supposed
to thank Assistant Manager Lee Kyeong-do?

00:53:44.994 --> 00:53:45.995
Okay.

00:53:49.248 --> 00:53:50.499
Is it good?

00:53:50.583 --> 00:53:51.417
Totally.

00:54:00.843 --> 00:54:05.264
So? Is Seo Ji-woo going to England
or something?

00:54:07.516 --> 00:54:12.563
Oh, whatever. It's over now. The end.

00:54:13.189 --> 00:54:14.190
Okay.

00:54:15.107 --> 00:54:18.569
My forever rival Seo Ji-woo is out now.

00:54:18.652 --> 00:54:20.571
It's up to me now.

00:54:23.574 --> 00:54:26.660
Why is Seo Ji-woo Jin Han-kyeong's rival?

00:54:26.744 --> 00:54:30.539
Hey, it's been 10 years
since I've been asking you out.

00:54:30.623 --> 00:54:32.458
That's why she's my enemy.

00:54:32.541 --> 00:54:35.044
You're cutting me off
because you couldn't move on.

00:54:36.212 --> 00:54:39.799
"Date me and I'll buy you a car."
"Date me and I'll fund your lease."

00:54:39.882 --> 00:54:44.929
"I got the Louis collaboration sneakers.
If you date me, they're yours."

00:54:45.012 --> 00:54:46.555
You call that asking me out?

00:54:46.639 --> 00:54:48.349
I was asking you out.

00:54:49.767 --> 00:54:52.019
Good. I like how you're consistent.

00:54:52.686 --> 00:54:54.480
Hold on. I have something to show you.

00:54:55.689 --> 00:54:56.690
You sound determined.

00:54:56.774 --> 00:54:58.776
Ta-da.

00:55:00.069 --> 00:55:01.779
I bought a house in Oksu-dong.

00:55:04.990 --> 00:55:08.327
Have you seen anyone
buying a house without a mortgage?

00:55:08.410 --> 00:55:10.704
Look. That's me.

00:55:12.790 --> 00:55:13.624
You're showing off.

00:55:13.707 --> 00:55:17.002
Why do you think I'm showing off?
You should move in with me.

00:55:17.086 --> 00:55:18.420
Oh, really?

00:55:20.214 --> 00:55:22.633
Oh, don't call your mother already.

00:55:22.716 --> 00:55:23.592
Come on.

00:55:23.676 --> 00:55:25.261
Why are you so hasty?

00:55:25.344 --> 00:55:26.804
Still, I should tell her.

00:55:28.222 --> 00:55:29.640
-Here, press it.
-Already…

00:55:31.100 --> 00:55:32.768
Did that not work?

00:55:33.644 --> 00:55:36.480
Jeez, so cheap. Seriously, so cheap.

00:55:36.564 --> 00:55:38.607
-Would you move in if it's Apgujeong?
-So call them.

00:55:38.691 --> 00:55:40.317
Put that away. Damn it.

00:55:43.737 --> 00:55:46.657
Good job. I know that was hard.

00:55:47.783 --> 00:55:50.327
So don't say
you want to go for round two after this.

00:55:50.411 --> 00:55:52.246
I'm having ice cream.

00:55:52.329 --> 00:55:54.665
Seriously, enough with the ice cream.

00:55:58.085 --> 00:55:59.086
Hello?

00:55:59.962 --> 00:56:00.963
Yes.

00:56:02.381 --> 00:56:04.633
What? Where?

00:56:23.027 --> 00:56:24.028
That was fast.

00:56:24.570 --> 00:56:25.529
Nice to meet you.

00:56:26.071 --> 00:56:27.406
This isn't the first time we've met.

00:56:28.741 --> 00:56:32.203
We met when you were working
at a hotel buffet in college.

00:56:35.122 --> 00:56:36.123
I see.

00:56:37.958 --> 00:56:39.126
Anyway, what brings you here?

00:56:40.586 --> 00:56:42.671
I wanted to meet you as soon as possible,

00:56:42.755 --> 00:56:46.217
and if I came here,
I thought you'd come as fast as you could.

00:56:47.509 --> 00:56:49.053
Is it about the article today?

00:56:49.136 --> 00:56:52.598
That too, and I have a favor to ask you.

00:56:57.519 --> 00:56:59.897
The article about Ji-woo's ex-husband.

00:56:59.980 --> 00:57:04.360
Ji-woo already thanked me for that.
Why did you want to see me?

00:57:04.443 --> 00:57:05.945
A picture of you two was taken.

00:57:06.028 --> 00:57:08.405
Yes, to explain that--

00:57:08.489 --> 00:57:09.698
I took it.

00:57:12.660 --> 00:57:15.579
I didn't take it myself. I paid someone.

00:57:15.663 --> 00:57:18.874
Anyway, I reported it.

00:57:30.219 --> 00:57:31.220
Why?

00:57:32.429 --> 00:57:34.640
To tie Ji-woo down.

00:57:34.723 --> 00:57:35.599
What?

00:57:35.683 --> 00:57:38.435
You heard
Ji-woo's going to England, right?

00:57:39.144 --> 00:57:44.316
If she leaves now,
she'll have no standing.

00:57:44.400 --> 00:57:47.069
If she leaves now,
she'll have no standing.

00:57:47.152 --> 00:57:50.197
And you're the only person
who can stop her.

00:57:55.119 --> 00:57:59.039
I don't know what you're talking about.

00:57:59.123 --> 00:58:01.959
Ji-woo needs to return to the company.

00:58:03.585 --> 00:58:07.798
Ji-woo will run JARIM Apparel
better than me.

00:58:07.881 --> 00:58:09.758
You saw the article today, right?

00:58:09.842 --> 00:58:12.678
The two-piece set that Ji-woo wore
sold out immediately.

00:58:14.513 --> 00:58:18.183
Ji-woo is better at fashion than I am.

00:58:27.901 --> 00:58:30.195
Well then. I had a long day today.

00:58:30.279 --> 00:58:31.905
Stop Ji-woo.

00:58:34.908 --> 00:58:39.204
Why are you doing this, really?
There's nothing between me and her.

00:58:41.290 --> 00:58:42.750
Really?

00:58:46.253 --> 00:58:51.133
Were you 28? You and Ji-woo.

00:58:51.216 --> 00:58:52.051
Look.

00:58:52.134 --> 00:58:55.554
After Ji-woo left
and your father's treatment was over,

00:58:55.637 --> 00:58:57.348
you spent a year drunk.

00:59:00.225 --> 00:59:05.856
There should be nothing between you two,
but you could still worry about her.

00:59:06.982 --> 00:59:07.983
Jeez.

00:59:08.984 --> 00:59:11.695
What are you pulling at? Huh?

00:59:11.779 --> 00:59:14.114
Seo Ji-woo and Seo Ji-yeon.
What are you two women doing?

00:59:14.198 --> 00:59:17.993
Our mom is not a good mom.

00:59:18.077 --> 00:59:20.412
Not to mention that my husband is worse.

00:59:20.496 --> 00:59:23.082
So what does that have to do with me?

00:59:24.750 --> 00:59:28.712
Ji-woo will become penniless.

00:59:29.296 --> 00:59:33.592
If she leaves now...
In a year or two years...

00:59:34.802 --> 00:59:36.303
Ji-woo…

00:59:39.014 --> 00:59:43.143
Ji-woo will be a beggar.

00:59:45.479 --> 00:59:49.066
My mom is powerless,
and my husband is not a good man.

00:59:49.149 --> 00:59:51.693
I'm the only one who can protect Ji-woo.

00:59:54.238 --> 00:59:55.572
But I'm…

00:59:57.616 --> 01:00:00.327
I'm losing my memories.

01:00:04.289 --> 01:00:07.709
I have Alzheimer's.

01:00:14.341 --> 01:00:17.886
Divorce isn't the best option.

01:00:17.970 --> 01:00:20.973
It'll take a long time,
and my chances of winning aren't high.

01:00:21.640 --> 01:00:25.853
If I become blank before that,
my husband will sell the company.

01:00:28.439 --> 01:00:32.901
I can't explain everything,
why Ji-woo's likely to become penniless.

01:00:34.903 --> 01:00:37.823
JARIM APPAREL

01:00:39.741 --> 01:00:46.707
The only way is for JARIM Apparel
to become Seo Ji-woo's company.

01:01:06.602 --> 01:01:08.937
My dad and I
are the first generation of JARIM.

01:01:09.021 --> 01:01:12.441
And Ji-woo has more than enough
to become the second generation of JARIM.

01:01:18.489 --> 01:01:20.282
Please stop Ji-woo.

01:01:21.575 --> 01:01:22.576
Next person in line.

01:01:22.659 --> 01:01:27.414
If you don't want to talk about old love,
can you do it for your friendship?

01:01:28.081 --> 01:01:32.252
Hello. Can you show me
your ticket and your passport? Okay.

01:01:35.214 --> 01:01:36.882
Do you have any luggage?

01:01:36.965 --> 01:01:37.799
Yes.

01:01:37.883 --> 01:01:38.842
Can you put it up here?

01:01:40.802 --> 01:01:41.887
Let's talk.

01:01:41.970 --> 01:01:43.013
Are you crazy?

01:01:45.516 --> 01:01:48.352
First of all, since you're here,
put it up here. It's heavy.

01:01:48.435 --> 01:01:49.603
Let's talk.

01:01:49.686 --> 01:01:51.021
I have to get on board.

01:01:51.104 --> 01:01:51.939
Take the next one.

01:01:52.022 --> 01:01:53.357
This isn't KTX.

01:01:56.527 --> 01:01:59.238
Sorry about that.
Hey, put it up here first. No, put…

01:02:00.781 --> 01:02:03.283
Can I have my passport back?
Sorry, I'll be right back.

01:02:03.367 --> 01:02:04.785
That crazy bastard…

01:02:06.787 --> 01:02:08.080
Hey, Lee Kyeong-do. Hey!

01:02:08.163 --> 01:02:11.333
What the heck is wrong with him?
This is crazy.

01:02:16.296 --> 01:02:19.466
Hey, Lee Kyeong-do. Stop right there. Hey!

01:02:22.511 --> 01:02:23.637
Oh, seriously.

01:02:26.890 --> 01:02:27.724
Jeez.

01:02:32.771 --> 01:02:36.942
Oh, sir! Stop him. That guy.
Catch him. Hurry!

01:02:38.735 --> 01:02:40.195
Sir, can we have a moment?

01:02:40.279 --> 01:02:42.406
Yes. We know each other.

01:02:43.740 --> 01:02:44.741
Mom?

01:02:45.367 --> 01:02:46.201
Catch him.

01:02:46.285 --> 01:02:49.037
-Wait, wait. I'm not a bad guy.
-Let's talk over there.

01:02:49.121 --> 01:02:50.872
Come with us.

01:02:51.873 --> 01:02:53.041
Wait.

01:03:00.424 --> 01:03:04.344
SURELY TOMORROW

01:03:05.262 --> 01:03:06.638
I thought it was a color film.

01:03:06.722 --> 01:03:08.557
Black and white makes it look cool.

01:03:08.640 --> 01:03:09.808
Say it again to Ji-woo's face.

01:03:09.891 --> 01:03:11.977
Our matching items aren't visible.

01:03:12.060 --> 01:03:13.520
It's not visible!

01:03:13.604 --> 01:03:17.858
Why's this a big deal?
Shouldn't have brought the camera. Shit.

01:03:17.941 --> 01:03:20.110
I feel black and white.
Let's grab a drink.

01:03:20.193 --> 01:03:22.029
Sure, it's on, black and white Jeong-min.

01:03:22.112 --> 01:03:25.365
I developed it too.
Don't you have a sense of shame?

01:03:28.493 --> 01:03:29.328
Ji-woo.

01:03:30.996 --> 01:03:33.165
You look pretty
because it's black and white.

01:03:33.248 --> 01:03:34.750
You want a punch in the face?

01:03:34.833 --> 01:03:36.543
Let's go. Come on. Let's go.

01:03:36.627 --> 01:03:39.546
Kyeong-do. Kyeong-do?

01:04:20.921 --> 01:04:24.299
I turned off the gas valve. I ran out of
underwear, so I took one of yours.

01:04:25.300 --> 01:04:27.302
No questions, please.

01:04:27.386 --> 01:04:29.054
Is running away your specialty?

01:04:30.347 --> 01:04:32.099
Did you get on top of him?

01:04:32.182 --> 01:04:35.560
I just pulled a prank
to see what he's like.

01:04:36.395 --> 01:04:38.605
Do you really like me?

01:04:39.648 --> 01:04:42.109
You never blame me even a little.
That pisses me off even more.

01:04:42.192 --> 01:04:43.485
What do you want me to do then?

01:04:45.946 --> 01:04:48.865
There should be a thesis about you two.
You guys are weird.

01:04:49.700 --> 01:04:53.495
I went when I was 20
and when I was 28. I'm worried.

01:04:53.578 --> 01:04:54.496
Is it love?
