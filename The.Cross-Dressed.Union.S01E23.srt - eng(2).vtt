00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.800
Minister Liu, it's not too late to regret now.

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.120
Otherwise, you'll spend your life here.

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.040
Even if I die,

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.800
you, a traitor guilty of treason,

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.440
will never learn the Jade Seal's whereabouts.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.800
Keep a close watch on him.

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:31.680
Qiao Youyi.

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:49.320
Minister Liu.

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.600
Seems I'm truly confused.

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.400
I actually heard

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:00.920
Lord Rui's voice.

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:04.960
Chen Youqi.

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.680
Your ruthless ambition—

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.640
I will record every piece of evidence

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.120
of your crimes, one by one.

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:12.920
When I die,

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:13.440
Minister Liu,

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:16.760
look back and see

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.000
Chen Youqi,

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.400
you're truly a fool.

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:36.560
Lord Rui.

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.040
Why are you dressed like this?

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:43.520
Kneel.

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:55.000
Now,

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.080
you must believe me.

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:58.720
Lord Rui.

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:04.000
You truly are...

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:05.840
Lord Rui.

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:07.320
Yes.

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:13.280
Why have you come here?

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:14.600
The situation is dire.

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:15.760
I'll be brief.

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:17.280
The three kingdoms are at war.

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:20.120
Nan Chenxiao was tasked to quell the chaos.

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:22.920
Your Majesty is praying in Jiaozhou City.

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:25.520
Chen Youqi has betrayed us.

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.440
Take the Jade Seal and rally the border army.

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:30.880
Help him rescue Your Majesty.

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:33.040
Leave this to me.

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:34.240
Thank you, Rui.

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:49.640
Take him away.

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:50.600
Rise.

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:55.760
My lord.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:56.680
My lord.

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:57.280
Liang Jin.

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:58.840
After your accident, there was no news.

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:00.520
I was worried sick.

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:03.600
Luckily, Chenxiao arrived in time.

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:05.760
Don't cry.

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:07.560
See, I'm fine.

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:17.320
Did Chongming Daren

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:19.360
return with the general as well?

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:25.680
Chongming Daren

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:28.160
stayed to escort the people out.

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:30.800
He defended Pingxiang City to the end.

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:33.440
He...

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:36.920
won't be coming back.

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:57.680
Let's go.

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:51.160
Junior Brother.

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:53.640
I am here to save Your Majesty.

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:11.920
Junior Brother.

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:12.920
Your Majesty, are you alright?

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:13.640
I'm fine.

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:17.920
I was misled.

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:19.400
How innocent I was.

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:23.200
We shouldn't stay here long.

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:24.720
Your Majesty, please come with me.

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:28.680
Careful.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:33.840
Chenxiao.

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:39.040
Junior Brother.

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:39.680
General Nan.

00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:42.600
Chenxiao.

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:45.000
Youyi.

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:45.960
Chenxiao.

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:51.680
Chenxiao, are you alright?

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:52.680
Yu'er.

00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:53.400
Chenxiao.

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:55.720
This time, the injury

00:08:57.920 --> 00:08:58.840
is quite serious.

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:00.440
It's fine.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.080
I brought medicine.

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:03.480
I can heal you.

00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:05.920
The Military Imperial Examination will soon be implemented.

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:08.120
Our mission is nearly complete.

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:10.840
You can't, you can't...

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:15.440
My greatest regret in life

00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:21.080
is not marrying you into the Nan family.

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:26.240
Yu'er.

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:28.680
Will you

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:31.560
marry me?

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:33.840
I will.

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:36.640
Of course I will.

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:38.840
It's alright.

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:48.320
Chenxiao.

00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:51.960
Chenxiao.

00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:56.960
Chenxiao.

00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:00.560
Chenxiao.

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:07.040
Why the panic?

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:08.600
Ling An.

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:10.280
Ling An's reinforcements have arrived.

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:11.800
What did you say?

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:14.360
King Wurong is helping Nan Chenxiao defend the gate.

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:16.280
Rui Wang led the Ling'an Army

00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:17.760
and broke through.

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:21.440
What about Hongli Island's reinforcements?

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:23.720
We just need to wait for Hongli Island.

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:26.600
Has Lord of Hongli Island replied?

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:28.600
No.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:33.800
Why?

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:36.640
Was it you?

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:39.840
Did you fail to deliver the letter?

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:42.760
You dare betray me!

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:43.560
Prince.

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:46.600
While Hongli Island was negotiating alliance with us,

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:48.920
they sent a peace proposal to Ling An.

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:50.040
They seek peace and marriage alliance.

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:51.280
And Ling An

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:52.600
agreed.

00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:56.280
Impossible.

00:10:57.800 --> 00:10:58.960
Impossible.

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:11.360
He wants to marry into Ling An.

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:14.320
I won't let him get his way.

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:17.280
As long as Ling An knows he conspired with me,

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:18.040
then...

00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:30.040
So,

00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:32.760
it was you.

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:23.400
Pavilion Master.

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:25.680
The Qianyuan Army abandoned camp and fled.

00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:29.680
Gather everything from the Qianyuan camp.

00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:31.080
Confiscate it all.

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:32.440
Leave nothing behind.

00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:34.400
Yes, I'll do it at once.

00:12:58.920 --> 00:12:59.720
Master Yu.

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:09.960
Master Yu.

00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:12.040
How is Chenxiao?

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:16.240
I've done all I can.

00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:21.320
His old wounds haven't healed.

00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:22.560
Now he's suffered another blow.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.720
His life is saved for now,

00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:29.920
but when he'll wake up

00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:32.440
depends on his fate.

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:43.400
Thank you, Master Yu.

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:45.200
Please, rise quickly.

00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:49.360
Thank you for your help, Master Yu.

00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:52.360
Then I'll take him back today.

00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:52.880
No.

00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:57.160
He needs rest.

00:13:57.560 --> 00:13:58.520
He must not be moved.

00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:00.000
Alright.

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:02.680
Then I'll stay here with him.

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:20.040
Such deep devotion.

00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:25.040
Don't worry.

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:27.760
What we set out to do

00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:29.760
will surely be accomplished.

00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:32.000
Those who harmed you

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:35.720
will pay the price in the end.

00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:47.520
I'll wait for you.

00:14:58.040 --> 00:14:59.200
Over here, Your Majesty.

00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:05.120
Greetings, Your Majesty.

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:11.440
You have always stood in court

00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:12.880
opposing my policies.

00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:15.560
You refused to let generals hold power.

00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:17.760
I never held it against you.

00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:20.200
How dare you

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:22.880
harbor thoughts of treason?

00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:28.680
Treason.

00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:31.520
Treason.

00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:35.240
It was a moment's lapse.

00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:37.120
That led to a grave mistake.

00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:40.760
I only wanted to give Wanwan

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:43.120
a good future.

00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:44.520
If she marries into Qian Yuan

00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:48.120
without proper dowry or family status,

00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:49.720
how could she...

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:54.760
My crime is unforgivable.

00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:58.440
But Wanwan is loyal to you.

00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:01.080
All the fault

00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:04.880
is due to my greed.

00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:07.760
Wanwan knows nothing of this.

00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:11.680
I beg Your Majesty

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.720
to spare Wanwan's life.

00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:20.480
Please don't send her to Qian Yuan.

00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:27.120
I promise you,

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.600
she will have a good future.

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:32.080
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:38.800
For your great kindness.

00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:45.800
All my ministers,

00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:47.960
You may rise.

00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:50.320
Speak if you have matters.

00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:51.760
If not,

00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:53.760
court is dismissed.

00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:57.320
Greetings, Your Majesty.

00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:00.120
May Your Majesty's fortune be boundless.

00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:01.840
May your life be as high as the heavens.

00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:03.720
Good.

00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:08.920
Good.

00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:12.880
Prince.

00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:14.400
The spy has left.

00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:20.800
Good.

00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:23.320
Everyone,

00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:26.440
follow me from now on.

00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:28.280
Be loyal and devoted.

00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:32.040
You will be richly rewarded daily.

00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:23.200
I, Ming Wanwan,

00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:24.600
greet Your Majesty.

00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:25.440
You may rise.

00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:27.240
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:32.880
I wish to ask Your Majesty

00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:34.440
to let me marry for alliance.

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:37.000
To save the lives of my family.

00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:40.440
My father committed the grave crime of treason.

00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:42.400
I do not seek to clear his name.

00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:44.720
But my family is innocent.

00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:46.920
They knew nothing of his schemes.

00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:50.560
Please spare their lives.

00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:52.440
You wish to sacrifice yourself

00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:54.120
to save your family?

00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:56.520
Yes.

00:18:57.440 --> 00:18:59.080
Please grant my request.

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:06.120
Your Majesty.

00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:09.480
The Queen Mother has adopted you.

00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:11.320
You are now Princess of Ling An.

00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:13.760
But right now,

00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:15.720
Qian Yuan and Ling An are at odds.

00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:17.680
You are my sworn sister.

00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:19.920
I wish to give you a better future.

00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:24.280
I remember

00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:25.880
at the envoy banquet

00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:28.840
you met King Wurong.

00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:30.600
He is of noble character.

00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:32.640
A man worthy of trust.

00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:34.000
Rest assured.

00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:36.080
Ling An will support you.

00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:38.080
If you marry into Wu Rong,

00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:40.200
your life will be easier.

00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:49.960
Thank you, Imperial Brother,

00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:51.680
for granting my wish.

00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:53.960
Rise.

00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:09.880
I

00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:11.440
act on Your Majesty's orders.

00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:12.920
All border officials who colluded

00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:16.400
with Qian Yuan and took bribes are arrested.

00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:17.240
I

00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:19.120
have organized the case files.

00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:19.960
Please

00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:21.800
review them, Your Majesty.

00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:35.240
Your Majesty.

00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:43.920
Your Majesty.

00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:46.520
Pingxiang and Qian Yuan sent national letters.

00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:49.400
Their envoys arrived in the capital yesterday.

00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:51.120
The Pingxiang rebellion is quelled.

00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:53.840
Qian Yuan has demoted Prince Pan Zi Zhai

00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:55.200
to commoner.

00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:57.880
They now seek peace.

00:20:58.160 --> 00:20:58.680
Willing

00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:00.640
to honor Ling An as the superior state.

00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:02.240
They will pay tribute every year.

00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:03.880
And offer gifts annually.

00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:08.920
In quelling the Pingxiang Regent Hou Qi's rebellion,

00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:10.920
Grand General Nan Hongyi

00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:12.080
was indispensable.

00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:12.880
Thus,

00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:14.480
merits and faults are balanced.

00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:16.560
I will not pursue the Nan family's

00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:17.800
offense of deceiving the throne.

00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:21.600
Thank you for Your Majesty's pardon.

00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:28.160
Rise.

00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:37.120
I plan to waive the hostage princes' entry.

00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:39.200
May this foster peace among nations.

00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:41.840
Bless our people with a century of peace.

00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:43.440
This time,

00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:44.840
Ling An has overcome hardship.

00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:47.040
I am grateful for heaven's protection.

00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:48.440
With loyal ministers within,

00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:49.800
and great generals without,

00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:51.080
I have decided

00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:52.640
to grant a general amnesty.

00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:55.240
The exiled generals from sixteen years ago

00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:57.320
and their families may return home

00:21:57.680 --> 00:21:58.480
Those who have proven themselves

00:21:58.640 --> 00:21:59.840
may re-enter official service

00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:01.800
Grand General Nan Hongyi will remain

00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:03.560
as the chief examiner

00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:05.160
to implement the Military Imperial Examination

00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:07.400
Your Majesty is wise and enlightened

00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:09.120
Chenxiao

00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:10.800
You led the way with courage

00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:12.120
risking your own safety

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:15.080
and finally won a bright future for the generals

00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:17.120
The injustices of the past

00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:19.440
can finally be set right

00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:23.240
Your Majesty

00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:25.760
There is one more who deserves reward

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:26.720
Indeed

00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:30.160
Rui Yu, Second-Rank Scholar of Hanlin Academy

00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:32.960
ventured alone to the enemy camp to persuade surrender

00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:34.960
and uncovered Qian Yuan's

00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:37.400
hidden spies in our border cities

00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:38.840
Her contributions are invaluable

00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:40.160
Rui Yu

00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:42.120
You went on a solo diplomatic mission

00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:43.480
fearless in the face of danger

00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:44.680
ready to sacrifice your life

00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:45.680
Your merit is undeniable

00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:46.840
I

00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:48.560
grant you a special privilege

00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:49.960
What reward do you desire

00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:51.040
Name it yourself

00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:03.760
I

00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:05.120
Rui Yu

00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:07.440
was born in the forty-fifth year of Ankang

00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:09.000
and was fortunate

00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:11.240
to serve Your Majesty since childhood

00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:13.080
and finally earned recognition at court

00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:14.560
receiving the title of Grand Secretary

00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:16.520
However

00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:20.400
I carry a secret unknown to others

00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:22.080
Now

00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:24.000
the court is stable

00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:25.560
and the wars have ended

00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:28.120
I dare not claim credit

00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:29.720
But I

00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:31.760
wish to confess to Your Majesty

00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:33.400
and reveal the truth

00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:35.920
seeking Your Majesty's forgiveness

00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:39.080
For your achievements this time

00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:41.800
I will not blame you for anything

00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:48.760
I

00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:51.840
am, in truth, a woman

00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:53.280
Th-this...

00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:55.120
Lord Rui Yu is actually a woman

00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:24.000
Greetings, Your Majesty

00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:37.160
You handled border affairs as soon as you returned

00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:39.200
You have worked hard

00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:41.560
This is all

00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:42.920
my duty

00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:46.280
Pingxiang has sent envoys to negotiate peace

00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:47.960
They will arrive in the capital soon

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:50.040
As for Qian Yuan

00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:52.960
Pan Zi Zhai colluded with Qian Yuan

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:54.520
and disrupted the balance of the three states

00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:57.160
causing Ling An to lose good generals

00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:01.280
Qian Yuan wishes to downplay this matter

00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:03.560
Such wishful thinking is delusional

00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:05.080
Your Majesty

00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:06.920
I wish to send troops against Qian Yuan

00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:09.760
to honor the fallen and restore our prestige

00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:12.920
Your Majesty

00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:14.760
The war has just ended

00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:17.200
Countless people have lost their homes

00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:18.960
The borders need rebuilding

00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:20.920
We must not stir up trouble again

00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:24.960
As a general, Chenxiao

00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:27.120
surely hopes the nation values martial strength

00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:28.880
and that generals can return to the battlefield

00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:30.040
to defend the borders

00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:33.440
but they do not wish for more wars

00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:35.360
that exhaust the people and drain resources

00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:42.800
Qian Yuan has demoted Pan Zi Zhai to commoner

00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:44.520
Spies from the Hidden Pavilion report

00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:46.560
Pan Zi Zhai cannot accept reality

00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:47.720
and has become deranged

00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:49.880
He has received his due retribution

00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:52.640
We should restore friendly relations

00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:54.480
and let the border cities

00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:56.760
have a chance to recover

00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:01.520
If so

00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:03.280
then I

00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:04.640
will show leniency

00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:06.280
and instruct Sifang Guest House

00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:12.440
to pardon Qian Yuan's offenses

00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:15.000
but postwar reparations must not be reduced

00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:17.760
Yes

00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:21.040
For your achievements this time

00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:22.080
at tomorrow's morning court

00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:23.400
I will grant you a reward

00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:25.480
Your Majesty

00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:28.880
I have a matter

00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:30.760
to discuss with you

00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:32.360
Speak

00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:35.800
I

00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:37.800
wish to confess at tomorrow's court

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:40.960
that I am, in fact, a woman

00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:47.360
You and Nan Chenxiao have achieved great merit

00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:49.680
and both have bright futures ahead

00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:53.680
Why do you suddenly wish to resign

00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:56.560
Chenxiao

00:26:56.800 --> 00:26:58.400
to quell the Pingxiang rebellion

00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:00.600
chose to resume his male identity

00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:02.640
I, for the sake of our nations

00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:03.880
went to Qian Yuan as envoy

00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:05.840
and faced life and death

00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:09.400
which made me realize life is short

00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:12.200
winning someone's heart is truly rare

00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:13.920
Now

00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:15.720
the three states are at peace

00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:17.320
the people live in comfort

00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:19.160
civil and military relations are improving

00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:20.360
Everything

00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:22.560
is thriving and prosperous

00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:24.680
I

00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:27.200
wish to be myself again

00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:29.720
and live my own life

00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:34.320
If Ling An ever needs me

00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:36.520
even without the title of Lord Rui

00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:39.160
Rui Yu will still give my all

00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:51.840
You and Nan Chenxiao are my most trusted aides

00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:04.200
I do not wish to see such talent hidden away

00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:13.800
But I see your feelings for each other

00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:16.160
Enough

00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:17.280
I

00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:19.240
will help you fulfill your wishes

00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:22.120
Minister Liu is upright and honest

00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:23.480
He may succeed the position

00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:25.640
and continue to serve Your Majesty

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:28.840
To have such loyal ministers

00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:30.560
is my honor

00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:33.320
and Ling An's great fortune

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:35.840
Sixteen years

00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:37.840
have passed in the blink of an eye

00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:40.480
Lord Rui

00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:42.320
has accompanied Your Majesty

00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:44.640
all the way to this moment

00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:19.600
My lords,

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:21.520
if you have something to say, speak plainly.

00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:25.440
Your Majesty,

00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:26.760
in my opinion,

00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:28.480
as Rui Yu's

00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:29.960
mentor,

00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:31.840
I wish to speak a fair word for her.

00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:33.440
Though she is a woman,

00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:34.560
yet

00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:35.880
she surpasses many men

00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:38.160
in wisdom and courage.

00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:40.720
In learning, she can debate scholars

00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:41.960
and turn the tide.

00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:42.880
In courage,

00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:44.920
she can enter enemy lines

00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:46.960
to buy time for our army

00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:48.320
and gather intelligence.

00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:49.880
Therefore,

00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:50.880
I

00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:52.840
I earnestly ask you all

00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:55.640
to recognize Rui Yu's achievements.

00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:04.920
Your Majesty,

00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:10.360
I know well

00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:12.840
that after revealing the truth, I should not remain at court.

00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:14.840
I also beg Your Majesty

00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:16.760
to absolve the Rui family of guilt.

00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:21.400
Peace in the realm

00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:24.080
is partly thanks to you.

00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:26.320
How could I blame you?

00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:28.360
Since that is so,

00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:30.400
Rui Yu is hereby removed

00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:33.080
from the post of Second-Rank Scholar of the Hanlin Academy.

00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:35.840
Minister Liu will take the position.

00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:39.480
As a commoner,

00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:42.640
I thank Your Majesty for your grace.

00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:48.040
Rise.

00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:06.560
Master,

00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:08.400
Master,

00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:09.600
Lord Rui has returned!

00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:11.040
Good, good!

00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:12.120
Take me there.

00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:13.320
I want to greet them myself.

00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:14.000
Alright.

00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:26.320
Madam,

00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:27.720
what's wrong?

00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:32.560
I am Zi Zhai's aunt.

00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:34.480
Zi Zhai

00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:36.040
has committed such a grave crime.

00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:38.760
I truly don't know how to face you all now.

00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:39.480
Madam,

00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:41.320
you married into the Rui Residence,

00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:42.840
caring for everyone here.

00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:43.480
Father,

00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:44.440
Second and third brother,

00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:47.120
all praise your virtue and kindness.

00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:49.120
You joined our Rui family,

00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:50.560
so you are one of us now.

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:53.400
You have no ties to those from Qian Yuan anymore.

00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:56.240
If there were any doubts about you,

00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:58.960
Father would not have told you Yu'er's true identity.

00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:03.120
By the way,

00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:05.360
speaking of little Yu,

00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:07.120
I'm still confused.

00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:08.480
They told me

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:10.840
that little Yu is actually a girl.

00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:12.360
Before, they said

00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:13.240
that

00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:15.240
Chenxiao is a man.

00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:18.400
Why is your family so mixed up?

00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:20.320
The two of them are just

00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:23.360
swapped, aren't they?

00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:25.440
It doesn't really make a difference.

00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:27.480
Alright,

00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:29.400
from now on,

00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:32.000
let's just live well together.

00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:54.760
Now that the world is at peace,

00:32:55.120 --> 00:32:57.200
you no longer need to hide in the mountains.

00:32:58.200 --> 00:32:59.360
Go down,

00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:01.120
and return to your Jiangcheng Mansion.

00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:04.640
If Master hadn't saved us back then,

00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:06.120
we wouldn't have had the chance

00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:07.360
to see this prosperous age.

00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:08.560
Master's great kindness

00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:10.200
we disciples will never forget.

00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:16.040
I have taught you all my skills.

00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:19.120
Remember,

00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:22.880
after you leave, don't cause any trouble.

00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:25.920
I can't afford to lose face as your teacher.

00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:30.480
You must remember my teachings.

00:33:31.560 --> 00:33:32.960
Hold on to your original purpose.

00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:35.720
Be like your senior Nan Chenxiao,

00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:40.360
a good general who protects the nation and its people.

00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:41.840
Yes, Master.

00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:46.240
Master,

00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:47.320
take care.

00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:52.480
My lord,

00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:53.840
My lord,

00:33:54.120 --> 00:33:55.560
General Fu will return to the capital soon, right?

00:33:55.720 --> 00:33:56.600
Is everything arranged?

00:33:57.360 --> 00:33:59.960
Don't worry, General Nan has arranged everything for us.

00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:02.080
He even helped us get a house.

00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:04.760
Now that you've regained your status,

00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:06.520
you don't need to do this work anymore.

00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:08.520
It's fine.

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:10.480
I'll serve you a few more days.

00:34:10.680 --> 00:34:12.160
Once the young master recovers,

00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:13.600
and my family returns to the capital,

00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:14.720
then

00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:16.560
I can go home with peace of mind.

00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:22.360
What is this?

00:34:28.120 --> 00:34:29.840
The young master prepared this for you.

00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:32.240
He has been waiting for the day you regained your status.
