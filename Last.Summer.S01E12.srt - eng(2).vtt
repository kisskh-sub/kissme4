Dear Your Honor.

00:00:51.197 --> 00:00:52.031
Hello.

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:56.452
I'm Song Ha-gyeong, the plaintiff
in the co-owned property case.

00:00:57.036 --> 00:00:59.330
How familiar are you with Pacheon?

00:00:59.414 --> 00:01:01.749
You may not be familiar with it at all.

00:01:03.877 --> 00:01:06.254
I haven't met anyone in the legal field
who lives here.

00:01:06.337 --> 00:01:07.213
What's going on?

00:01:07.297 --> 00:01:08.173
The battery's dead.

00:01:08.256 --> 00:01:09.924
Maybe because we're near the DMZ.

00:01:10.008 --> 00:01:10.884
Let's take the bus.

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:12.552
People believe Pacheon

00:01:12.635 --> 00:01:15.638
would be the first place to be hit
if a war ever started.

00:01:15.722 --> 00:01:20.310
Hey!

00:01:20.435 --> 00:01:23.688
But for me,
every single day already feels like a war.

00:01:26.774 --> 00:01:28.276
The bus is here!

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:30.778
I should probably introduce Bus 18.

00:01:30.862 --> 00:01:33.573
It comes every 40 minutes,
stops at five villages and has…

00:01:33.656 --> 00:01:34.741
Wait!

00:01:34.824 --> 00:01:36.242
…only 18 seats.

00:01:36.326 --> 00:01:37.285
You get on first.

00:01:37.368 --> 00:01:39.120
Hang on. Hurry!

00:01:39.203 --> 00:01:44.167
I had to throw myself onto the road
just to catch the bus.

00:01:45.877 --> 00:01:46.878
You are a natural.

00:01:46.961 --> 00:01:49.756
The place where I had to risk my life
every day to get to school

00:01:50.506 --> 00:01:54.052
is Pacheon's northernmost area,
Patan-myeon.

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:58.139
I really hate Patan-myeon.

00:01:58.223 --> 00:02:00.433
For the past 17 years,
Patan-myeon has slowly

00:02:00.516 --> 00:02:02.685
shaped me into
a pretty wrecked human being.

00:02:02.769 --> 00:02:04.395
Ms. Song, am I doing this right?

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:08.650
They insisted that construction
be part of the design.

00:02:08.733 --> 00:02:11.361
Then they went with the cheapest builder.

00:02:11.444 --> 00:02:13.321
Are you listening to me?

00:02:13.404 --> 00:02:15.573
-I miss you.
-Me too.

00:02:18.201 --> 00:02:20.453
A place you can't reach in summer
because of floods

00:02:20.536 --> 00:02:23.206
and in winter, because of snowstorms.

00:02:23.289 --> 00:02:24.123
PETITION LETTER

00:02:24.207 --> 00:02:29.462
This awful place keeps taking away
everything I care about.

00:02:30.838 --> 00:02:32.840
Now I'm even imagining things.

00:02:33.424 --> 00:02:34.467
You're up.

00:02:35.093 --> 00:02:36.844
-Yes.
-What are you doing?

00:02:36.928 --> 00:02:39.681
I, Song Ha-gyeong, the plaintiff,
am losing my mind.

00:02:39.764 --> 00:02:40.682
Hey.

00:02:40.765 --> 00:02:42.934
What the heck? Why are you reading this?

00:02:43.017 --> 00:02:45.520
Hey, this is no petition letter.

00:02:45.603 --> 00:02:46.813
It's a love letter.

00:02:48.064 --> 00:02:48.982
As if.

00:02:49.857 --> 00:02:53.486
Ha-gyeong,
you've been crazy about me every summer.

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:57.490
You think
I'm only crazy about you in summer?

00:02:58.116 --> 00:02:58.950
Think again.

00:03:00.952 --> 00:03:02.286
Of course, winter's included.

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:06.749
Hurry up or we'll be late.

00:03:07.333 --> 00:03:10.378
Right, we should go to Hawaii.
Get ready already.

00:03:11.462 --> 00:03:13.965
-Okay. What are you going to wear?
-I'll go with…

00:03:22.807 --> 00:03:23.808
Aloha.

00:03:23.891 --> 00:03:25.560
-Aloha.
-Aloha.

00:03:27.854 --> 00:03:30.648
This temperature, humidity,

00:03:31.649 --> 00:03:32.525
and the wind.

00:03:32.608 --> 00:03:34.610
It's a perfect summer.

00:03:45.038 --> 00:03:46.748
Who knew Seoul had a place like this?

00:03:46.831 --> 00:03:48.499
It's winter, but it feels like summer.

00:03:50.168 --> 00:03:53.046
I'm finally having a proper weekend
after months.

00:03:54.088 --> 00:03:56.841
Isn't it nice spending winter with me?
I handle events so well.

00:03:57.675 --> 00:04:00.178
Event? What's the occasion today?

00:04:00.261 --> 00:04:01.346
Today is

00:04:02.221 --> 00:04:04.932
the 120th day since you confessed to me.

00:04:05.016 --> 00:04:05.933
What?

00:04:06.684 --> 00:04:09.771
So then,
it's been 120 days since our first kiss.

00:04:10.813 --> 00:04:14.317
Our first kiss was on the fence,
so it's been 3,805 days.

00:04:15.276 --> 00:04:17.570
That was our first peck.
It's been 120 days.

00:04:20.531 --> 00:04:23.910
Why don't we check
all special occasions in winter?

00:04:24.494 --> 00:04:25.787
All 20 years at once?

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:28.414
I'm in.

00:04:28.498 --> 00:04:30.917
I can't miss the Christmas
and year-end parties.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.335
We'll do New Year's.

00:04:32.418 --> 00:04:34.587
Let's not forget
Su-bak's birthday in winter.

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:35.671
And this day.

00:04:35.755 --> 00:04:38.508
It was when we broke ground
on Peanut House 17 years ago.

00:04:38.591 --> 00:04:40.927
And what about this day?

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:42.136
This day?

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.222
Okay, let's mark this day too.

00:04:44.305 --> 00:04:45.598
What day is it?

00:04:45.681 --> 00:04:47.767
Right. What day is it?

00:04:48.684 --> 00:04:49.685
You really don't know?

00:04:50.395 --> 00:04:52.105
No, what's this day?

00:04:53.648 --> 00:04:54.482
My birthday.

00:05:04.951 --> 00:05:07.453
I totally got you.
That was a nice surprise, right?

00:05:11.249 --> 00:05:14.460
I pretended I totally forgot
to surprise you.

00:05:14.544 --> 00:05:16.045
That's such a cliché.

00:05:17.088 --> 00:05:18.965
Haven't you seen movies or shows?

00:05:22.927 --> 00:05:23.761
Really?

00:05:25.721 --> 00:05:27.682
December 17th is my birthday.

00:05:28.558 --> 00:05:29.642
You remember that?

00:05:29.725 --> 00:05:32.270
Hey, of course. December 17th.

00:05:32.353 --> 00:05:34.814
-Who forgets their boyfriend's birthday?
-Exactly.

00:05:35.773 --> 00:05:37.275
Actually, my birthday

00:05:37.358 --> 00:05:38.818
is December 18th.

00:05:41.154 --> 00:05:42.071
Hey.

00:05:42.155 --> 00:05:43.531
Sure, the 18th.

00:05:43.614 --> 00:05:45.741
I was going to say the 18th.

00:05:48.077 --> 00:05:49.328
Where are you going? Hey!

00:05:54.834 --> 00:05:57.587
Actually, it is the 17th.

00:06:06.387 --> 00:06:07.388
Su-bak.

00:06:07.471 --> 00:06:10.474
She knows your birthday
and this house's birthday.

00:06:10.558 --> 00:06:12.018
She doesn't know my birthday.

00:06:14.312 --> 00:06:17.023
Hey. Didn't you celebrate
your lunar birthday?

00:06:17.106 --> 00:06:18.608
When's my lunar birthday?

00:06:29.535 --> 00:06:30.912
Get out of the way.

00:06:30.995 --> 00:06:31.954
Move.

00:06:33.497 --> 00:06:34.624
Hey.

00:06:34.707 --> 00:06:36.667
The 17th. I will never forget.

00:06:38.753 --> 00:06:41.589
I've got your birthday, okay?

00:06:43.799 --> 00:06:44.634
So tell me.

00:06:45.384 --> 00:06:46.469
What will you do for me?

00:06:47.386 --> 00:06:48.846
I'm Dr. Song of Patan-myeon.

00:06:49.472 --> 00:06:52.725
I've been in charge
of events, parties, and celebrations

00:06:52.808 --> 00:06:55.102
in this town for 17 years.

00:06:57.313 --> 00:06:58.147
Trust me.

00:06:58.898 --> 00:07:01.901
BAEK DO-HA'S BIRTHDAY PARTY PLAN

00:07:09.116 --> 00:07:09.951
SEUNG-TAEK
MR. SHIN

00:07:10.034 --> 00:07:11.953
Mr. Baek, what does Do-ha like?

00:07:12.036 --> 00:07:13.246
The ash tree?

00:07:13.829 --> 00:07:16.332
I gave him the tree for his birthday.
He loved it.

00:07:16.415 --> 00:07:18.417
He's 29 now.

00:07:18.501 --> 00:07:19.710
DO-HA'S DAD

00:07:19.794 --> 00:07:22.255
This is bad. You didn't know either?

00:07:22.338 --> 00:07:25.550
Speaking of which, you missed
his middle school entrance ceremony too.

00:07:25.633 --> 00:07:29.095
Yes, it overlapped with my
faculty appointment ceremony. Why?

00:07:29.178 --> 00:07:31.055
Ms. Nam, have a conscience, please!

00:07:31.138 --> 00:07:32.181
DO-HA'S MOM

00:07:32.265 --> 00:07:35.393
In the States,
you hire a stripper for a party…

00:07:36.102 --> 00:07:37.311
YOON SO-HEE

00:07:47.196 --> 00:07:50.074
ENJOY 30% OFF YOUR STAY
AT GRAND ROYAL PALACE HOTEL

00:08:05.006 --> 00:08:08.092
Happy birthday to you

00:08:08.175 --> 00:08:11.262
Happy birthday to you

00:08:11.345 --> 00:08:15.391
Happy birthday dear Do-ha

00:08:15.474 --> 00:08:17.935
Happy birthday to you

00:08:27.653 --> 00:08:30.156
Are you ready
for the best birthday ever?

00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:32.116
-Yes.
-Let's go.

00:08:40.333 --> 00:08:43.919
I put all my lectures and meetings
on hold today

00:08:44.003 --> 00:08:45.588
to celebrate my boy's birthday.

00:08:45.671 --> 00:08:46.756
Why?

00:08:46.839 --> 00:08:48.341
But you didn't say anything.

00:08:48.424 --> 00:08:49.592
You invited me.

00:08:49.675 --> 00:08:53.095
You made all the calls
and told me to have a conscience.

00:08:53.179 --> 00:08:54.639
I appreciate the thought, Mom.

00:08:54.722 --> 00:08:56.641
Dad!

00:08:57.850 --> 00:09:00.061
We have a really important plan.

00:09:00.144 --> 00:09:02.521
Right. We were just about to head out.

00:09:03.439 --> 00:09:07.860
Guys, I even canceled my flight.
Come in.

00:09:07.943 --> 00:09:09.153
Come on in.

00:09:09.236 --> 00:09:11.238
Come in! This is going to be fun!

00:09:11.322 --> 00:09:13.574
Come in. Come in.

00:09:19.914 --> 00:09:21.207
Hold on.

00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:23.084
The hotel check-in isn't until later.

00:09:23.167 --> 00:09:25.836
Okay, let's do round one of the party
and go right after.

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:28.005
-If we go before rush hour--
-Son!

00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:30.174
Hurry up.

00:09:30.257 --> 00:09:31.592
Okay, coming.

00:09:31.676 --> 00:09:32.802
Hurry.

00:09:35.054 --> 00:09:35.888
Let's go.

00:09:47.692 --> 00:09:48.526
Dad.

00:09:59.036 --> 00:10:00.955
You almost gave me a heart attack.

00:10:01.831 --> 00:10:02.665
Sorry.

00:10:03.249 --> 00:10:05.459
You and Do-ha were talking about
something serious.

00:10:07.878 --> 00:10:09.004
Did Mr. Baek call you?

00:10:10.339 --> 00:10:11.424
Before that…

00:10:13.843 --> 00:10:15.428
I wanted to see you.

00:10:16.804 --> 00:10:17.638
I just

00:10:18.305 --> 00:10:21.600
wanted to sneak a peek
at my daughter's face.

00:10:23.561 --> 00:10:27.231
Why sneak a peek? You promised
you wouldn't be like a water deer.

00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:30.234
Come over.

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:32.445
Let's go inside.

00:10:33.779 --> 00:10:34.613
Okay.

00:10:38.033 --> 00:10:40.327
It's here.

00:10:42.079 --> 00:10:45.416
How do you like the wrapping?
It feels like a birthday gift, right?

00:10:45.499 --> 00:10:46.834
It feels like a wedding gift.

00:10:48.669 --> 00:10:50.379
GOPCHANG

00:10:56.802 --> 00:10:58.763
Now you even want to take a picture?

00:11:01.182 --> 00:11:02.183
Let's eat.

00:11:09.690 --> 00:11:10.816
It's good.

00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:11.901
So good.

00:11:14.195 --> 00:11:15.029
Is it good?

00:11:16.071 --> 00:11:17.740
Everyone, let's have a toast.

00:11:18.407 --> 00:11:19.241
Cheers.

00:11:29.126 --> 00:11:31.504
This looks a lot different
since last time.

00:11:33.255 --> 00:11:35.466
Living with you turned my son into a mess.

00:11:36.675 --> 00:11:40.012
-Ms. Nam.
-You keep calling me "Ms. Nam."

00:11:40.095 --> 00:11:42.765
How am I supposed to treat you
as my daughter-in-law?

00:11:42.848 --> 00:11:45.684
We're not there yet.
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

00:11:47.186 --> 00:11:48.020
You go downstairs.

00:11:56.403 --> 00:11:58.822
I love her rude attitude.

00:11:58.906 --> 00:12:02.701
I'm actually grateful to her
for turning you into a mess.

00:12:02.785 --> 00:12:04.662
Are you feeling relieved now?

00:12:05.454 --> 00:12:07.289
So you should stop.

00:12:07.373 --> 00:12:08.958
Why are you so worried?

00:12:09.792 --> 00:12:13.212
I'm just
pretending to be Mom for once.

00:12:15.130 --> 00:12:17.049
It feels like home now.

00:12:18.884 --> 00:12:22.221
The vitamin bottle with the sleeping pills
is gone too.

00:12:22.638 --> 00:12:25.975
I got rid of it.
I got a better sleeping aid.

00:12:37.695 --> 00:12:38.654
What's all this?

00:12:40.573 --> 00:12:41.782
Why's there so much?

00:12:43.158 --> 00:12:47.162
I kept buying one
each time I missed you.

00:12:48.831 --> 00:12:52.960
"I'll give it to her next winter.
She gets cold easily.

00:12:53.669 --> 00:12:56.797
I'll give them to her next time."
I kept buying them like that.

00:13:04.763 --> 00:13:07.433
They're tacky, but they're warm.

00:13:07.516 --> 00:13:08.517
Really?

00:13:19.111 --> 00:13:20.779
HA-GYEONG, HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

00:13:30.956 --> 00:13:32.333
HA-GYEONG, HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

00:13:32.458 --> 00:13:35.002
You've been carrying all these all along?

00:13:39.548 --> 00:13:40.466
I'm sorry…

00:13:43.594 --> 00:13:45.262
for being such a lousy dad.

00:13:47.014 --> 00:13:48.599
I haven't found the answer.

00:13:48.682 --> 00:13:50.434
It doesn't work that fast.

00:13:50.517 --> 00:13:52.686
It took me this long
to be able to hold hands.

00:13:54.605 --> 00:13:57.775
Next time, come back on my birthday,
not Do-ha's.

00:13:57.858 --> 00:14:00.402
Give me gifts and cards
like these directly.

00:14:08.661 --> 00:14:10.871
Ji-cheol. Song Ji-cheol.

00:14:11.455 --> 00:14:14.083
-Mr. Baek is calling you.
-Okay.

00:14:17.836 --> 00:14:18.671
Let's go, Dad.

00:14:22.967 --> 00:14:23.926
Come on.

00:14:26.595 --> 00:14:30.516
Is this supposed to be a shaman's house?
There are so many colors.

00:14:31.892 --> 00:14:33.686
You did this, right?

00:14:35.062 --> 00:14:36.271
That's Ji-cheol's pick.

00:14:39.274 --> 00:14:40.818
That looks like a new rug.

00:14:41.902 --> 00:14:43.779
Su-bak tore it up, so we got a new one.

00:14:45.531 --> 00:14:49.743
Song Ha-gyeong once said that this house

00:14:50.786 --> 00:14:52.121
was a very selfish,

00:14:53.038 --> 00:14:55.874
yet caring place,
built due to the adults' needs.

00:14:57.167 --> 00:14:58.460
You changed the lighting too.

00:14:59.545 --> 00:15:01.630
Song Ha-gyeong said her eyes hurt.

00:15:01.714 --> 00:15:05.134
With new owners,
the house has transformed.

00:15:06.176 --> 00:15:07.761
It feels like a new era.

00:15:10.973 --> 00:15:12.683
She said it was a complete mess

00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:15.728
built by the Baeks without a mom

00:15:16.395 --> 00:15:17.855
and the Songs without money.

00:15:18.439 --> 00:15:21.567
What makes this house special is
how it changes with the people in it.

00:15:25.154 --> 00:15:27.614
As a professor
at the world's top architecture school,

00:15:27.698 --> 00:15:29.324
this house is a total disaster.

00:15:29.408 --> 00:15:32.369
Who put two houses together like this?

00:15:32.453 --> 00:15:35.372
It lacks aesthetics, but strangely,

00:15:36.123 --> 00:15:37.708
it feels warm and cozy here.

00:15:40.544 --> 00:15:42.755
I think it's because
you're right by the heater.

00:15:44.923 --> 00:15:47.259
No wonder it feels warm. Makes sense.

00:15:47.342 --> 00:15:49.011
But things have changed now.

00:15:49.094 --> 00:15:50.554
The first house
you built back in the day…

00:15:50.637 --> 00:15:52.222
The guest has become the owner…

00:15:53.682 --> 00:15:55.476
…and the owner the guest.

00:15:56.393 --> 00:15:57.603
I guess the house…

00:15:59.271 --> 00:16:02.941
and our relationship
will probably keep evolving.

00:16:03.942 --> 00:16:04.943
By the way,

00:16:06.111 --> 00:16:07.029
my plans…

00:16:08.363 --> 00:16:09.239
My hotel.

00:16:09.323 --> 00:16:13.535
My birthday party. My cake.

00:16:23.837 --> 00:16:25.005
-I'll get going.
-Bye.

00:16:25.089 --> 00:16:25.923
Bye.

00:16:34.098 --> 00:16:37.810
Come again…
even if you don't find an answer.

00:16:39.144 --> 00:16:40.437
The passcode hasn't changed.

00:16:50.322 --> 00:16:51.281
Bye.

00:16:51.782 --> 00:16:52.699
Okay.

00:16:58.330 --> 00:16:59.206
Take care.

00:16:59.289 --> 00:17:00.290
Bye.

00:17:00.374 --> 00:17:01.208
Take care.

00:17:01.291 --> 00:17:02.543
-Bye.
-Next time, call first.

00:17:02.626 --> 00:17:03.460
I won't.

00:17:07.631 --> 00:17:10.175
I thought we'd be
checking out of the hotel at this time.

00:17:10.259 --> 00:17:12.636
My parents are checking out
of our place instead.

00:17:15.139 --> 00:17:16.598
It was meaningful in its own way.

00:17:17.516 --> 00:17:18.851
No, Do-ha.

00:17:18.934 --> 00:17:21.103
We still have more than
a dozen events left.

00:17:21.186 --> 00:17:22.146
Right.

00:17:22.813 --> 00:17:25.315
All those days on our calendar
are waiting for us!

00:17:25.399 --> 00:17:26.316
They're waiting!

00:17:29.153 --> 00:17:31.697
DECEMBER 20, SKI DAY

00:17:31.780 --> 00:17:32.656
SAFETY ALERT

00:17:32.739 --> 00:17:33.574
What do we do?

00:17:39.872 --> 00:17:41.748
We don't have to worry about traffic

00:17:41.832 --> 00:17:45.127
or roads closures from snow,
because we're taking the train.

00:17:45.210 --> 00:17:46.587
-You got the tickets?
-Yes.

00:17:46.670 --> 00:17:47.963
DEC 21, SOLSTICE STAR TOUR

00:17:48.046 --> 00:17:48.881
Oh, my.

00:17:49.631 --> 00:17:52.509
Did you forget today was
Patan-myeon's quarterly meeting,

00:17:52.593 --> 00:17:54.428
Dr. Song, Master Baek?

00:17:55.554 --> 00:17:56.722
Su-bak, are you okay?

00:17:56.805 --> 00:17:57.764
DEC 23, MOVIE DAY

00:17:57.848 --> 00:17:58.765
Are you okay?

00:17:58.849 --> 00:17:59.683
SU-BAK CARE DAY

00:17:59.766 --> 00:18:00.976
We won't go anywhere.

00:18:01.059 --> 00:18:04.438
Right. How could we
go anywhere without you?

00:18:05.272 --> 00:18:06.481
It's going to be all right.

00:18:08.609 --> 00:18:09.568
It's okay.

00:18:09.651 --> 00:18:11.695
We still have Christmas left.

00:18:12.905 --> 00:18:15.824
But it feels like
the second we step out of the house,

00:18:15.908 --> 00:18:17.951
everything falls apart.
It's like some curse.

00:18:19.203 --> 00:18:22.247
If that's the case,
should we do it at home?

00:18:23.290 --> 00:18:24.166
A home party?

00:18:24.249 --> 00:18:25.292
Just the two of us?

00:18:25.375 --> 00:18:28.003
Yes. This is our first Christmas together.

00:18:29.588 --> 00:18:31.632
It's quite meaningful.

00:18:33.175 --> 00:18:34.760
-I love it.
-Right?

00:18:38.639 --> 00:18:39.473
I like it.

00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:48.398
SEUL AND SEUNG-TAEK, 486 DAYS IN LOVE

00:18:48.482 --> 00:18:50.692
SEUL AND SEUNG-TAEK,
2-YEAR ANNIVERSARY

00:18:50.776 --> 00:18:53.362
SEUL AND SEUNG-TAEK,
100-DAY ANNIVERSARY

00:18:57.282 --> 00:18:59.451
-Hey, I'm here.
-Oh, hey.

00:19:03.455 --> 00:19:05.332
What are you doing here?

00:19:06.583 --> 00:19:09.962
Did you come here
because you were thinking of me?

00:19:10.045 --> 00:19:12.547
No, I came to have ramyeon.

00:19:14.591 --> 00:19:17.344
I see.
A 12-year history is overwhelming.

00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:21.223
This is my go-to shop.
Be careful not to cross paths.

00:19:21.306 --> 00:19:23.308
Don't you know it's my friend's shop?

00:19:24.309 --> 00:19:26.687
We dated for 12 years.
Your friend is my friend too.

00:19:26.770 --> 00:19:28.355
Go make another friend!

00:19:28.438 --> 00:19:30.482
I like namatamago here.

00:19:31.316 --> 00:19:33.068
Okay. I'll leave.

00:19:33.568 --> 00:19:36.363
Enjoy. I'll come another time.

00:19:36.446 --> 00:19:37.447
Okay, bye.

00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:57.009
How do we happen to meet here?

00:19:57.718 --> 00:19:58.552
Tell me about it.

00:20:03.098 --> 00:20:06.727
I thought we were the most
perfect couple ever back then.

00:20:07.978 --> 00:20:08.854
By the way…

00:20:10.689 --> 00:20:12.816
are you here to see our photo too?

00:20:12.899 --> 00:20:15.694
No. I'll ask them to get rid of it.

00:20:17.279 --> 00:20:18.989
We've been stuck here for too long.

00:20:25.245 --> 00:20:28.623
Good. That's exactly what I wanted.
Do whatever you want!

00:20:55.692 --> 00:20:59.321
Nothing beats home.
Classics are classics for a reason.

00:20:59.404 --> 00:21:02.449
I know.
I feel so calm and relaxed.

00:21:04.326 --> 00:21:07.120
Let's just enjoy ourselves
with no interruptions.

00:21:08.663 --> 00:21:09.498
Sounds good.

00:21:18.048 --> 00:21:19.424
Since we opened,

00:21:19.508 --> 00:21:22.761
the two of you are the only ones
who have come here every Christmas.

00:21:24.346 --> 00:21:25.889
Is your girlfriend running late?

00:21:26.556 --> 00:21:30.477
Would you like me to bring you
the salmon tartare she usually has?

00:21:31.395 --> 00:21:32.646
Actually--

00:21:32.729 --> 00:21:33.939
She's here.

00:21:43.865 --> 00:21:46.785
Aren't you training?
Why do we keep running into each other?

00:21:46.910 --> 00:21:49.079
We see each other
more than when we were together.

00:21:50.539 --> 00:21:53.959
Right back at you.
Why are you at every place I'm going to?

00:21:54.418 --> 00:21:55.877
That feels unfair.

00:21:55.961 --> 00:21:58.171
You think I'm still lurking around you?

00:21:59.131 --> 00:22:01.925
Is this place yours? It's mine too.

00:22:02.008 --> 00:22:03.427
My go-to place for ten years.

00:22:03.510 --> 00:22:05.095
I'm here because I'm a regular too.

00:22:05.178 --> 00:22:07.389
Now that you're here,
I guess I should leave again.

00:22:07.472 --> 00:22:09.558
You ruined this Christmas again!

00:22:10.350 --> 00:22:12.978
-What?
-Every Christmas with you

00:22:13.061 --> 00:22:14.563
has always been like this.

00:22:15.689 --> 00:22:17.649
Seul, I should be the one saying that.

00:22:22.863 --> 00:22:23.947
Let's get married.

00:22:26.533 --> 00:22:28.577
That guy's lines are so cringey.

00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:32.664
Your offhand lines are kind of annoying,

00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:34.457
but somehow better.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.002
Why the rush to get married now?

00:22:37.085 --> 00:22:41.089
Isn't my face a bit more annoying?

00:22:43.341 --> 00:22:45.510
Way too handsome.

00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:47.554
I agree.

00:22:51.683 --> 00:22:53.226
I mean, Do-ha.

00:22:53.310 --> 00:22:56.188
You're way too handsome,
ridiculously so.

00:22:56.271 --> 00:22:57.397
What?

00:22:57.480 --> 00:23:00.150
It wouldn't hurt
if you were ugly for a day.

00:23:00.233 --> 00:23:02.027
Maybe every other day.

00:23:02.736 --> 00:23:05.197
So, it's a bit hard for me.

00:23:11.411 --> 00:23:12.662
What about your eyes?

00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:16.041
Could they sparkle just a little?

00:23:16.791 --> 00:23:18.168
Maybe take a break on holidays.

00:23:19.461 --> 00:23:20.670
It's a bit hard for me too.

00:23:23.173 --> 00:23:27.219
And your smile is so cute,
ridiculously so.

00:23:28.637 --> 00:23:30.055
Why are your hands so warm,

00:23:30.639 --> 00:23:31.723
ridiculously so?

00:23:31.806 --> 00:23:34.601
You're sexy with glasses, sexy without,

00:23:34.684 --> 00:23:36.019
ridiculously so.

00:23:36.102 --> 00:23:38.605
When you get mad, you're so adorable.

00:23:44.778 --> 00:23:48.156
And your eyebrows are so perfect,
ridiculously so.

00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:51.952
Your voice is so incredible,
ridiculously so.

00:23:52.035 --> 00:23:53.745
Why's your nose so pretty…

00:23:55.622 --> 00:23:56.748
and so high?

00:23:56.831 --> 00:23:57.916
Ridiculously so.

00:24:01.586 --> 00:24:03.213
Your eyelashes are…

00:24:05.799 --> 00:24:07.175
so pretty.

00:24:09.302 --> 00:24:10.387
Want to go upstairs?

00:24:19.521 --> 00:24:20.355
What is it?

00:24:23.191 --> 00:24:24.985
Why are you just standing there?

00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:28.697
Who do you think is responsible
for ruining Christmas?

00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:30.198
You two are pros at fighting.

00:24:30.282 --> 00:24:34.202
Let's hear it clearly from the experts
who the culprit is.

00:24:36.413 --> 00:24:37.455
Well…

00:24:37.539 --> 00:24:40.792
It's Christmas.
Can't you just make up and move on?

00:24:42.335 --> 00:24:45.505
Speaking of Christmas,
I remember our first Christmas.

00:24:46.089 --> 00:24:50.302
Because of his super important training,
he stood me up for two hours.

00:24:50.385 --> 00:24:52.846
We have to mention
the following Christmas.

00:24:53.513 --> 00:24:56.599
I bought expensive wine and you said
it tasted awful and went for soju.

00:24:57.976 --> 00:25:00.729
Oh, right.
And the necklace I got you? You lost it.

00:25:00.812 --> 00:25:02.689
Cost me my first paycheck
in the new team.

00:25:02.772 --> 00:25:04.024
Oh, right.

00:25:04.107 --> 00:25:05.775
Remember the Christmas in 2015?

00:25:05.859 --> 00:25:08.611
It was my first Christmas alone
since you were on a trip,

00:25:08.695 --> 00:25:11.656
and you said it wasn't a big deal.

00:25:12.532 --> 00:25:14.534
-You went too far with that.
-Hey.

00:25:14.617 --> 00:25:17.370
That day was when I lost the game
five to zero.

00:25:17.454 --> 00:25:18.330
Look who's talking.

00:25:18.413 --> 00:25:22.208
You said that stupid game
was no big deal to me!

00:25:22.292 --> 00:25:24.002
Seul, you went too far with that.

00:25:26.421 --> 00:25:29.341
And I've spent so many Christmases alone
while you were in Canada!

00:25:29.424 --> 00:25:30.759
Isn't it the same for me?

00:25:30.842 --> 00:25:32.635
I was lonely there being alone.

00:25:32.719 --> 00:25:34.304
That's enough.

00:25:34.387 --> 00:25:36.473
I waited for him
more than 300 days each year.

00:25:36.556 --> 00:25:39.225
And I've never confessed to her
for 12 years.

00:25:39.809 --> 00:25:43.730
I waited through a 17-hour time difference
to talk to you on the phone,

00:25:43.813 --> 00:25:46.149
but you slept the whole damn day!

00:25:46.232 --> 00:25:47.901
The whole damn day?

00:25:47.984 --> 00:25:49.110
Yes, the whole damn day!

00:25:49.194 --> 00:25:52.781
I'd been training nonstop
for 24 hours right before the final.

00:25:53.573 --> 00:25:55.325
Some forget their boyfriend's birthday.

00:25:56.117 --> 00:25:58.578
This guy tests his girlfriend
with his birthday.

00:25:58.661 --> 00:25:59.871
Stay out of this!

00:26:03.917 --> 00:26:06.294
Did we just get kicked
out of our own place?

00:26:07.212 --> 00:26:10.507
By the time we walk around the village,
it should be done, right?

00:26:10.590 --> 00:26:14.177
Twelve years of their story
should be just as long as ours.

00:26:15.762 --> 00:26:16.596
Here.

00:26:22.936 --> 00:26:26.272
-Let's go, Master Baek.
-Let's go, Dr. Song.

00:26:35.031 --> 00:26:36.699
The more I see it, the more I like it.

00:26:41.413 --> 00:26:42.831
Right, it was here.

00:26:44.624 --> 00:26:46.334
This is where my pregnancy rumor began.

00:26:47.877 --> 00:26:48.837
Remember?

00:26:50.922 --> 00:26:53.466
I called you asking for child support.

00:26:53.550 --> 00:26:57.011
If you're going to be a long-distance dad,
do it right.

00:26:57.095 --> 00:26:58.680
Send the child support on time.

00:26:58.763 --> 00:26:59.722
Just hang up!

00:27:06.604 --> 00:27:08.565
The weather's so nice.

00:27:09.357 --> 00:27:11.276
Look. Here come the newlyweds.

00:27:13.153 --> 00:27:17.157
This town is perfect for having kids,

00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:18.825
because there's nothing else to do.

00:27:20.243 --> 00:27:22.537
-Kids these days.
-Right?

00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:25.081
Baek Do-ha! What are you going to do?

00:27:28.168 --> 00:27:29.043
It's okay.

00:27:29.127 --> 00:27:31.254
It all started then.

00:27:33.965 --> 00:27:36.551
-The rumor is still around.
-Still?

00:27:38.261 --> 00:27:41.764
It's okay to hear them now, isn't it?

00:27:43.975 --> 00:27:45.101
What's that face?

00:27:46.686 --> 00:27:49.189
-They've decorated this nicely.
-I know.

00:27:52.567 --> 00:27:56.488
This is where it started.
Our first accomplishment.

00:27:58.823 --> 00:27:59.866
It's mo!

00:27:59.949 --> 00:28:01.034
It's mo!

00:28:01.534 --> 00:28:02.952
-Yay!
-We won!

00:28:03.036 --> 00:28:03.870
It's mo!

00:28:06.247 --> 00:28:09.584
Had we lost, we wouldn't have begun
the fence and observatory projects.

00:28:10.877 --> 00:28:12.754
That game changed a lot of things.

00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:16.049
I can't believe
we're spending Christmas together.

00:28:18.885 --> 00:28:21.471
Every corner of the village
has become a summary of life.

00:28:21.554 --> 00:28:23.723
It's not awful anymore.

00:28:23.806 --> 00:28:27.268
Why do you think I've been waiting
for this day so badly?

00:28:28.770 --> 00:28:31.773
Oh, right.
I wanted to go somewhere with you.

00:28:32.690 --> 00:28:33.525
Where?

00:28:35.276 --> 00:28:37.445
What did you do hanging on this bar?

00:28:38.488 --> 00:28:39.739
I cooled off

00:28:40.490 --> 00:28:44.702
my frustration, anxiety, anger…

00:28:46.412 --> 00:28:47.956
and the longing to see you.

00:28:59.717 --> 00:29:02.053
There's something I've wanted to do
when you do this.

00:29:03.972 --> 00:29:04.806
What is it?

00:29:16.025 --> 00:29:17.485
What was that?

00:29:30.415 --> 00:29:31.249
Su-bak.

00:29:32.041 --> 00:29:33.084
Why are you alone?

00:29:34.043 --> 00:29:36.504
Lee Seul. Oh Seung-taek.

00:29:36.588 --> 00:29:37.505
Did you leave?

00:29:40.758 --> 00:29:41.593
Seung-taek.

00:29:43.344 --> 00:29:44.345
I think they left.

00:29:45.179 --> 00:29:46.097
Oh Seung-taek!

00:29:48.850 --> 00:29:50.602
Did they just leave after fighting?

00:29:50.685 --> 00:29:54.689
Is this house some public property?
Everyone's coming and going as they want.

00:29:57.025 --> 00:29:58.610
Let's put our host duties on pause.

00:29:59.527 --> 00:30:01.154
Let's clean this up tomorrow.

00:30:04.908 --> 00:30:09.078
Another failure.
Pulling off one event is so hard.

00:30:10.997 --> 00:30:13.541
I guess it counted as an event.

00:30:13.625 --> 00:30:16.878
Dr. Song and Master Baek's
Patan-myeon tour.

00:30:16.961 --> 00:30:18.421
It was meaningful in its own way.

00:30:33.645 --> 00:30:36.356
Right. Anniversaries don't really matter.

00:30:36.439 --> 00:30:38.232
What matters is I'm with you

00:30:39.525 --> 00:30:41.694
during winter.

00:30:43.529 --> 00:30:45.865
No. It matters to me.

00:30:45.949 --> 00:30:48.201
I'll make one work.

00:30:48.284 --> 00:30:52.038
Sure. There's still New Year's Eve,

00:30:53.790 --> 00:30:55.208
and the sunrise on January 1st.

00:30:57.085 --> 00:30:58.544
I have to clean up.

00:30:59.879 --> 00:31:02.882
Procrastinating isn't my thing.

00:31:03.383 --> 00:31:04.342
Maybe tomorrow.

00:31:05.927 --> 00:31:07.220
After we wake up…

00:31:09.013 --> 00:31:11.099
let's catch up on everything
we couldn't do.

00:31:11.182 --> 00:31:12.141
Okay.

00:31:15.019 --> 00:31:19.399
There's one more person, so the
house chores should be divided equally.

00:31:32.704 --> 00:31:36.582
SIX MONTHS LATER

00:31:36.666 --> 00:31:38.835
JONG-MAN JR.

00:32:08.281 --> 00:32:09.949
Ha-gyeong, look at this mess.

00:32:13.703 --> 00:32:15.455
I didn't think of this.

00:32:15.538 --> 00:32:18.041
One more person means
three times the chores.

00:32:18.124 --> 00:32:19.459
It's strange.

00:32:19.542 --> 00:32:21.711
I cleaned everything
before my business trip.

00:32:21.794 --> 00:32:24.047
How did this place end up like this
in five days?

00:32:24.130 --> 00:32:25.590
What about you?

00:32:25.673 --> 00:32:27.717
Su-bak's bath is overdue by two days.

00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:30.178
Su-bak's been stinky for two days
because of you!

00:32:32.430 --> 00:32:33.347
Well…

00:32:34.182 --> 00:32:38.019
Because of Professor Hermann's schedule,
the meeting got delayed.

00:32:38.102 --> 00:32:39.312
I had no choice.

00:32:40.063 --> 00:32:41.105
What a lame excuse.

00:32:43.816 --> 00:32:44.650
Hey.

00:32:45.777 --> 00:32:49.822
I told you to separate the colors.
I spent a lot to get that archive edition.

00:32:55.912 --> 00:32:56.871
Are you that upset?

00:32:58.456 --> 00:32:59.457
Is that so?

00:33:00.166 --> 00:33:03.002
Now this T-shirt matters more than me?

00:33:06.380 --> 00:33:08.132
Wait a minute.

00:33:09.342 --> 00:33:10.176
Go.

00:33:10.802 --> 00:33:11.636
Just go.

00:33:12.178 --> 00:33:14.180
You switched the conditioner to rosemary?

00:33:20.394 --> 00:33:21.521
I'm sorry I'm late.

00:33:24.565 --> 00:33:26.484
Let go. I'm going to kill you.

00:33:33.407 --> 00:33:34.617
We haven't met in a while.

00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:37.745
Let's stop being upset
and do what we didn't get to do.

00:33:38.830 --> 00:33:39.831
What didn't we do?

00:33:39.914 --> 00:33:42.792
Seriously, what did we do?
You don't know? I'll let you know.

00:33:43.417 --> 00:33:44.794
-Hey.
-I'll take a quick shower.

00:33:44.877 --> 00:33:46.379
-Hang on a bit.
-Hey, forget it!

00:33:53.803 --> 00:33:54.679
What's wrong?

00:33:57.807 --> 00:33:59.892
-Nothing.
-Aren't you feeling well?

00:34:01.686 --> 00:34:02.770
I'm okay. Go wash up.

00:34:03.896 --> 00:34:04.730
Okay.

00:34:19.412 --> 00:34:21.414
It's endless.

00:34:31.257 --> 00:34:32.175
KIM DA-YE

00:34:32.258 --> 00:34:33.176
At this hour?

00:34:34.468 --> 00:34:35.344
Hi, Da-ye.

00:34:36.345 --> 00:34:39.599
Ha-gyeong's not feeling well.

00:34:39.682 --> 00:34:41.225
If it can wait, maybe later.

00:34:41.309 --> 00:34:43.978
It must be from yesterday's team dinner.

00:34:44.061 --> 00:34:46.606
Looks like she overdid it even more
with the farewell.

00:34:46.689 --> 00:34:47.732
Farewell?

00:34:49.358 --> 00:34:50.818
Is someone getting demoted again?

00:34:50.902 --> 00:34:53.029
You didn't know?

00:34:53.112 --> 00:34:55.072
Ms. Song submitted
a one-year leave request.

00:34:55.156 --> 00:34:55.990
What?

00:34:58.451 --> 00:35:00.286
Wait, a leave of absence?

00:35:00.369 --> 00:35:02.872
For an entire year?

00:35:28.147 --> 00:35:29.148
Junior.

00:35:32.068 --> 00:35:34.362
This is your first meeting
with Director Baek?

00:35:34.445 --> 00:35:36.239
-Yes.
-Brace yourself.

00:35:36.322 --> 00:35:40.576
He's so thorough,
he makes plans from A to Z.

00:35:43.579 --> 00:35:46.415
With designs like this,
there won't be any work-life balance.

00:35:48.334 --> 00:35:50.169
-Do you have a girlfriend?
-Yes.

00:35:51.712 --> 00:35:52.797
Ask for her forgiveness.

00:35:54.173 --> 00:35:57.969
Right, and a sleeping bag for all-nighters
is a must when coming to work.

00:35:58.761 --> 00:36:00.179
A sleeping bag.

00:36:00.263 --> 00:36:01.806
Okay, a sleeping bag.

00:36:15.236 --> 00:36:16.070
Director Baek.

00:36:16.696 --> 00:36:17.863
-Yes?
-Here.

00:36:26.372 --> 00:36:27.498
This looks good.

00:36:29.417 --> 00:36:30.626
The line's now moved and…

00:36:30.710 --> 00:36:33.212
Hyun, you're using curves now.
You've grown.

00:36:33.296 --> 00:36:34.213
Good.

00:36:36.424 --> 00:36:38.551
-Is the next one done by the newbie?
-Yes.

00:36:38.634 --> 00:36:41.387
For a first-timer, it's classic and nice.

00:36:41.470 --> 00:36:44.473
-Yes, looks good. I see the potential.
-It looks good?

00:36:46.183 --> 00:36:48.769
Everything looks good.
Let's head out on time today.

00:36:50.479 --> 00:36:51.439
Time to go home!

00:36:55.109 --> 00:36:57.528
Take a day off tomorrow.
Just get some rest.

00:36:59.488 --> 00:37:00.614
Go home now!

00:37:10.374 --> 00:37:11.751
I'll do it.

00:37:11.834 --> 00:37:14.920
Stay inside. It feels chilly.

00:37:15.004 --> 00:37:17.131
It's over 34°C today.

00:37:17.715 --> 00:37:20.176
No, not really. It's still winter.

00:37:21.927 --> 00:37:22.845
Head inside.

00:37:23.512 --> 00:37:24.722
-You're acting weird.
-No.

00:37:24.805 --> 00:37:25.806
What's gotten into you?

00:37:25.890 --> 00:37:27.641
I'll take care of it.

00:37:27.725 --> 00:37:29.060
Be careful.

00:37:29.143 --> 00:37:30.061
Hold on.

00:37:34.732 --> 00:37:35.858
What's all this?

00:37:36.525 --> 00:37:37.485
Is it some party?

00:37:40.780 --> 00:37:41.697
Eat up.

00:37:46.577 --> 00:37:48.496
And no more work dinners from now on.

00:37:48.579 --> 00:37:50.998
You're so responsible,
but it's too much for your body.

00:37:51.999 --> 00:37:53.000
What do you mean?

00:37:55.586 --> 00:37:57.713
It's all good. The best.

00:37:59.298 --> 00:38:00.466
Now eat up.

00:38:05.679 --> 00:38:06.514
So…

00:38:07.848 --> 00:38:09.809
when are you going to tell me?

00:38:13.104 --> 00:38:15.815
Nothing. Whenever you're ready.

00:38:15.898 --> 00:38:17.191
Take your time.

00:38:21.404 --> 00:38:22.530
Aren't you going to bed?

00:38:26.617 --> 00:38:27.701
Aren't you going to bed?

00:38:35.126 --> 00:38:36.710
MUSIC FOR EXPECTING MOMS AND BABIES

00:38:38.212 --> 00:38:39.213
What is it?

00:38:42.383 --> 00:38:43.217
Hey.

00:38:45.594 --> 00:38:46.595
What are you doing?

00:38:51.684 --> 00:38:52.560
You two sleep first.

00:38:54.562 --> 00:38:55.771
Sleep first.

00:39:04.155 --> 00:39:05.114
So adorable.

00:39:08.075 --> 00:39:08.909
So cute, right?

00:39:09.827 --> 00:39:10.953
That's cute.

00:39:11.036 --> 00:39:12.621
You got a new boyfriend?

00:39:12.705 --> 00:39:15.458
Your jewelry changes
with the guy you're seeing.

00:39:16.292 --> 00:39:18.919
By the way, why are we here?
Is Director Jeon having a baby?

00:39:21.213 --> 00:39:22.465
-Seul.
-Yes?

00:39:22.548 --> 00:39:25.551
What would you do if your friend
kept a huge secret from you?

00:39:29.096 --> 00:39:29.972
I don't know.

00:39:30.848 --> 00:39:34.018
Maybe they're hiding it for a reason.

00:39:34.518 --> 00:39:36.395
What if that secret is life-changing?

00:39:37.730 --> 00:39:40.107
What if you can't just stand by,
as a friend?

00:39:42.443 --> 00:39:43.611
This one?

00:39:44.612 --> 00:39:48.073
Is there one with a more subtle stone?

00:39:48.157 --> 00:39:50.951
Without the knuckle effect,
something that hurts less.

00:39:51.035 --> 00:39:54.872
Is there a ring
that isn't too heavy or too light,

00:39:54.955 --> 00:39:58.125
one that feels barely there
and blends into daily life?

00:39:58.209 --> 00:39:59.376
But with a large diamond.

00:39:59.460 --> 00:40:01.462
Certainly, I'll check that for you.

00:40:01.545 --> 00:40:02.505
Thanks.

00:40:02.588 --> 00:40:04.048
I asked the question first.

00:40:07.593 --> 00:40:08.677
Are you seeing someone?

00:40:09.887 --> 00:40:10.721
Oh, well…

00:40:11.305 --> 00:40:12.139
Just…

00:40:13.390 --> 00:40:15.309
Who's the guy you've been seeing?

00:40:15.392 --> 00:40:16.227
It's just some guy.

00:40:16.310 --> 00:40:17.478
Why do you keep asking?

00:40:17.978 --> 00:40:20.523
You're keeping that a secret?
Come on. Tell me.

00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:23.609
-Why do you keep asking?
-Come on. Who is it?

00:40:25.569 --> 00:40:26.403
Seung-taek.

00:40:27.363 --> 00:40:28.197
What?

00:40:29.198 --> 00:40:30.032
Hey.

00:40:47.091 --> 00:40:48.384
Since when?

00:40:49.468 --> 00:40:52.221
Why did you keep it from me
that you two got back together?

00:40:52.304 --> 00:40:56.433
Just in case something goes wrong again…

00:40:57.893 --> 00:40:59.812
Why didn't you tell me?

00:40:59.895 --> 00:41:01.647
Well, I tried.

00:41:01.730 --> 00:41:05.776
But every time I did,
you say you're out for a walk with Song,

00:41:05.859 --> 00:41:08.362
or traveling with her,
or shopping with her.

00:41:11.365 --> 00:41:12.199
Wait, then…

00:41:13.284 --> 00:41:14.326
Oh Seung-taek.

00:41:16.495 --> 00:41:18.205
Was it really yours?

00:41:18.289 --> 00:41:19.665
What now?

00:41:21.083 --> 00:41:22.793
-"What now?"
-I mean this.

00:41:23.627 --> 00:41:24.628
Why is it here?

00:41:30.259 --> 00:41:31.427
Wasn't it ours?

00:41:32.469 --> 00:41:33.762
Was it theirs?

00:41:35.014 --> 00:41:36.390
What are you talking about?

00:41:38.892 --> 00:41:42.104
By the way, since when?

00:41:50.613 --> 00:41:52.072
On our first Christmas,

00:41:53.324 --> 00:41:55.117
I made you wait two hours

00:41:56.118 --> 00:41:58.537
because I went overboard
trying to choose the best gift.

00:42:00.748 --> 00:42:02.666
I didn't drink wine and chose soju

00:42:04.168 --> 00:42:07.546
because I wanted to stay sober
a little longer with you.

00:42:09.214 --> 00:42:10.924
I can't handle wine well.

00:42:15.304 --> 00:42:16.889
You were my lucky charm.

00:42:19.558 --> 00:42:23.562
Even with the 17-hour time difference,
you managed to stay awake

00:42:23.646 --> 00:42:27.066
to call me whenever I had a match.

00:42:30.069 --> 00:42:31.820
Was it Christmas seven years ago?

00:42:33.113 --> 00:42:36.075
You came to see me
even though you had a match

00:42:37.076 --> 00:42:38.243
the next day.

00:42:38.327 --> 00:42:41.789
I did. For just three hours.

00:42:43.165 --> 00:42:46.293
I just saw you at the airport
and flew back.

00:42:48.087 --> 00:42:50.255
I just missed you so much.

00:42:58.138 --> 00:42:59.723
I actually went there

00:43:01.183 --> 00:43:02.726
because I wanted to see you.

00:43:03.936 --> 00:43:05.896
I was hoping to run into you again,

00:43:06.980 --> 00:43:09.817
because we went there every Christmas.

00:43:13.237 --> 00:43:15.864
Hoping for a Christmas miracle.

00:43:19.868 --> 00:43:20.744
Seung-taek, let's--

00:43:20.828 --> 00:43:22.246
I can't be your friend.

00:43:23.747 --> 00:43:24.581
I still…

00:43:28.627 --> 00:43:30.129
like you so much.

00:43:32.297 --> 00:43:33.549
How can we be friends?

00:44:05.622 --> 00:44:07.249
What have I done all along?

00:44:07.332 --> 00:44:08.625
What have you done?

00:44:09.877 --> 00:44:11.211
Did you think I was pregnant?

00:44:14.047 --> 00:44:17.342
Da-ye told me you took a leave
for an entire year.

00:44:19.428 --> 00:44:20.471
I did that…

00:44:22.473 --> 00:44:24.183
to try med school again.

00:44:26.518 --> 00:44:28.562
I decided to start studying again.

00:44:29.772 --> 00:44:33.025
But you've been gagging a lot
and rubbing your stomach lately.

00:44:33.108 --> 00:44:34.318
That's because of that day.

00:44:34.401 --> 00:44:36.737
The team dinner and farewell party
lasted till dawn.

00:44:36.820 --> 00:44:39.198
-I didn't feel fine.
-You've been putting on weight.

00:44:42.242 --> 00:44:43.076
Is this funny?

00:44:44.328 --> 00:44:47.706
It's because of you.
You cook three times a day for me.

00:44:56.298 --> 00:44:57.508
Then we should do this.

00:44:58.592 --> 00:44:59.843
Let's have a joint wedding.

00:45:01.178 --> 00:45:02.012
What?

00:45:02.888 --> 00:45:03.847
A home wedding.

00:45:05.432 --> 00:45:08.310
In fact,
I've prepared something for you.

00:45:09.853 --> 00:45:10.687
Prepare what?

00:45:15.359 --> 00:45:16.568
VIRGIN ROAD
AISLE - ALTAR

00:45:16.652 --> 00:45:17.569
Here.

00:45:17.653 --> 00:45:19.571
This is the aisle.

00:45:19.655 --> 00:45:22.115
There will likely be
many older guests from Patan.

00:45:22.199 --> 00:45:24.201
So space out the seats in units.

00:45:24.910 --> 00:45:27.079
In front of the gate,
we can set up a floral arch

00:45:27.162 --> 00:45:29.623
that connects with the flowers
along the aisle.

00:45:32.251 --> 00:45:34.920
And we'll turn this common area
into a photo zone.

00:45:35.003 --> 00:45:38.382
We can decorate it nicely,
so people can take pictures.

00:45:38.465 --> 00:45:40.133
Upstairs, the bride's room.

00:45:40.217 --> 00:45:41.843
The first floor is barrier-free.

00:45:41.927 --> 00:45:44.596
Seul's grandpa and Seung-taek
will be comfortable.

00:45:45.806 --> 00:45:47.975
The outdoor tables
will be laid out in a zigzag

00:45:48.058 --> 00:45:49.851
for the traffic flow and spaciousness.

00:45:51.812 --> 00:45:52.646
That's it.

00:46:02.990 --> 00:46:03.824
What's wrong?

00:46:04.741 --> 00:46:05.617
It's just…

00:46:08.412 --> 00:46:10.163
I'm not into having a joint one.

00:46:15.043 --> 00:46:16.253
Does this make sense?

00:46:16.336 --> 00:46:19.006
I wanted to be the groom,
but I'm the planner.

00:46:19.965 --> 00:46:21.091
Tell me about it.

00:46:21.174 --> 00:46:23.552
I thought you were from a wedding company.

00:46:25.846 --> 00:46:27.639
Don't tell me you've been married before.

00:46:30.517 --> 00:46:31.351
So many times.

00:46:32.436 --> 00:46:33.312
What?

00:46:33.395 --> 00:46:37.024
To marry you,
I did all the sketches and research.

00:46:37.983 --> 00:46:39.151
Everything was prepared.

00:46:40.068 --> 00:46:41.028
Like what?

00:46:41.987 --> 00:46:45.949
Like remodeling the house into a nursery,
researching a first birthday ring,

00:46:46.033 --> 00:46:48.160
and checking out
hospitals and postpartum care…

00:46:49.870 --> 00:46:52.956
We can't lose to them.
You can't even sleep if you lose, right?

00:46:54.207 --> 00:46:55.208
But you know what?

00:46:56.001 --> 00:46:56.960
Today is that day.

00:46:58.462 --> 00:46:59.379
Let's just sleep.

00:47:08.805 --> 00:47:10.891
-So cute.
-Yes, I like it.

00:47:11.725 --> 00:47:12.559
Stand there.

00:47:20.609 --> 00:47:23.195
-What is this?
-So cute, isn't it?

00:47:24.613 --> 00:47:26.615
Yes, the roses and pansies.

00:47:26.698 --> 00:47:28.825
Will hydrangeas be available that day?

00:47:31.411 --> 00:47:32.245
Yes.

00:47:33.497 --> 00:47:35.791
You think this photo is better
than this one?

00:47:35.874 --> 00:47:37.042
This is way better.

00:47:37.125 --> 00:47:40.087
-Both of them look better in this one.
-Okay.

00:47:42.381 --> 00:47:45.008
The two of them
are really getting married

00:47:45.092 --> 00:47:46.510
at our house tomorrow?

00:47:46.593 --> 00:47:50.472
Right, it's their last night.
I wonder what they're up to today.

00:47:56.770 --> 00:47:57.729
I've been your senior,

00:47:58.689 --> 00:47:59.523
a boyfriend,

00:48:00.273 --> 00:48:02.109
and a friend,

00:48:03.527 --> 00:48:05.320
but I didn't think I could be family.

00:48:06.613 --> 00:48:07.698
Because I thought

00:48:08.990 --> 00:48:11.159
that was something
that could never happen.

00:48:13.787 --> 00:48:16.206
The road ahead with me will be icy,

00:48:17.332 --> 00:48:18.625
but I'll become braver.

00:48:20.168 --> 00:48:21.795
I'll drop my pride.

00:48:22.504 --> 00:48:23.922
I'll let you win more.

00:48:24.798 --> 00:48:25.799
I'll smile more.

00:48:31.304 --> 00:48:33.098
I was actually scared

00:48:34.641 --> 00:48:36.393
that bringing up marriage again

00:48:38.061 --> 00:48:40.897
might make us break up.

00:49:21.021 --> 00:49:23.523
It feels like the dream
I've had all my life…

00:49:26.401 --> 00:49:27.736
has finally come true.

00:49:56.973 --> 00:49:58.183
SEUNG-TAEK AND SEUL

00:50:19.371 --> 00:50:20.205
Thank you.

00:50:24.793 --> 00:50:26.127
Oh, my.

00:50:26.211 --> 00:50:27.754
Oh, my goodness.

00:50:30.549 --> 00:50:32.133
Oh, hello.

00:50:32.217 --> 00:50:33.718
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

00:50:35.220 --> 00:50:36.972
-It's been so long.
-It's been a while.

00:50:37.055 --> 00:50:40.016
-Look at you! You've grown so much.
-You've really grown.

00:50:40.600 --> 00:50:42.060
-Congratulations.
-See you inside.

00:50:50.735 --> 00:50:54.030
The purpose of this wedding is
to announce the union of both parties

00:50:54.114 --> 00:50:57.576
and to establish their relationship
as life partners.

00:50:58.535 --> 00:51:00.495
Hi. Let me see.

00:51:00.579 --> 00:51:01.913
You've really dressed up.

00:51:01.997 --> 00:51:02.914
WEDDING PROGRAM

00:51:02.998 --> 00:51:04.499
1. INTRODUCTION
2. PREPARATION

00:51:04.583 --> 00:51:07.669
How come it's so stiff?
This isn't a courtroom.

00:51:07.752 --> 00:51:09.337
This is my style. Move over.

00:51:09.421 --> 00:51:11.006
-Seriously.
-Move out of the way.

00:51:11.089 --> 00:51:14.467
Hello. Go straight inside.

00:51:14.551 --> 00:51:15.427
Hello.

00:51:15.510 --> 00:51:16.344
I got it.

00:51:18.889 --> 00:51:20.765
-Congratulations, Seul.
-Thanks.

00:51:20.849 --> 00:51:22.183
-See you out there.
-Good luck.

00:51:22.267 --> 00:51:23.101
Congratulations.

00:51:31.318 --> 00:51:32.193
Perfect.

00:51:36.615 --> 00:51:37.449
Let's go.

00:51:48.376 --> 00:51:49.794
Here comes the groom.

00:51:52.047 --> 00:51:53.340
Here I come!

00:51:55.675 --> 00:51:56.593
Thank you.

00:52:10.023 --> 00:52:10.857
Congratulations.

00:52:11.858 --> 00:52:14.694
Now the bride, the star of today,
will make her entrance.

00:52:15.487 --> 00:52:20.408
I hope all the guests will welcome her
with a round of enthusiastic cheers.

00:52:31.044 --> 00:52:33.046
Please welcome the bride.

00:53:16.256 --> 00:53:17.090
Don't cry.

00:53:19.884 --> 00:53:23.263
They look amazing. Whose friends are they?

00:53:23.346 --> 00:53:26.224
Pretty amazing, right? They're my friends.

00:53:30.061 --> 00:53:33.148
Next, Village Head Go
will give the officiant's speech.

00:53:34.024 --> 00:53:35.316
Give him a round of applause.

00:53:46.953 --> 00:53:51.499
Marriage is more than a promise
between two people.

00:53:51.583 --> 00:53:53.251
It's the beginning

00:53:53.334 --> 00:53:56.838
of an everlasting bond shared with family.

00:53:59.049 --> 00:54:03.511
Just as today begins
under this clear, blue sky,

00:54:03.595 --> 00:54:06.806
there will be moments of

00:54:07.515 --> 00:54:10.351
stormy winds…

00:54:18.735 --> 00:54:19.736
I mean,

00:54:20.737 --> 00:54:22.739
those winds will only make you…

00:54:23.656 --> 00:54:25.533
They will only make you stronger.

00:54:26.534 --> 00:54:27.577
Are you okay?

00:54:27.660 --> 00:54:29.329
-What do we do?
-It's too windy.

00:54:34.751 --> 00:54:37.837
So, just live well, be happy.

00:54:38.546 --> 00:54:42.133
-Thank you so much for the warm words.
-Oh, no.

00:54:43.009 --> 00:54:45.929
Considering the weather,
we'll keep the ceremony brief.

00:54:46.012 --> 00:54:48.807
There's only one thing
that really matters at a wedding.

00:54:48.890 --> 00:54:52.393
Next, we'll have the marriage vows
and notarization.

00:54:52.477 --> 00:54:55.480
Bride and groom,
please look at each other.

00:54:59.400 --> 00:55:02.362
Groom, will you love the bride
for all eternity?

00:55:04.364 --> 00:55:05.198
Yes.

00:55:06.658 --> 00:55:10.245
Bride, will you love the groom
for all eternity?

00:55:11.871 --> 00:55:12.705
Yes!

00:55:13.373 --> 00:55:17.252
Very well, then. I now pronounce you

00:55:17.335 --> 00:55:19.587
husband and wife.

00:56:01.212 --> 00:56:02.255
I'm throwing it.

00:56:10.013 --> 00:56:11.723
-Su-bak!
-Hey, Song Su-bak.

00:56:16.519 --> 00:56:17.604
Su-bak.

00:56:18.980 --> 00:56:21.107
Why are you bringing this to me?

00:56:21.191 --> 00:56:22.692
He's the flower boy.

00:56:23.985 --> 00:56:26.029
Next up is Dr. Song.

00:56:26.112 --> 00:56:26.946
Hey.

00:56:38.625 --> 00:56:39.876
Everyone!

00:56:39.959 --> 00:56:41.211
-Enjoy the food.
-Thanks.

00:56:41.294 --> 00:56:42.170
A little more.

00:56:42.253 --> 00:56:44.672
To be honest,
you were a disaster as the MC.

00:56:44.756 --> 00:56:46.466
Then why didn't you do it yourself?

00:56:46.549 --> 00:56:47.842
You said you'd do it.

00:56:51.721 --> 00:56:54.224
Are you guys having a drink already?

00:56:55.642 --> 00:56:56.768
Thank you.

00:56:59.395 --> 00:57:00.438
Cheers.

00:57:01.314 --> 00:57:02.982
-Hurry up.
-I'm coming with you.

00:57:03.066 --> 00:57:04.484
Be careful, kiddos!

00:57:05.777 --> 00:57:08.446
Seeing the kids,
I can tell this house hasn't changed.

00:57:12.325 --> 00:57:14.327
Let's take a group photo outside.

00:57:14.410 --> 00:57:15.370
Everyone, come on out!

00:57:15.453 --> 00:57:17.372
-Okay.
-Let's go.

00:57:17.455 --> 00:57:19.415
All right, one, two, three, smile!

00:57:29.217 --> 00:57:30.051
Let's stick it on.

00:57:30.134 --> 00:57:31.469
What a great picture.

00:57:31.553 --> 00:57:32.595
So cute, right?

00:57:32.679 --> 00:57:34.764
Yes. I wonder who took them.

00:57:38.393 --> 00:57:39.227
All done?

00:57:47.986 --> 00:57:49.696
When are we going to clean all this up?

00:57:51.739 --> 00:57:52.699
I know.

00:57:53.199 --> 00:57:54.325
What do you think of us?

00:57:57.912 --> 00:58:01.416
You told me
a house tells you about its owner.

00:58:03.209 --> 00:58:04.085
You and me.

00:58:04.752 --> 00:58:05.837
What do you think of us?

00:58:14.304 --> 00:58:15.722
We're doing great

00:58:16.764 --> 00:58:18.683
and will surely keep doing well.

00:58:19.767 --> 00:58:21.060
That's what it's telling me.

00:58:25.398 --> 00:58:27.108
Not sure if the house changed us…

00:58:27.191 --> 00:58:29.110
Or if we changed the house.

00:58:33.740 --> 00:58:34.699
Let's begin.

00:58:52.925 --> 00:58:53.801
Do-ha.

00:58:54.761 --> 00:58:55.595
Come here.

00:58:58.723 --> 00:58:59.891
Remember this?

00:58:59.974 --> 00:59:00.808
Of course.

00:59:00.892 --> 00:59:02.769
This is where my first love began.

00:59:04.604 --> 00:59:05.813
Did you like me back then?

00:59:07.357 --> 00:59:08.441
Of course.

00:59:09.984 --> 00:59:10.818
Me too.

00:59:13.821 --> 00:59:14.656
Put it up.

00:59:14.739 --> 00:59:15.907
There's a lot to clean up.

00:59:26.542 --> 00:59:29.671
We met one summer when we were 12,
and now we're 30.

00:59:30.505 --> 00:59:32.548
It's already our 19th summer.

00:59:37.804 --> 00:59:39.013
Wow! I won!

00:59:40.139 --> 00:59:42.517
From the first summer we spent together…

00:59:43.309 --> 00:59:44.143
Oh, no.

00:59:45.186 --> 00:59:47.271
One, two, three.

00:59:51.984 --> 00:59:54.445
I'm going to like you all summer long.

00:59:56.197 --> 00:59:57.865
If you don't join me this summer,

00:59:58.825 --> 00:59:59.992
it means nothing to me.

01:00:00.743 --> 01:00:01.577
-Hey!
-Hey!

01:00:06.791 --> 01:00:08.459
Ha-gyeong. I'm not leaving.

01:00:15.299 --> 01:00:16.384
I like you.

01:00:17.593 --> 01:00:20.138
Are you really leaving? Don't go.

01:00:23.182 --> 01:00:24.016
I like you.

01:00:30.773 --> 01:00:31.607
So warm.

01:00:36.028 --> 01:00:37.947
JONG-MAN JR

01:00:45.747 --> 01:00:46.581
And now…

01:00:47.957 --> 01:00:50.001
Back to our 19th summer.

01:00:53.045 --> 01:00:54.297
How many summers…

01:00:55.882 --> 01:00:57.383
Do we still have ahead of us?

01:01:26.204 --> 01:01:28.706
Today might be our last summer.

01:01:30.041 --> 01:01:32.084
But we'll love each other
like it's our first.

01:01:32.794 --> 01:01:35.296
-And we'll love each other…
-We'll love each other…

01:01:35.379 --> 01:01:37.548
-like it's our last.
-like it's our last.

01:02:00.822 --> 01:02:03.783
-This summer is always…
-This summer is always…

01:02:05.993 --> 01:02:07.620
-our last summer.
-our last summer.

01:03:19.191 --> 01:03:20.526
THANKS FOR WATCHING LAST SUMMER
