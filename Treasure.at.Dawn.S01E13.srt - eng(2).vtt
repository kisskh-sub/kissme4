Let me ask you something.

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.640
Does the city lord have any old head or neck injuries?

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.920

The city lord was attacked many years ago.

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.520
The back of his neck was grazed by an arrow,

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:20.670
but not the vitals.

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:22.920
That's what I thought.

Really?

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.390
I think it's the result of pus and blood

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:29.110
that is from an old wound treated incompletely and put pressure on it.

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:30.640
Don't worry. I've got it.

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:31.110

The city lord's headache was indeed caused

by pus triggered by the pressure of residual iron slag

Then my father now...

This wound is too old,

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:52.270
so the iron slag adheres to

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:53.240
and fuses with the aorta.

If the iron slag is removed,

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:56.030
it may injure the main vein.

00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:37.880
just ask me.

00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:39.360
I will do my best.

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:42.790
Jiu, you don't have to do this.

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:44.760
This is my job.

Besides,

I'm just keeping my promise.

Please remember

that the city lord's affected area

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:52.550
may be in some pain later.

00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:54.160
I'll prescribe some painkillers,

00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:55.360
but remember,

You're welcome.

Go see him.

Right.

Anger is bad for your health.

You're the one I've promoted

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.830
and the only person I can rely on at the moment.

00:11:55.710 --> 00:11:57.640
I'll never forget

00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:00.480
your kindness to me.

00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:04.160
Go on.

How are you feeling?

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:01.360
Does it still hurt?

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:04.210
Yes?

00:13:04.670 --> 00:13:05.590
I'll ask Fu Sheng.

00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:09.360
Upper jaw.

00:13:09.710 --> 00:13:10.830
The upper jaw hurts.

00:13:12.830 --> 00:13:14.830
The incision was made at the back of the neck,

00:13:15.310 --> 00:13:16.880
so how come it hurts in your mouth?

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:19.550
Young Mistress.

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:22.000
That porridge just came out of the pot,

00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:23.550
but you didn't even blow on it.

00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:29.790
I'm sorry, father.

00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:31.190
Did it burn you?

00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:32.830
It's okay.

00:13:33.550 --> 00:13:35.790
I'm blessed to have

00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:36.950
such a caring daughter.

00:13:38.590 --> 00:13:39.520
I'll blow on it.

Rest well tonight.

00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:54.480
I'll be back in the morning.

Young Mistress rarely feeds you porridge,

so why are you, a man,

00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:48.360
afraid of scalding?

00:14:52.950 --> 00:14:53.760
Let me ask you.

00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:56.120
After the Golden Bloom Banquet,

00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:57.590
what about Ma Gang

00:14:58.070 --> 00:14:58.880
and the Chamber of Commerce?

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:00.280
Still under control for the time being.

Please do not worry too much.

00:15:02.830 --> 00:15:04.360
Getting well is the most important thing.

00:15:04.830 --> 00:15:06.590
You two always anger me,

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:08.710

You know me?

00:15:46.910 --> 00:15:48.590
I'm a waiter from Chunyun House.

00:15:48.590 --> 00:15:50.240
Yingying asked me

00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:51.520
to come

00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:53.040
and tell you.

Tell me about what?

00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:56.280
Yingying said

00:15:56.430 --> 00:15:58.520
she'd have a banquet at Chunyun House at noon tomorrow

00:15:58.520 --> 00:15:59.280
and would like you to attend.

00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:00.310
Is that all?

Yes.

Since Mr. Gu has been informed,

00:16:03.430 --> 00:16:04.830
I'll take my leave.

00:16:09.950 --> 00:16:11.790
It's not a festival,

00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:13.550
but she invited me to dinner suddenly,

00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:17.280
so is it a trap?

00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:20.590
But the trap is set by Yingying,

00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:23.830
so I don't mind

00:16:24.550 --> 00:16:26.310
risking my life to please a beauty.

00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:32.310

Who said it was to wake you up?

00:16:41.710 --> 00:16:42.590
Then what are you doing?

00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:45.710
When I came in just now,

00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:47.040
I found you snoring extremely heavily.

00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:49.000
It's because your spleen and lungs are weak

00:16:49.070 --> 00:16:50.360
and your phlegm and stasis are blocking each other.

00:16:51.430 --> 00:16:52.430
I'll give you acupuncture

00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:53.880
and then prescribe you some medicines.

00:16:54.190 --> 00:16:55.040
Take them when you get back.

00:16:55.550 --> 00:16:56.670

It's embarrassing.

00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:03.790
I'm too popular, so I can't help it.

00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:04.720
One last needle.

00:17:05.390 --> 00:17:06.050
Don't.

to open a clinic for you

00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:28.550

Yes, I do.

I'm here today to honor that promise

00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:34.680
and open a clinic for you.

00:17:36.390 --> 00:17:36.960
I don't want it.

00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:38.550
Why not?

Let me ask you again.

Before, Chairman Song made things difficult for me,

00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:18.240
but you helped me out.

00:19:19.150 --> 00:19:21.200
I hurt you by mistake because I was under an illusion,

00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:22.790
but instead of blaming me,

00:19:22.790 --> 00:19:24.150
you took care of me.

so I can only treat you to dinner as a token of my appreciation.

If you hadn't recalled,

the consequences

would range

00:32:42.870 --> 00:32:43.790
I know

00:32:44.790 --> 00:32:47.390
you'll despise me when you

00:32:49.110 --> 00:32:50.390
find out who I really am.

00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:20.070
You have suffered too much.

00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:31.830
I was bought as a child by Zhang Hu and his wife.

00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:34.480
After that, I was branded with this mark.

00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:40.480
Abducted children

00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:42.040
often don't have enough to eat.

00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:43.960
Wang Song

00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:46.480
was their hired cook.

00:33:47.150 --> 00:33:49.060
He had some food,

00:33:49.650 --> 00:33:51.200
so the girls...

00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:00.310
Yingying.

00:34:01.150 --> 00:34:02.390
Yingying.

00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:04.760
I brought you something.

00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:05.830
You're starving, aren't you?

00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:07.440
What?

00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:08.400
You don't want to eat?

00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:10.480
You haven't had enough of starving, have you?

00:34:15.750 --> 00:34:17.630
Yingying, you know I love you the most.

00:34:17.630 --> 00:34:18.630
I'll leave you anything

00:34:18.630 --> 00:34:19.670
that tastes good.

00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:22.670
If you obey me,

00:34:23.110 --> 00:34:23.670
this chicken leg

00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:24.880
is yours.

00:34:25.110 --> 00:34:26.480
And there's more, okay?

00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:41.880
Let bygones be bygones.

00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:43.150
Don't mention it.

00:34:50.110 --> 00:34:50.920
I'll stay with you

00:34:52.190 --> 00:34:53.230
and protect you

00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:54.480
from now on.

00:35:06.550 --> 00:35:07.880
There's something else

00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:08.880
I'm not telling you.

00:35:10.630 --> 00:35:11.680
Actually,

00:35:14.230 --> 00:35:16.040
the Hearsay-capturing Pavilion is mine.

00:35:19.150 --> 00:35:21.320
I grew up in the slums.

00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:23.850
In order to survive,

00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:26.880
I've been working as a detective in the outer city since I was ten.

00:35:28.150 --> 00:35:29.400
At twelve,

00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:31.230
I became the first detective in the outer city.

00:35:32.710 --> 00:35:33.800
At fourteen,

00:35:34.190 --> 00:35:35.840
I sold myself into the Chunyun House

00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:36.920
to be an entertainer.

00:35:37.910 --> 00:35:40.240
I became the top one just to get information.

00:35:42.070 --> 00:35:43.110
At sixteen,

00:35:43.270 --> 00:35:44.840
I founded the Hearsay-capturing Pavilion.

00:35:45.880 --> 00:35:46.920
At eighteen,

00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:48.670
I recruited Feng Qianli.

00:35:49.670 --> 00:35:50.880
Today,

00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:54.270
Hearsay-capturing Pavilion has three thousand detectives.

00:35:56.150 --> 00:35:57.400
Everyone

00:35:57.710 --> 00:35:58.880
in Xichuan

00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:00.840
knows about it.

00:36:09.070 --> 00:36:10.520
I did lie to you.

00:36:12.070 --> 00:36:13.590
If you can't accept...

00:36:13.590 --> 00:36:14.800
I can't imagine

00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:17.070
how much you suffered

00:36:17.230 --> 00:36:18.270
in the meantime.

00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:23.670
It's all in the past.

00:36:27.670 --> 00:36:28.440
By the way,

00:36:29.150 --> 00:36:31.000
what was that Breakwall you were talking about?

00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:34.070
It's a long story.

00:36:34.710 --> 00:36:35.670
Fu Sheng and I

00:36:36.020 --> 00:36:37.480
met a tough opponent.

00:36:50.270 --> 00:36:51.440
How can you do business

00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:52.980
with all the doors and windows closed

00:36:53.230 --> 00:36:54.150
in the daytime?

00:36:57.230 --> 00:36:57.840
Give me that.

00:37:00.040 --> 00:37:00.710
Look.

00:37:01.190 --> 00:37:02.110
Put it here.

00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:03.520
Then?

00:37:03.670 --> 00:37:04.750
That's as far as I've got.

00:37:04.920 --> 00:37:06.550
There may be two more things missing.

00:37:14.750 --> 00:37:16.110
Gu Tian, why didn't you knock?

00:37:17.110 --> 00:37:18.880
Young Mistress, you don't need to hide it.

00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:21.270
I know you have the Bird Jade Plate.

00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:23.190
Gu Tian, what do you mean?

00:37:26.110 --> 00:37:27.950
Yingying is actually the person

00:37:27.950 --> 00:37:28.910
behind the Hearsay-capturing Pavilion.

00:37:29.070 --> 00:37:30.150
We've all been fooled by her.

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:35.110
You're the leader of the Hearsay-capturing Pavilion?

00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:37.320
Gu Tian was right.

00:37:38.230 --> 00:37:39.760
I lied to you,

00:37:40.630 --> 00:37:43.110
but I bear you no ill will

00:37:43.960 --> 00:37:46.400
and even envy your friendship.

00:37:46.710 --> 00:37:48.520
It's a blessing

00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:50.040
that you're honest with each other.

00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:51.550
If you think I'm not worthy

00:37:51.550 --> 00:37:53.920
of your company,

00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:56.270
I won't mention

00:37:56.550 --> 00:37:58.000
what I saw here.

00:38:04.590 --> 00:38:05.670
That thing is Fu Sheng's.

00:38:05.670 --> 00:38:07.440
Ask him

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:08.750
if he accepts you.

00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:17.920
Yes or no?

00:38:19.070 --> 00:38:19.630
Yes.

00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:22.070
I think it's a good thing.

00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:23.150
Look.

00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:24.520
We've been trying to enlist the help

00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:25.920
of the Hearsay-capturing Pavilion,

00:38:26.110 --> 00:38:26.920
but afraid

00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:27.840
we'll get into trouble.

00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:28.800
Now,

00:38:28.920 --> 00:38:29.800
here comes someone reliable.

00:38:30.230 --> 00:38:31.150
I think it's good.

00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:31.960
Come on.

00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:35.840
Since Fu Sheng has taken a stand,

00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:37.360
I must have no problem with it.

00:38:37.670 --> 00:38:38.270
By the way,

00:38:38.270 --> 00:38:40.150
there's your brother Hulu.

00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:41.550
We all like him too.

00:38:42.070 --> 00:38:44.150
Now that you've been honest with us,

00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:46.150
so from now on in Xichuan,

00:38:46.630 --> 00:38:47.270
I'll protect you.

00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:48.800
Thank you, Young Mistress.

00:38:49.630 --> 00:38:50.710
I'm already protecting the two of them,

00:38:50.710 --> 00:38:51.800
so I don't mind protecting one more.

00:38:52.440 --> 00:38:53.150
So from now on,

00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:54.590
the four of us will be

00:38:54.590 --> 00:38:56.840
the treasure-hunting squad in Xichuan.

00:38:56.840 --> 00:38:58.070
I'm the squad captain.

00:38:58.400 --> 00:38:59.440
Then the squad

00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:01.270
will rely on the captain

00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:03.710
for food, shelter, and transport.

00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:05.630
No problem.

00:39:07.630 --> 00:39:08.110
By the way,

00:39:08.150 --> 00:39:09.480
I heard from Gu Tian

00:39:09.750 --> 00:39:11.480
that you only found one piece of jade.

00:39:11.960 --> 00:39:13.880
The other two are still clueless.

00:39:14.230 --> 00:39:15.110
Yes.

00:39:15.230 --> 00:39:17.150
These things are scattered.

00:39:17.150 --> 00:39:18.440
We have no idea where they are.

00:39:18.630 --> 00:39:19.440
Besides,

00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:21.230
Li Zhizhuo is also looking for those.

00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:23.840
We need to be one step ahead of him.

00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:26.320
Since I'm a member of the squad,

00:39:26.630 --> 00:39:28.670
I must make another contribution.

00:39:28.920 --> 00:39:29.800
I think Hearsay-capturing Pavilion's

00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:33.110
three thousand people is more than enough

00:39:33.320 --> 00:39:34.800
for two pieces of jade.

00:39:35.940 --> 00:39:37.940
♪Aspire to make♪

00:39:38.020 --> 00:39:40.780

♪A difference♪

00:39:40.780 --> 00:39:42.020
[Operation Room]

00:39:50.150 --> 00:39:52.230
Why don't you have any presents whenever you come back?

00:39:52.230 --> 00:39:53.800
Can't you bring something good to eat?

00:39:57.270 --> 00:39:59.000
What do you eat? Worms?

00:39:59.270 --> 00:40:00.670
You can eat that.

00:40:00.710 --> 00:40:02.070
If you keep being unreasonable,

00:40:03.230 --> 00:40:04.630
I'll eat you tonight.

00:40:05.190 --> 00:40:06.700
This man is horrible.

00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:07.550
He's going to eat himself.

00:40:07.550 --> 00:40:08.750
That would be nice.

00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:10.440
I'll have some peace.

00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:14.840
Now I'll finally have my own place.

00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:18.110
It's furnished just like this.

00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:21.630
And I have Wood and the duck with me.

00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:25.110
I can do real experiments in there.

00:40:26.070 --> 00:40:28.270
Can that Wood take out his heart, too?

00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:29.270
Yes.

00:40:29.590 --> 00:40:31.750
Can that Wood see the blood vein?

00:40:31.750 --> 00:40:32.550
Of course.

00:40:33.110 --> 00:40:35.040
Then why do you always stay here?

00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:36.040
What's so great about it?

00:40:40.630 --> 00:40:41.880
It's surely good

00:40:47.020 --> 00:40:48.310
because of you guys.

00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:51.230
You guys? Who else is here?

00:41:00.710 --> 00:41:01.710
Why are you...

00:41:01.710 --> 00:41:03.230
Who did you hide here?

00:41:09.880 --> 00:41:11.670
It's not a big house.

00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:15.000
I didn't find anyone else.

00:41:15.320 --> 00:41:16.840
I didn't hide anyone here.

00:41:17.710 --> 00:41:18.670
It doesn't matter if you don't tell me.

00:41:18.670 --> 00:41:19.400
See you.

00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:21.320
So are you coming back?

00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:24.840
I own this clinic,

00:41:24.840 --> 00:41:26.150
so I can come whenever I want.

00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:27.330
That's right.

00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:31.150
Do you think

00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:32.230
I'm a weirdo?

00:41:34.710 --> 00:41:36.720
Haven't you always been a weirdo?

00:41:37.150 --> 00:41:38.000
Besides,

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:39.550
who isn't a weirdo in this clinic?

00:41:40.440 --> 00:41:41.040
Look.

00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:43.520
Gu Tian, who only cares

00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:44.920
about money but hasn't spent

00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:46.190
a cent on himself.

00:41:46.550 --> 00:41:48.750
And me, the Young Mistress

00:41:48.750 --> 00:41:50.110
who doesn't do anything but play with you guys.

00:41:51.550 --> 00:41:53.320
We wouldn't get together if we weren't similar.

00:41:54.520 --> 00:41:56.360
But it seems like we're the ones playing with you.

00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:57.920
That's not important.

00:41:58.190 --> 00:41:59.150
What matters is

00:41:59.400 --> 00:42:00.750
that whether you're weird or not,

00:42:02.670 --> 00:42:03.800
you're my friend.

00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:07.000
Friend?

00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:09.190
Then my friend,

00:42:09.630 --> 00:42:10.750
can you do me a favor?

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:11.750
What favor?

00:42:14.480 --> 00:42:15.070
Look.

00:42:15.590 --> 00:42:17.270
You just said we're friends,

00:42:17.590 --> 00:42:20.080
so shouldn't my friend help me

00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:21.360
with what he can't do?

00:42:22.520 --> 00:42:24.070
What were you going to say?

00:42:26.630 --> 00:42:27.360
Wen Jue.

00:42:28.750 --> 00:42:29.710
Actually,

00:42:30.360 --> 00:42:31.520
I have a big wish

00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:33.480
in Shangyi, but I've never

00:42:34.110 --> 00:42:36.040
had the chance to fulfill it.

00:42:36.190 --> 00:42:37.000
I feel that if I

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:39.230
don't tell you in person today,

00:42:39.590 --> 00:42:40.710
it will be very hard for me.

00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:43.270
After all,

00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:44.590
you're the best,

00:42:45.230 --> 00:42:45.840
prettiest,

00:42:46.270 --> 00:42:46.960
and smartest girl

00:42:47.360 --> 00:42:48.550
in Xichuan.

00:42:49.480 --> 00:42:50.590
So you'll definitely help me,

00:42:50.590 --> 00:42:51.040
right?

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:54.040
It's not appropriate.

00:42:54.440 --> 00:42:55.440
It's a bit abrupt.

00:42:55.440 --> 00:42:57.710
I've always wanted a cadaver

00:42:58.960 --> 00:43:00.670
to study for a heart replacement.

00:43:01.090 --> 00:43:01.760
Is that okay?

00:43:07.110 --> 00:43:08.670
Why don't you replace your own heart?

00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:11.880
My friend.
