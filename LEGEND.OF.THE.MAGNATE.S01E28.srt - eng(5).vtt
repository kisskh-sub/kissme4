That's right.

You're calling him Mr. Gu again.

-He's your son-in-law now.
-Exactly.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:11.720
Son-in-law.

Whatever I call him,
the meaning is the same.

00:10:14.110 --> 00:10:15.910
People are all born
and raised the same way.

00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:17.710
No need for so many formalities.

00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:19.440
This Mr. Gu of mine

00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:21.200
has the spirit of a true hero.

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:22.360
Whether as my friend

00:10:22.390 --> 00:10:23.360
or as my son-in-law,

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:24.560
he's a blessing to me.

00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:25.790
That's right.

00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:28.760
The war is over,

00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:31.530
but look at the state of Nanjing city now.

00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:33.680
The Confucius Temple is overgrown
with vegetation.

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:36.120
The Qinhuai River
has turned into a stinking ditch.

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:37.630
The once bustling Confucian temple

00:10:37.630 --> 00:10:39.150
is now covered with thorns and vines.

00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:39.870
We'll let

00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:42.870
the future generation
judge this war for its rights and wrongs.

00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:44.440
The most urgent task now

00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:46.750
is to improve the situation in Nanjing.

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:49.790
So how exactly should we proceed?

00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:55.670
The Liangjiang government office

00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:57.120
needs someone with a clean background

00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:59.080
with no connections to any faction.

00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:01.790
He must also have official status
and understand business.

00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:03.200
He needs to properly manage

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:04.390
the Seven Provinces of Jiangnan.

00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:05.590
Especially Nanjing,

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:08.910
which has significant importance
both domestically and internationally.

00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:10.750
We must at least make people say that

00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:12.440
since the imperial court
has reclaimed Nanjing,

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:13.320
the lives of common people

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:14.630
have improved from before.

00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:15.750
We certainly can't have people saying

00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:17.750
that Nanjing, under
the imperial court's control,

00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:19.010
has become even worse.

00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:21.320
Yes.

00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:22.920
But does this person

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:24.390
have to be me?

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:28.240
Mr. Gu, you're being too modest.

00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:33.800
This is exactly what makes him clever.

00:11:34.030 --> 00:11:35.750
Always waiting
until others have praised him enough

00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:37.550
before he's willing to respond.

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:39.250
That's not the case.

00:11:39.390 --> 00:11:40.330
I just feel that

00:11:40.390 --> 00:11:41.450
I lack experience.

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:43.030
If I were to

00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:44.440
take charge of this situation,

00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:45.790
I'm afraid I wouldn't command respect

00:11:45.790 --> 00:11:47.720
and would become a laughingstock.

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:48.630
Then tell me,

00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:50.510
who else could win everyone's respect?

00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:52.320
For example, Li Wantang from the capital,

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:53.630
Wu Caishen from Zhejiang,

00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:54.960
Jin Wencai from Shanxi,

00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:57.000
and Li Zhongdeng, the famous tea merchant.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.730
Aren't they all better than me?

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:01.640
His words sound better than

00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:02.870
those sung on stage.

00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:06.120
Since you know them so well,

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:07.360
how much do you know about

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:09.220
the stories behind these people?

00:12:15.390 --> 00:12:17.120
I've lost my mood for drinking.

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:18.600
Have a good chat with him.

00:12:20.630 --> 00:12:21.390
Don't see me out.

00:12:21.390 --> 00:12:24.000
[Wedding]

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.240
When he says not to see him out,
then don't.

00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:26.370
Don't make trouble.

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:29.000
Look at his guards.

00:12:29.390 --> 00:12:30.510
Even the lowest-ranked one

00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:33.240
is a second-rank official
wearing an Imperial Yellow Jacket.

00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:34.510
Those people you just mentioned

00:12:34.510 --> 00:12:36.240
wouldn't even catch his attention.

00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:37.390
How laughable.

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:38.240
Then tell me,

00:12:38.270 --> 00:12:39.720
who else is more powerful?

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:40.320
Easy.

00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:41.960
Why didn't you mention the Emperor

00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:43.090
or Empress Dowager?

00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:44.650
It seems you still don't understand

00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:46.380
what business is really about.

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:48.800
Please enlighten me.

00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:51.360
Fine.

00:12:52.270 --> 00:12:54.070
Let me explain it to you clearly.

00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:57.750
Fill my cup.

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:06.440
Li Million

00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:09.330
has the Sixth Prince as his backer.

00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:12.750
Wu Caishen is backed by the Left Minister.

00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:15.320
As for Li Zhongdeng,
he only rules a single province

00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:16.720
and won't amount to much.

00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:18.350
Jin Wencai is decent,

00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:20.290
but they say he's sickly.

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:22.440
What a sharp tongue you have,

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:24.500
insulting all the heroes of the land.

00:13:24.930 --> 00:13:26.200
Marshal Jiu simply doesn't want

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:27.720
the varying forces and the imperial court

00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:29.630
to interfere in Nanjing's matters.

00:13:29.630 --> 00:13:31.440
But he doesn't have business skills,

00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:32.970
so he has to seek out talented people.

00:13:32.970 --> 00:13:35.030
The current Viceroy of Liangjiang,
Rui Lin,

00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:36.150
has just been transferred here

00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:37.120
and has no money.

00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:39.070
Jiu is pressuring him

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:40.910
to release the funds
for demobilizing the troops.

00:13:40.910 --> 00:13:43.100
Having hundreds of thousands of soldiers
stationed outside the city

00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:44.600
is like waiting
for a powder keg to blow up.

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:46.120
You need to help him

00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:48.200
solve this problem as a merchant.

00:13:50.270 --> 00:13:51.240
I'm afraid that even if I

00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:52.570
sacrifice everything,

00:13:53.390 --> 00:13:55.520
I still can't contain this powder keg.

00:13:55.670 --> 00:13:56.530
You're scared?

00:14:00.790 --> 00:14:01.590
Of course I am.

00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:04.000
I have my mother and wife.

00:14:04.390 --> 00:14:05.590
Of course I'm scared.

00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:09.790
Just give us a date

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:10.790
and someone will

00:14:10.790 --> 00:14:12.480
escort you to Nanjing.

00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:14.630
Whether you can do it or not,

00:14:14.630 --> 00:14:17.030
you can decide
after you see the situation.

00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:18.550
Aren't you

00:14:19.270 --> 00:14:20.440
from the other side?

00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:21.750
When did you

00:14:22.030 --> 00:14:23.560
join Marshal Jiu's forces?

00:14:25.390 --> 00:14:27.120
You've been quite bold lately.

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:28.390
Taking advantage of being a newlywed

00:14:28.390 --> 00:14:29.990
and showing no respect to me.

00:14:30.390 --> 00:14:31.700
Join Jiu's forces?

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:32.870
Dream on.

00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:34.790
I was only 12 when I entered the palace.

00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:36.200
But I wouldn't serve the Emperor

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:37.550
and ran away when I had to.

00:14:37.550 --> 00:14:38.450
As for Jiu,

00:14:38.630 --> 00:14:40.830
he's not even qualified to wash my feet.

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:43.570
Stop asking about my business.

00:14:43.870 --> 00:14:44.930
See you in Nanjing.

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:46.200
Congrats.

00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:00.080
Brother.

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:02.180
You're really something.

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:04.630
This is the first time
I've seen Marshal Jiu

00:15:04.630 --> 00:15:05.790
being so polite to someone.

00:15:05.790 --> 00:15:07.120
You're something else.

00:15:08.630 --> 00:15:09.960
After this,

00:15:10.030 --> 00:15:11.630
all officials in the country

00:15:11.670 --> 00:15:13.000
will bow down to you

00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:14.760
and be scared out of their wits.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:15.630
I don't look for trouble;

00:15:15.630 --> 00:15:16.790
trouble finds me.

00:15:17.390 --> 00:15:18.990
They want me to be the advisor

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.130
to Rui Lin, the Viceroy of Liangjiang.

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:26.120
That's like grabbing food
from a hot oil pot.

00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:27.960
It's putting you on the hot seat.

00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:29.020
This job is no good.

00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:29.790
Exactly.

00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:30.790
Report!

00:15:31.270 --> 00:15:33.110
Master Li Wantang from Beijing

00:15:33.270 --> 00:15:35.870
has sent Mr. Li Qin
to offer congratulations

00:15:36.030 --> 00:15:38.000
and present a complete set of gifts.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.140
Pingyuan, I wish you good fortune.

00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:40.480
Mr. Li, good fortune to you.

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:41.340
Please come in.

00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:44.510
I've come to demand an explanation.

00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:46.150
Why didn't you tell me about your wedding?

00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:47.240
Couldn't spare a wedding drink for me?

00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:48.240
How stingy of you.

00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:49.290
I thought

00:15:49.290 --> 00:15:49.630
[Blessings and Auspiciousness]

00:15:49.630 --> 00:15:51.230
it was just a modest wedding.

00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:52.450
Why trouble you to come

00:15:52.450 --> 00:15:53.870
all the way from the capital for this?

00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:54.870
I planned to treat you to a drink

00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:56.670
when we meet again in the future.

00:15:56.910 --> 00:15:58.370
I came in a hurry this time.

00:15:58.480 --> 00:15:59.750
If my gifts aren't adequate,

00:15:59.750 --> 00:16:01.360
I'll make it up to you next time.

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:01.960
That's all trivial.

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:03.690
-Hello, Mr. Li.
-Hello, Mr. Li.

00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:05.810
Last time in Shanghai,

00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:07.000
you did me such a huge favor.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:08.930
I hope it didn't cause you trouble.

00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:10.440
What are you saying?

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:12.170
Of course it caused me trouble.

00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:14.030
That's why I've been

00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:15.690
feeling guilty all this time.

00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:18.270
In this world, there aren't many things

00:16:18.270 --> 00:16:19.800
that can satisfy everyone.

00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:20.960
We can't just do anything

00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:22.560
for the sake of making money.

00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:24.500
Helping you made me happy.

00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:25.600
If my father had won,

00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:27.460
I would have felt uncomfortable.

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:28.480
Why so?

00:16:29.790 --> 00:16:31.200
If all businesses

00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:33.270
depended on currying favor
with the powerful,

00:16:33.270 --> 00:16:33.910
wouldn't that discourage

00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:35.570
businesspeople everywhere?

00:16:36.910 --> 00:16:38.030
For those words alone,

00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:39.690
we should have a proper drink.

00:16:53.770 --> 00:16:54.370
By the way,

00:16:54.750 --> 00:16:55.720
your father doesn't know

00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:57.120
you're here with gifts, does he?

00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:57.870
He knows.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:00.550
Father.

00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:02.790
Where are you sending me this time?

00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:04.790
If it's not urgent, don't bother me.

00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:07.180
Busy or not, you have to go.

00:17:08.190 --> 00:17:09.260
Give this to him

00:17:09.550 --> 00:17:11.270
and pass along a few words.

00:17:12.109 --> 00:17:13.109
Who's getting married?

00:17:13.109 --> 00:17:13.839
Gu Pingyuan.

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:17.400
Gu... Gu Pingyuan?

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:19.569
Is that strange?

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:21.579
Remember this.

00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:23.380
If you can't beat this man,

00:17:23.589 --> 00:17:25.849
find a way to become his friend.

00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:32.270
And you,

00:17:32.490 --> 00:17:33.250
tell him.

00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:36.960
He'd better not go to Nanjing if he can.

00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:40.750
Go now.

00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:43.940
Also, take a look at

00:17:44.310 --> 00:17:45.310
what kind of woman

00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:47.570
a man like him would choose as his wife.

00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:49.510
Got it.

00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:52.030
You're giving me too much credit.

00:17:52.030 --> 00:17:53.590
How could someone insignificant like me

00:17:53.590 --> 00:17:54.720
possibly earn the favor

00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:55.960
of a great merchant like your father?

00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:57.790
Actually, several times
when I barely escaped death,

00:17:57.790 --> 00:17:59.160
he was the one who let me go.

00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:01.160
I should be the one giving him gifts.

00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:04.840
To have barely escaped death

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:05.920
is a good thing.

00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:09.540
There are some things
I can't figure out either.

00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:10.480
Why don't you take me

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:11.680
to greet your wife?

00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:13.820
Just a brief greeting at the door will do.

00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:14.680
Otherwise, I wouldn't know what to say

00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:15.810
when my father asks.

00:18:16.550 --> 00:18:18.210
Let's go. I'll take you there.

00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:30.440
Greetings, Madam.

00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:32.430
I'm here to pay my respect.

00:18:33.350 --> 00:18:34.510
Greetings, Mr. Li.

00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:38.310
We're buddies;

00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:40.960
our relationship is naturally
different from others.

00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:41.480
Go on in

00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:42.720
and chat for a while.

00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:07.880
Here.

00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:11.200
You're so great.

00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:12.530
I knew you'd be hungry.

00:19:16.750 --> 00:19:17.480
Smells good?

00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:18.640
Tastes good?

00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:23.480
It's so good.

00:19:24.590 --> 00:19:25.450
Take your time.

00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:30.610
Give me a hug.

00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:38.090
Enjoy your meal.

00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:40.110
If you want more, just tell me.

00:19:40.110 --> 00:19:42.370
I'll steal more from the kitchen for you.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:43.960
Steal, you say.

00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:47.960
Who is it?

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:48.590
Mr. Gu,

00:19:48.750 --> 00:19:50.000
your buddy Li Qin is leaving

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.730
and wants to say goodbye to you.

00:19:51.820 --> 00:19:53.280
Okay. I'll be right there.

00:19:57.670 --> 00:19:58.880
I'll just have a quick word with him

00:19:58.880 --> 00:19:59.880
and be right back.

00:20:00.070 --> 00:20:00.790
Go ahead.

00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:08.410
Don't just sleep after eating.

00:20:08.790 --> 00:20:09.480
Wait for me.

00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:12.240
I know.

00:20:35.830 --> 00:20:37.830
A moment of spring night
is worth a thousand taels.

00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:38.350
Did I

00:20:38.350 --> 00:20:40.280
interrupt your romantic evening?

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:41.260
What nonsense.

00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:43.410
A true friend is worth more than gold.

00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:46.570
Did Marshal Jiu visit you?

00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:48.440
They want me

00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:50.720
to be the advisor to Ruilin,

00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:52.250
the Viceroy of Liangjiang.

00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:54.880
Is that what you wanted to ask about?

00:20:57.640 --> 00:21:00.440
The situation in Nanjing
is very complicated now.

00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:02.880
That place is extremely dangerous
right now.

00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:04.610
All factions are active there.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:06.660
Half of the land is conquered.

00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:08.920
Who wouldn't want to get involved

00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:10.340
and get a piece of the pie?

00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:12.480
But Marshal Jiu,

00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:14.890
after years of bloody battles,

00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:17.600
would never willingly
give up his interests.

00:21:17.790 --> 00:21:19.290
I think he's pushing someone like you,

00:21:19.290 --> 00:21:20.610
who fears nothing,

00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:21.590
to take the fall.

00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:22.510
How vicious.

00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:25.400
Your Li family

00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:27.580
also wants a foothold in Nanjing?

00:21:27.690 --> 00:21:28.290
Of course.

00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:31.840
My father was entrusted by His Highness

00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:34.200
to take control
of the southern salt administration.

00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:36.200
It's a juicy piece of meat after all.

00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:40.640
The salt administration is the foundation

00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:41.970
of the empire's wealth.

00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:43.570
Taking control of it

00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:45.210
is indeed a brilliant move.

00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:47.810
Before I came, my father

00:21:48.310 --> 00:21:49.570
left this matter to me.

00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:51.110
Success is

00:21:51.550 --> 00:21:52.410
my only option.

00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:54.820
So you have to give me some leeway.

00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:56.310
Okay.

00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:57.520
I promise you.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:08.730
I don't really

00:22:08.730 --> 00:22:09.590
buy your words.

00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:12.000
But you saying it

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:13.860
at least honors our brotherhood.

00:22:14.510 --> 00:22:15.910
Why don't you believe me?

00:22:16.070 --> 00:22:17.310
After I took this assignment,

00:22:17.310 --> 00:22:18.970
I thought about it seriously.

00:22:20.070 --> 00:22:21.670
Marshal Jiu has his eye on you

00:22:21.790 --> 00:22:22.920
and wants to use you.

00:22:23.350 --> 00:22:24.550
My father knows that.

00:22:25.630 --> 00:22:27.040
The reason he assigned

00:22:27.070 --> 00:22:29.030
the salt administration matters to me

00:22:29.030 --> 00:22:30.890
isn't because he truly trusts me,

00:22:31.510 --> 00:22:33.570
but because he thinks putting me here

00:22:34.110 --> 00:22:35.310
will make it harder

00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:36.750
for you to do your job.

00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:45.890
These people are using us as pawns.

00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:49.500
But there's something

00:22:49.550 --> 00:22:50.590
I want to tell you.

00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:54.720
Even if someday

00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:57.590
we brothers truly become

00:22:57.960 --> 00:22:58.740
enemies,

00:23:00.350 --> 00:23:01.610
business is business.

00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:03.590
I won't harm you.

00:23:07.530 --> 00:23:08.390
I won't either.

00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:31.270
I was afraid you weren't full enough.

00:23:31.270 --> 00:23:32.400
So I got you two more.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:34.310
I'm done eating.

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:36.480
Don't tell anyone else

00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:38.000
that I ate so much.

00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:44.960
Wow, you're quite particular.

00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:46.960
You left just 1 of everything for me.

00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:50.180
Didn't you say you wouldn't let me sleep?

00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:51.350
Yes.

I don't know what we're supposed to do.

I just came from the capital.

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:16.920
I met with the Emperor.

00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:19.300
I heard you were getting married.

00:25:19.590 --> 00:25:20.390
Why didn't you

00:25:20.750 --> 00:25:22.510

Never. Not even for a single day.

00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:34.940
And friendship runs deep.

00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:36.570
Please have a drink.

00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:38.200
When it's in the bottle,

00:28:38.270 --> 00:28:39.880
it's as tranquil as plain water.

00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:41.480
When poured into a glass for you,

00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:43.110
it becomes a liquor fierce as a tiger.

00:28:43.110 --> 00:28:44.550
Our songs ring out loud.

00:28:44.750 --> 00:28:46.210
And friendship runs deep.

00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:47.720
Please have a drink.

00:29:08.990 --> 00:29:10.110
They dance so well.

00:29:11.550 --> 00:29:12.750
I'm truly impressed.

00:29:19.350 --> 00:29:21.410
I didn't drink myself to death, did I?

00:29:22.110 --> 00:29:23.370
You're finally alive?

00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:27.090
Where is His Highness?

00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:28.960
He left the next day.

00:29:29.070 --> 00:29:29.880
He wants us

00:29:30.510 --> 00:29:32.310
to visit Horqin again next year.

00:29:32.830 --> 00:29:33.560
Sounds good.

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:36.060
I'll wait until next year to die then.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:38.000
Do you remember

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.800
how you cried while
hugging His Highness that day?

00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:42.500
I didn't, did I?

00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:44.270
No one could understand
what you were saying.

00:29:44.270 --> 00:29:46.470
It took several people to pull you away.

00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:49.720
You're making this up, aren't you?

00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:50.640
Why do I recall that

00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:51.990
I passed out early

00:29:52.050 --> 00:29:53.350
and just collapsed?

00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:56.730
His Highness even promised you his sword.

00:29:57.110 --> 00:30:00.200
He also said he'd make you Horqin's...

00:30:02.830 --> 00:30:03.550
Baturu.

00:30:03.790 --> 00:30:04.680
What Turu?

00:30:06.550 --> 00:30:07.310
Baturu.

00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:10.200
It means

00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:11.830
warrior.

00:30:16.350 --> 00:30:17.350
Some warrior I am.

00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:22.350
You've been drunk for a day.

00:30:22.350 --> 00:30:23.650
Eat something. Here.

00:30:23.830 --> 00:30:25.030
Don't make me eat now.

00:30:25.110 --> 00:30:26.040
I feel terrible.

00:30:27.830 --> 00:30:28.880
My father said

00:30:29.070 --> 00:30:30.680
eating a little would sober you up.

00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:31.200
Be good.

00:30:31.750 --> 00:30:33.540
My whole body is

00:30:33.590 --> 00:30:34.880
in turmoil.

00:30:35.550 --> 00:30:37.030
One bite and I'll throw up.

00:30:42.750 --> 00:30:43.640
Take one bite

00:30:44.310 --> 00:30:45.400
and I'll let you

00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:46.510
hug me.

00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:49.930
Give it here.

00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:09.460
Have another bite.

00:31:18.950 --> 00:31:22.410
[Gu's Mansion]

00:31:23.130 --> 00:31:25.740
[Spring Breeze of Yi River]

00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:31.440
Mother.

00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:33.160
Here.

00:31:33.350 --> 00:31:34.960
Don't just say it's good.

00:31:35.070 --> 00:31:36.270
Tell me if there's any problem.

00:31:36.270 --> 00:31:37.200
I'll make adjustments.

00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:39.110
So I'll know exactly what to do next time.

00:31:39.110 --> 00:31:39.920
Alright.

00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:41.880
I'm not that picky.

00:31:45.270 --> 00:31:46.350
I cooked too much lately,

00:31:46.350 --> 00:31:47.880
but it's really not my fault.

00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:48.790
Who knew in this house

00:31:48.790 --> 00:31:50.480
I'd be the only real man left standing.

00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:51.070
Look at

00:31:51.270 --> 00:31:51.880
Mr. Chang,

00:31:52.150 --> 00:31:52.810
Mr. Liao,

00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:54.060
and my brother.

00:31:54.510 --> 00:31:55.270
They barely had a few drinks

00:31:55.270 --> 00:31:56.800
before they all passed out.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:58.030
Hurry up and eat.

00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:00.550
I've been eating leftovers for days.

00:32:00.550 --> 00:32:02.280
Let them sleep a little longer.

00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:07.070
You're awake.

00:32:07.070 --> 00:32:07.670
Pingyuan.

00:32:08.030 --> 00:32:08.760
Come eat now.

00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:15.060
Mother, how long was I out for?

00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:16.790
Three days.

00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:18.880
You must be starving.

00:32:19.510 --> 00:32:20.310
Eat quickly.

00:32:20.750 --> 00:32:22.200
Yu'er cooked today.

00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:30.400
Look at you.

00:32:31.420 --> 00:32:32.550
Getting that drunk.

00:32:33.110 --> 00:32:35.570
You've made history
with how drunk you were.

00:32:36.070 --> 00:32:37.480
Your snoring was so loud that

00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:39.280
the whole village could hear it.

00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:46.410
I'm done eating.

00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:47.630
Slow down.

00:32:47.750 --> 00:32:49.350
No one's fighting you for it.

00:32:59.590 --> 00:33:00.350
Did you make this?

00:33:00.350 --> 00:33:01.960
Your cooking skills are good.

00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:03.490
So you can taste things now?

00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:05.330
I remember you told me

00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:07.880
I could hug you for every bite I take.

00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:11.340
Your memory works fine when it suits you.

00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:14.180
A moment of spring night
is worth a thousand gold...

00:33:14.180 --> 00:33:15.550
I've lost out completely.

00:33:15.550 --> 00:33:16.820
I brought a wife home

00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:18.620
and slept for 3 days straight.

00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:21.920
Wife.

00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:27.030
My dear wife.

00:33:27.060 --> 00:33:28.120
What are you doing?

00:33:28.510 --> 00:33:29.590
How did I not notice before

00:33:29.590 --> 00:33:30.590
that you're so...

00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:31.790
So what?

00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:34.720
Shameless.

00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:36.590
In front of you,

00:33:36.610 --> 00:33:37.940
what do I need shame for?

00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:40.110
What I mean is

00:33:40.510 --> 00:33:41.910
tonight, no matter what,

00:33:42.070 --> 00:33:43.730
we'll have our wedding night.

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:45.060
Our wedding night?

00:33:46.030 --> 00:33:47.350
I'd like to see who dares to stop me.

00:33:47.350 --> 00:33:48.220
Mr. Gu.

00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:53.310
Sir.

00:33:55.240 --> 00:33:56.570
Who are you looking for?

00:33:58.070 --> 00:33:59.590
I'm Commander Zhang Erhu

00:33:59.590 --> 00:34:00.240
of the Tiger Battalion.

00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:01.970
Paying my respects to you, sir.

00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:03.700
I'm not any kind of sir.

00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:05.270
You don't need to bow like this.

00:34:05.270 --> 00:34:06.000
Please rise.

00:34:08.510 --> 00:34:09.920
Sir, you are the imperial
Pacification Commissioner.

00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:10.920
Have you forgotten?

00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:12.440
His Excellency sent us here.

00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:14.070
He said that although
you hold no official position,

00:34:14.070 --> 00:34:15.320
you have a noble status.

00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:16.840
He ordered us not to be disrespectful.

00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:18.190
We were afraid of being improper,

00:34:18.190 --> 00:34:19.000
so we posted men to keep watch

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:20.190
until you sobered up.

00:34:20.190 --> 00:34:20.800
Only then did we brothers

00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:22.800
dare to come in and pay our respects.

00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:24.710
You're from
the Liangjiang Viceroy's Office?

00:34:24.710 --> 00:34:25.880
His Excellency is waiting

00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:27.070
for you in Nanjing.

00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:29.440
Let's leave after you finish eating,

00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:29.880
Mr. Gu.

00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:31.710
You're going out?

00:34:31.710 --> 00:34:33.020
Why didn't you tell me?

00:34:33.110 --> 00:34:33.550
No,

00:34:33.630 --> 00:34:34.800
where am I supposed to go?

00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:36.550
We're escorting you to Nanjing, of course.

00:34:36.550 --> 00:34:38.360
Didn't you promise His Excellency

00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:40.320
that you'd start work 3 days
after your wedding?

00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:41.449
It's been 3 days now.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:42.960
How can I just leave? I...

00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:44.360
I need to prepare first.

00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:45.770
May I ask

00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:47.110
what preparations you need?

00:34:47.110 --> 00:34:48.570
My men can help you.

00:34:49.150 --> 00:34:49.920
Well, you see,

00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:50.920
I just got married

00:34:51.590 --> 00:34:52.840
and I have a big family,

00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:54.030
I can't just leave whenever I want.

00:34:54.030 --> 00:34:55.360
His Excellency has instructed us on this.

00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:56.800
He said that you are a filial son.

00:34:56.800 --> 00:34:57.800
So no matter what,

00:34:57.840 --> 00:34:59.150
we're to bring your entire family

00:34:59.150 --> 00:35:00.150
to Nanjing with you.

00:35:00.150 --> 00:35:02.000
This way, you won't miss your parents

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:03.360
and be unable to focus on your work.

00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:04.820
We'll be waiting outside.

00:35:05.190 --> 00:35:06.190
When you finish eating,

00:35:06.190 --> 00:35:06.880
just let us know.

00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:08.410
We'll depart immediately.

00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:11.440
My respects to you, Sir.

00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:12.920
My respects, Sir.

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:22.570
So...

00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:25.280
Too late for your wedding night?

00:35:25.550 --> 00:35:27.150
Too late to even kill myself.

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:47.800
Gentlemen,

00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:49.150
it's just one more day and night

00:35:49.150 --> 00:35:50.510
before we reach Jiangning.

00:35:50.510 --> 00:35:51.850
You don't need to stand here like this.

00:35:51.850 --> 00:35:52.440
It must be tiring.

00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:53.240
Go in and rest.

00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:53.960
Mr. Gu.

00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:56.770
Standing guard for you

00:35:56.920 --> 00:35:57.720
is not tiring.

00:35:57.800 --> 00:35:59.530
My mother thinks you're tired.

00:35:59.820 --> 00:36:01.150
She specifically instructed me

00:36:01.150 --> 00:36:02.280
to insist that you gentlemen

00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:03.510
go and rest in the cabin.

00:36:03.510 --> 00:36:05.070
Refreshments have been prepared
in the cabin.

00:36:05.070 --> 00:36:06.530
Relax and have a good chat.

00:36:06.630 --> 00:36:07.690
We'll arrive soon.

00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:08.320
Alright.

00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:08.960
-Alright.
-Alright.

00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:10.620
Then you take the first shift.

00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:14.960
Please.

00:36:30.630 --> 00:36:32.280
Where are you from, General Li?

00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:33.590
I'm from Liuyang.

00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:34.780
Liuyang, I see.

00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:36.070
Mr. Gu,

00:36:37.230 --> 00:36:38.560
in Nanjing,

00:36:38.710 --> 00:36:40.480
hundreds of thousands of troops
are stranded.

00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:42.000
The imperial court wants to disband them,

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:43.460
but can't pay their wages.

00:36:43.880 --> 00:36:45.480
The resentment among the men

00:36:45.550 --> 00:36:47.280
is growing stronger by the day.

00:36:48.030 --> 00:36:48.710
Mr. Gu,

00:36:49.630 --> 00:36:52.760
these soldiers have fought bloody battles
for 10 years.

00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:54.820
They're not ordinary civilians.

00:36:54.990 --> 00:36:56.300
Even we commanders

00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:57.980
are afraid.

00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:00.920
Jiangning

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:03.260
is about to become a powder keg, isn't it?

00:37:04.030 --> 00:37:04.630
That's why

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:06.530
we need a master strategist

00:37:06.710 --> 00:37:08.910
to manage and stabilize the situation.

00:37:09.550 --> 00:37:10.950
When we brothers set out,

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:12.060
we were instructed

00:37:12.070 --> 00:37:14.000
that if you lost even a single hair,

00:37:14.070 --> 00:37:15.340
all four of us brothers

00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:17.510
would have to forfeit our heads.

00:37:18.190 --> 00:37:19.880
You all know perfectly well

00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:22.490
that you're pushing me into a fire pit.

00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:23.560
Right now,

00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:26.110
the morale of the troops
is quite unstable, isn't it?

00:37:26.110 --> 00:37:26.920
Indeed,

00:37:27.190 --> 00:37:29.190
it's been almost a year without pay.

00:37:29.790 --> 00:37:30.590
But Sir,

00:37:31.110 --> 00:37:33.550
none of us truly wants to rebel.

00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:35.560
However, if pushed too hard,

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:38.130
men accustomed to bloodshed

00:37:38.190 --> 00:37:39.590
might cause chaos again.

00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:42.660
It's frightening just to think about it.

00:37:42.700 --> 00:37:43.900
That must not happen.

00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:45.880
When I was in Shanghai before,

00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:48.510
I saw those foreigners with
their powerful warships and cannons.

00:37:48.510 --> 00:37:50.040
They were like wild beasts,

00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:52.250
ready to devour anyone they chose.

00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:54.480
Our country has been weak for so long.

00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:55.400
If another conflict happens,

00:37:55.400 --> 00:37:57.400
the entire nation will be finished.

00:37:58.670 --> 00:37:59.660
I

00:37:59.920 --> 00:38:01.650
will do everything in my power.

00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:05.030
Sir, you have such a compassionate heart.

00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:05.800
The four of us brothers

00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:07.230
will ensure your safety

00:38:07.510 --> 00:38:08.190
even if

00:38:08.710 --> 00:38:09.880
it costs our lives.

00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:13.110
May you succeed
in all your endeavors, Mr. Gu.

00:38:13.110 --> 00:38:14.370
May I succeed, indeed.

00:38:14.670 --> 00:38:16.730
Alright, I'll take your good wishes.

00:38:21.110 --> 00:38:22.230
I know you've been drunk

00:38:22.230 --> 00:38:23.490
the past few days, Sir.

00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:24.590
Today,

00:38:25.070 --> 00:38:27.470
you'll consummate your marriage on board.

00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:28.880
I've specially prepared

00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:30.540
an opera troupe and a drum band

00:38:31.030 --> 00:38:32.560
to set the mood for you, Sir.

00:38:34.030 --> 00:38:35.560
How do you know everything?

00:38:35.670 --> 00:38:36.630
That's not necessary.

00:38:36.630 --> 00:38:37.000
Sir.

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:37.860
Not necessary!

00:38:38.710 --> 00:38:39.440
Sir.

00:39:31.030 --> 00:39:31.890
Let me taste it.

00:39:38.150 --> 00:39:39.210
Why is this so sour?

00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:40.010
What is this?

00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:41.170
Fruit juice?

00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:43.170
Sir,

00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:44.340
this is pear juice.

00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:46.690
It's for rinsing your mouth after eating.

00:39:47.030 --> 00:39:47.510
That's enough.

00:39:47.510 --> 00:39:48.550
You don't need to wait on us anymore.

00:39:48.550 --> 00:39:49.230
And you all.

00:39:49.510 --> 00:39:50.150
You may go.

00:39:51.230 --> 00:39:51.920
Yes.

00:40:01.190 --> 00:40:02.110
Come, Mother.

00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:04.340
Have some chicken.

00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:07.150
Mr. Chang,

00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:08.820
this is for you.

00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:11.960
This piece is bigger,

00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:12.760
for Mr. Liao.

00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:15.610
Everyone else, please help yourself.

00:40:19.670 --> 00:40:20.800
What's wrong

00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:22.000
with all of you?

00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:25.450
Look at this spread.

00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:27.440
Chicken, duck, fish, shrimp, and goose.

00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:28.590
Were they your relatives?

00:40:28.590 --> 00:40:29.910
Even if they were, they're cooked now.

00:40:29.910 --> 00:40:30.580
Eat up.

00:40:31.480 --> 00:40:32.000
Be quiet

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:33.730
if you have nothing good to say.

00:40:34.670 --> 00:40:36.000
Everyone is looking so gloomy

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:37.840
like you've boarded a pirate ship.

00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:39.370
You've ruined my appetite.

00:40:44.190 --> 00:40:44.840
Pingyuan.

00:40:47.150 --> 00:40:49.080
What trouble have you gotten into?

00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:53.210
I don't know.

00:40:54.710 --> 00:40:56.710
Such humble words and lavish gifts.

00:40:56.890 --> 00:40:57.880
It seems

00:40:58.510 --> 00:41:00.070
they want to buy your life.

00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:06.410
If they only wanted my life,

00:41:06.710 --> 00:41:07.770
that would be fine.

00:41:08.230 --> 00:41:09.630
But they've gone too far.

00:41:10.760 --> 00:41:13.090
They're betting my whole family's lives.

00:41:14.920 --> 00:41:15.580
Whose life?

00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:18.280
Don't you know

00:41:18.510 --> 00:41:19.150
I'm going to Nanjing

00:41:19.150 --> 00:41:20.110
to handle something?

00:41:20.110 --> 00:41:20.880
I know.

00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:22.670
Aren't you going to Nanjing

00:41:22.670 --> 00:41:23.670
to be an official?

00:41:24.230 --> 00:41:25.360
It's not that.

00:41:26.440 --> 00:41:28.170
If this matter is handled well,

00:41:28.710 --> 00:41:30.040
we can all return alive.

00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:32.480
But if it's not handled well,

00:41:34.360 --> 00:41:35.360
all of us here

00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:36.760
will be beheaded.

00:41:39.510 --> 00:41:39.960
Gosh.

00:41:40.630 --> 00:41:41.230
Pingyuan.

00:41:43.030 --> 00:41:44.160
I don't understand.

00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:45.920
When others become officials,

00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:47.000
they make fortunes

00:41:47.360 --> 00:41:49.090
and marry several concubines.

00:41:49.150 --> 00:41:50.090
But you?

00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:51.000
You've put my head

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:52.190
on the line too.

00:41:56.590 --> 00:41:57.670
One year ago...

00:42:00.030 --> 00:42:02.490
Rogue soldiers passed through the village.

00:42:02.710 --> 00:42:03.480
Everyone in the village

00:42:03.480 --> 00:42:05.280
hid in the caves.

00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:09.340
The soldiers loitered
for more than 10 days.

00:42:10.190 --> 00:42:12.400
Everyone had nothing to eat or drink,

00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:13.400
and it was so cold.

00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:17.140
But we didn't dare to light a fire.

00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:18.440
That time,

00:42:19.150 --> 00:42:21.280
dozens of children and elderly people

00:42:21.360 --> 00:42:23.440
fell asleep and never woke up again.

00:42:24.630 --> 00:42:26.150
They starved to death.

00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:29.360
Life isn't ours to control.

00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:33.070
Heaven takes it whenever it wants.

00:42:33.550 --> 00:42:35.480
But wasn't that because of the war?

00:42:37.070 --> 00:42:38.070
So, why now...

00:42:45.790 --> 00:42:46.720
Do you regret it?

00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:52.530
Son-in-law,

00:42:53.110 --> 00:42:55.040
I just want to ask you one question.

00:42:55.880 --> 00:42:57.250
Are they asking you

00:42:57.280 --> 00:42:58.840
to do anything immoral?

00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:02.280
No.
