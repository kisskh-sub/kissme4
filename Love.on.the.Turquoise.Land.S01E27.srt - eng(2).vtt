It's fine.

00:02:47.671 --> 00:02:48.591
Don't misfire.

00:02:49.271 --> 00:02:50.032
It's for me?

Though it's a tranquilizer gun,

00:02:51.376 --> 00:02:52.472
it could knock you out

00:02:52.472 --> 00:02:53.551
for at least two days.

00:02:54.032 --> 00:02:54.671
Understood.

00:02:54.912 --> 00:02:56.032
I can only offer this help.

00:02:56.671 --> 00:02:57.871
When we reach the Golden Gate,

00:02:58.151 --> 00:02:59.232
it's every man for himself.

This is a treasure.

00:04:38.552 --> 00:04:39.151
Hello?

00:04:39.752 --> 00:04:40.952
Shen, what's your status?

00:04:41.552 --> 00:04:43.192
We just arrived. How about you?

00:04:43.831 --> 00:04:44.512
Positioned.

00:04:44.591 --> 00:04:45.872
Then let's proceed as planned.

00:04:45.872 --> 00:04:47.024
Mine closed in three days.

00:04:47.271 --> 00:04:47.831
Rest assured.

00:04:51.031 --> 00:04:52.432
Watch those Earth Fiends.

00:04:52.831 --> 00:04:55.552
Everything else is the same
as our regular patrols.

00:04:56.632 --> 00:04:57.552
The path is rough.

00:04:58.711 --> 00:04:59.591
Watch your step.

00:05:08.911 --> 00:05:09.632
Let's go.

00:05:10.791 --> 00:05:11.512
Keep up.

00:05:13.192 --> 00:05:14.072
Everyone stay close.

00:05:14.351 --> 00:05:15.432
- Got it.
- Okay.

00:05:16.031 --> 00:05:16.831
- Stay close.
- Move.

00:05:16.872 --> 00:05:17.552
Let's go.

00:05:17.831 --> 00:05:18.432
Okay.

00:06:10.609 --> 00:06:11.568
Keep up.

00:06:28.849 --> 00:06:31.328
Landslide. It's completely blocked.

00:06:32.248 --> 00:06:33.688
Isn't there another route?

00:06:34.049 --> 00:06:35.289
For centuries,

00:06:35.289 --> 00:06:36.049
the Hunters

00:06:36.049 --> 00:06:37.729
pioneered the patrol route.

00:06:38.128 --> 00:06:40.049
It hasn't been updated in ages.

00:06:42.328 --> 00:06:43.849
What about taking Village Four?

00:06:43.888 --> 00:06:46.248
Even Jiang might not
have taken that path.

00:06:46.248 --> 00:06:47.888
Let alone our generation.

00:06:48.008 --> 00:06:49.008
We're not even sure

00:06:49.008 --> 00:06:49.849
if that place exists.

00:06:50.649 --> 00:06:51.849
We can't just sit around.

00:06:51.969 --> 00:06:53.448
Maybe we should split up and search.

00:06:53.448 --> 00:06:55.808
No way. There are Earth Fiends
in the group.

00:06:55.808 --> 00:06:56.928
Splitting up is too risky.

00:06:57.568 --> 00:06:59.729
I think I can find the way
to Village Four.

00:07:02.888 --> 00:07:04.008
How would you know?

00:07:05.248 --> 00:07:06.049
Follow me.

00:07:10.849 --> 00:07:11.808
Everyone, keep up.

00:07:12.008 --> 00:07:13.128
- Okay.
- Okay.

00:07:16.489 --> 00:07:17.489
Stay close.

00:07:56.625 --> 00:07:58.305
You actually found it.

00:07:58.625 --> 00:08:00.625
Read ten thousand books,
walk ten thousand miles.

00:08:13.986 --> 00:08:15.346
The Hunters relocated eight times.

00:08:15.586 --> 00:08:16.666
The first was Qin Village.

00:08:17.666 --> 00:08:19.106
It's right above the Golden Gate.

00:08:19.466 --> 00:08:21.346
That's where we're camping this time.

00:08:22.825 --> 00:08:25.226
Village Four is another outpost.

00:08:25.602 --> 00:08:27.265
Founded about 400 years
after Qin Village.

00:08:29.265 --> 00:08:31.466
The current Nanshan Rescue base
is the best.

00:08:32.185 --> 00:08:34.825
It's discreet, convenient, and modern,

00:08:36.185 --> 00:08:38.185
with a rescue org as the cover.

00:08:38.185 --> 00:08:39.586
Hiding in plain sight indeed.

00:08:41.586 --> 00:08:42.625
Someone was here lately.

00:08:49.385 --> 00:08:50.826
Have the team check the perimeter.

00:08:52.586 --> 00:08:53.425
Check ahead.

00:08:54.826 --> 00:08:56.425
Could it be hikers?

00:08:56.425 --> 00:08:58.226
Or illegal loggers?

00:08:59.066 --> 00:08:59.785
Hard to say.

00:09:00.866 --> 00:09:01.905
This isn't a usual route.

00:09:02.025 --> 00:09:03.346
Patrols rarely come this way.

00:09:03.826 --> 00:09:04.946
We don't know this area.

00:09:04.946 --> 00:09:05.706
Better not linger.

00:09:05.745 --> 00:09:07.625
So we're pushing to Qin Village tonight.

00:09:18.625 --> 00:09:19.625
Take five here.

00:09:38.106 --> 00:09:39.787
Luo, have a bite first.

00:09:40.427 --> 00:09:41.866
Once we set up camp at Qin Village,

00:09:41.946 --> 00:09:42.986
we'll have a hot meal.

00:09:44.346 --> 00:09:45.946
Luo, look.

00:09:46.826 --> 00:09:49.627
Isn't this identical to the statue

00:09:49.787 --> 00:09:52.427
at the Temple of the Righteous Lord
you showed me?

00:09:54.187 --> 00:09:55.187
It is similar.

00:09:55.787 --> 00:09:56.787
But it's not surprising.

00:09:56.946 --> 00:09:57.586
This whole area

00:09:57.586 --> 00:09:59.066
is South Mountain Hunters' territory.

00:10:00.787 --> 00:10:01.507
I see.

00:10:07.586 --> 00:10:08.307
What's so funny?

00:10:09.147 --> 00:10:09.746
Nothing.

00:10:10.267 --> 00:10:13.267
Just remembered
how you used to be ice-cold

00:10:13.267 --> 00:10:14.027
and aloof.

00:10:14.507 --> 00:10:15.346
Keep your voice down.

00:10:16.106 --> 00:10:16.907
Let's go.

00:10:23.627 --> 00:10:24.706
Guo, keep watch on them.

00:10:25.226 --> 00:10:25.907
Got it.

00:10:58.027 --> 00:10:58.667
Guo.

00:11:01.907 --> 00:11:02.946
Canned beef.

00:11:06.387 --> 00:11:07.346
Had enough rest?

00:11:07.427 --> 00:11:08.226
Time to move on.

00:11:09.267 --> 00:11:10.187
Unfamiliar area ahead.

00:11:10.346 --> 00:11:12.027
I'll take a few buddies to scout ahead.

00:11:12.307 --> 00:11:13.907
Follow only after we confirm it's clear.

00:11:14.706 --> 00:11:15.346
Okay.

00:11:16.027 --> 00:11:17.226
I'll leave markers on the way.

00:11:17.267 --> 00:11:18.346
Just follow them.

00:11:20.986 --> 00:11:22.946
Qiang, Sun Li, pack your gear
and come with me.

00:11:23.106 --> 00:11:24.147
Let's go too.

00:11:24.147 --> 00:11:24.826
We may help.

00:12:32.307 --> 00:12:33.027
What's wrong?

00:12:34.466 --> 00:12:35.147
Nothing.

00:12:48.226 --> 00:12:48.866
Qiang.

00:12:54.627 --> 00:12:57.346
Doesn't this path look familiar?

00:12:58.706 --> 00:13:00.706
Don't all mountain paths look alike?

00:13:01.267 --> 00:13:01.866
No.

00:13:02.466 --> 00:13:03.466
Something does feel off.

00:13:04.106 --> 00:13:05.106
What feels off?

00:13:05.986 --> 00:13:07.106
Everything feels off here.

00:13:08.866 --> 00:13:09.547
Stay sharp.

00:13:12.706 --> 00:13:13.387
Stay sharp.

00:13:26.946 --> 00:13:28.986
What do you think their lair looks like?

00:13:30.547 --> 00:13:32.267
Exactly like in the drawings.

00:13:42.147 --> 00:13:43.187
Are you talking to it?

00:13:46.307 --> 00:13:51.387
What do you think the birds,
beasts, and plants here

00:13:51.986 --> 00:13:53.066
see us as?

00:13:55.907 --> 00:13:56.706
As trespassers.

00:14:07.346 --> 00:14:08.307
And the Earth Fiends?

00:14:09.106 --> 00:14:11.187
You're not trying
to understand them, are you?

00:14:13.387 --> 00:14:14.787
Understanding them isn't hard.

00:14:16.106 --> 00:14:19.147
In this world, problems
far trickier than Earth Fiends

00:14:20.267 --> 00:14:20.986
are way too many.

00:14:21.746 --> 00:14:23.106
Let's deal with them

00:14:24.187 --> 00:14:25.466
before facing new problems.

00:14:27.226 --> 00:14:29.787
Yes. Every barrier seems insurmountable
until we break through.

00:14:43.387 --> 00:14:44.187
Scared?

00:14:45.106 --> 00:14:46.466
Don't treat me like a child.

00:14:48.427 --> 00:14:50.706
Something's fishy. Stay alert.

00:14:52.507 --> 00:14:53.187
What's that?

00:14:55.027 --> 00:14:56.986
Could you stop jumping at shadows?

00:14:58.346 --> 00:14:59.547
What else could it be?

00:15:00.027 --> 00:15:01.187
Wraith fire or something?

00:15:02.387 --> 00:15:03.826
Who'd make a fire out here?

00:15:05.187 --> 00:15:05.826
Stay alert.

00:15:48.066 --> 00:15:49.027
I almost forgot.

00:15:49.986 --> 00:15:52.267
Mad Dog's nose is extremely valuable.

00:16:00.986 --> 00:16:02.267
Not your first time here, right?

00:16:06.346 --> 00:16:07.307
Do you know

00:16:07.907 --> 00:16:10.586
why in every social animal group,

00:16:12.147 --> 00:16:13.946
there are always those
who leave the pack

00:16:14.706 --> 00:16:16.027
to live solitary lives?

00:16:17.187 --> 00:16:18.627
Where they go

00:16:19.986 --> 00:16:21.147
is actually determined

00:16:21.907 --> 00:16:23.307
by Earth's magnetic field.

00:16:24.946 --> 00:16:25.986
Being solitary

00:16:26.907 --> 00:16:28.907
isn't necessarily about being eccentric

00:16:29.627 --> 00:16:30.866
but because

00:16:31.346 --> 00:16:33.147
they resonate at a different frequency.

00:16:33.627 --> 00:16:34.307
But...

00:16:36.346 --> 00:16:37.706
going your own way

00:16:38.907 --> 00:16:40.586
often leads to dead ends.

00:16:50.547 --> 00:16:52.187
- What's that sound?
- Something happened.

00:16:55.547 --> 00:16:56.547
Something happened.

00:16:56.706 --> 00:16:57.907
Wake up. Stop sleeping.

00:16:58.746 --> 00:16:59.507
It's us.

00:17:00.387 --> 00:17:01.667
Why are you coming from there?

00:17:01.746 --> 00:17:02.547
What happened?

00:17:02.547 --> 00:17:03.427
What's going on?

00:17:03.627 --> 00:17:04.387
Why are they back?

00:17:04.427 --> 00:17:05.627
Yeah, why this direction?

00:17:11.586 --> 00:17:12.307
You...

00:17:14.106 --> 00:17:14.946
We walked in circles.

00:17:17.786 --> 00:17:18.627
Walked in circles?

00:17:20.466 --> 00:17:21.986
So you couldn't find the way out

00:17:21.986 --> 00:17:23.026
and circled again.

00:17:23.026 --> 00:17:24.187
Could it be

00:17:24.627 --> 00:17:25.907
a trap

00:17:26.387 --> 00:17:27.506
set by the ancestors

00:17:27.506 --> 00:17:28.786
of the South Mountain Hunters?

00:17:29.067 --> 00:17:29.907
Why?

00:17:30.147 --> 00:17:32.266
This was South Mountain Hunters'
territory.

00:17:32.587 --> 00:17:34.667
It's totally normal
that they'd set a trap

00:17:34.907 --> 00:17:36.587
against outsiders
or Earth Fiends, right?

00:17:37.746 --> 00:17:40.306
But why trap their own people?

00:17:40.827 --> 00:17:42.746
Maybe they never expected so many

00:17:42.746 --> 00:17:44.466
of their own to spring the trap.

00:17:44.506 --> 00:17:45.107
Right?

00:17:53.266 --> 00:17:54.946
Mad Dog leads the charge,

00:17:55.667 --> 00:17:57.266
Mad Blade sits in the central tent,

00:17:58.067 --> 00:17:59.786
and Ghost Whip cracks his glowing whip.

00:18:03.347 --> 00:18:04.746
If we map this village's layout

00:18:04.746 --> 00:18:06.706
to the South Mountain Hunters'
formation,

00:18:11.026 --> 00:18:12.667
that hillside ahead

00:18:13.347 --> 00:18:14.506
represents Mad Dog.

00:18:25.306 --> 00:18:27.026
And that moonlit tree

00:18:27.506 --> 00:18:28.546
stands for Ghost Whip.

00:18:34.187 --> 00:18:37.187
Then this statue must be Mad Blade.

00:19:18.705 --> 00:19:19.786
Interesting.

00:19:48.625 --> 00:19:49.345
Got it.

00:19:53.385 --> 00:19:54.226
It's a bronze mirror.

00:19:55.345 --> 00:19:56.186
Here's another one.

00:20:03.825 --> 00:20:04.825
They each found one.

00:20:05.186 --> 00:20:06.506
Seems my guess was correct.

00:20:21.105 --> 00:20:22.105
Is it possible

00:20:22.226 --> 00:20:24.746
that the mechanism
isn't on the statue at all?

00:21:10.097 --> 00:21:11.736
I-It's also the Mad Blade?

00:22:18.961 --> 00:22:20.600
That should be the right path.

00:22:30.353 --> 00:22:31.314
Enough rest.

00:22:31.673 --> 00:22:33.433
Pack up and head out.

00:22:45.137 --> 00:22:46.695
Full moon tonight. Gorgeous.

00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:54.192
Shame we can't stay.

00:22:59.984 --> 00:23:00.738
Not bad at all.

00:23:14.225 --> 00:23:14.904
Let's go.

00:23:16.025 --> 00:23:16.624
Let's go.

00:23:18.785 --> 00:23:19.424
Keep up.

00:23:19.424 --> 00:23:20.184
Stay close.

00:23:20.184 --> 00:23:20.825
Hurry.

00:23:22.944 --> 00:23:23.505
Let's go.

00:23:24.104 --> 00:23:24.664
Hurry up.

00:23:28.585 --> 00:23:29.745
Hurry up.

00:23:31.585 --> 00:23:32.144
Hurry up.

00:23:35.985 --> 00:23:36.904
Be careful.

00:23:38.985 --> 00:23:39.864
Mind your step.

00:24:00.177 --> 00:24:01.137
Mind your step.

00:24:09.816 --> 00:24:10.377
Careful.

00:25:05.809 --> 00:25:06.408
Hurry.

00:25:27.057 --> 00:25:28.458
We're finally out.

00:25:31.618 --> 00:25:33.817
Now I see why the patrol route before

00:25:34.218 --> 00:25:35.497
avoided Village Four.

00:25:36.618 --> 00:25:37.497
Push a little harder.

00:25:37.978 --> 00:25:39.738
Let's make up for lost time.

00:25:42.378 --> 00:25:42.938
Are you okay?

00:25:44.378 --> 00:25:45.218
- Let's go.
- Okay.

00:25:46.418 --> 00:25:47.658
- Let's go.
- Hurry.

00:25:49.497 --> 00:25:50.898
Qin Village is within the mountain.

00:25:51.057 --> 00:25:51.978
It's not too far now.

00:25:52.297 --> 00:25:52.938
Let's go.

00:26:16.337 --> 00:26:17.178
Let's camp here.

00:26:17.178 --> 00:26:18.057
- Okay
- Okay.

00:26:20.978 --> 00:26:22.017
Set up camp here.

00:26:23.378 --> 00:26:24.218
Gate opens tomorrow.

00:26:24.738 --> 00:26:25.537
- Okay.
- Okay.

00:26:26.097 --> 00:26:26.898
How about here?

00:26:27.097 --> 00:26:27.817
Is the spot okay?

00:26:27.817 --> 00:26:28.577
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:26:28.577 --> 00:26:29.337
Alright.

00:26:29.378 --> 00:26:30.458
Too many vegetables.

00:26:39.138 --> 00:26:40.537
Take all of them to the back.

00:26:40.817 --> 00:26:43.178
You've kept saying 'Qin Village.'

00:26:43.178 --> 00:26:44.857
I thought it was an actual village.

00:26:46.138 --> 00:26:47.898
Back when the Golden Gate
was first built,

00:26:48.297 --> 00:26:50.418
the Blade, Hound, and Whip clans
each left one family

00:26:50.577 --> 00:26:51.537
to guard this place.

00:26:52.698 --> 00:26:54.698
They lived off the mountain
and were isolated.

00:26:55.938 --> 00:26:57.218
They didn't patrol.

00:26:57.418 --> 00:26:58.658
They guarded here for life.

00:26:59.497 --> 00:27:01.017
Probably to make this isolated place

00:27:01.017 --> 00:27:01.978
feel more like home,

00:27:01.978 --> 00:27:03.698
they gave it this homely name.

00:27:04.057 --> 00:27:04.777
No wonder.

00:27:09.178 --> 00:27:10.698
Are you hungry? Want to eat something?

00:27:11.618 --> 00:27:12.817
You know what I want?

00:27:12.817 --> 00:27:14.297
Of course. Give me your backpack.

00:27:14.658 --> 00:27:15.537
Be careful.

00:27:23.138 --> 00:27:25.138
You carry the Hunters' hopes

00:27:25.257 --> 00:27:27.097
and uphold the Blade Clan's mission.

00:27:27.097 --> 00:27:28.017
Meanwhile,

00:27:28.458 --> 00:27:29.857
you've still found time to date.

00:27:31.178 --> 00:27:33.418
The Mad Blade
truly is a one-in-a-million genius.

00:27:33.497 --> 00:27:34.378
I'm impressed.

00:27:35.978 --> 00:27:37.497
Who knows if we'll make it back up

00:27:37.577 --> 00:27:38.857
once we go down?

00:27:39.497 --> 00:27:41.497
So you're living in the moment.

00:27:43.297 --> 00:27:44.817
I assume you're nervous

00:27:44.817 --> 00:27:46.178
and need some cheering up.

00:27:47.537 --> 00:27:48.698
Then I'll get serious.

00:27:51.497 --> 00:27:52.857
If I'm not mistaken,

00:27:53.178 --> 00:27:55.337
Xing Shen must have been
to Village Four before.

00:27:56.378 --> 00:27:58.017
As for what he went there for,

00:27:59.178 --> 00:28:00.938
maybe only you can get him
to talk about it.

00:28:04.432 --> 00:28:05.986
I don't want to know now.

00:28:07.536 --> 00:28:08.874
Do you still trust him?

00:28:10.288 --> 00:28:11.634
Hard to admit,

00:28:11.634 --> 00:28:14.218
but his faith and loyalty
to the South Mountain Hunters

00:28:14.218 --> 00:28:15.610
outshines us all.

00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:19.153
So as the leader,
he's earned everyone's trust.

00:28:19.153 --> 00:28:21.254
If I doubt him,

00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:23.612
I'm going against the whole group.

00:28:24.688 --> 00:28:26.026
Sounds like

00:28:26.026 --> 00:28:27.666
you're forcing yourself to say it.

00:28:29.392 --> 00:28:30.800
Sounds like you're here

00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:32.785
for a definitive answer
and nothing less, right?

00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:34.096
Not exactly.

00:28:34.512 --> 00:28:37.019
But I do need something from you.

00:29:03.953 --> 00:29:05.585
Xing Shen and I will each lead teams

00:29:05.585 --> 00:29:07.121
through the Golden Gate in sequence.

00:29:07.121 --> 00:29:08.800
We can back each other up for safety.

00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:09.760
Okay.

00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:14.001
The Hound Clan charges first,
with Xing Shen leading.

00:29:14.001 --> 00:29:15.409
Mad Blade sits in the central tent.

00:29:15.409 --> 00:29:16.681
You're with me for rear guard.

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:17.840
No problem.

00:29:25.232 --> 00:29:27.217
You're going home soon.

00:29:27.217 --> 00:29:28.742
How does that feel?

00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:35.231
When Lin Xirou comes,

00:29:38.833 --> 00:29:41.009
all of you will die.

00:29:44.864 --> 00:29:46.064
Told you.

00:29:46.416 --> 00:29:47.953
Watch them hardest

00:29:47.953 --> 00:29:49.291
when home's in sight.

00:29:49.968 --> 00:29:51.441
Once we enter the Twilight Chasm,

00:29:51.441 --> 00:29:52.725
there's no room for your games.

00:29:56.262 --> 00:29:57.264
Put it on yourselves.

00:29:57.264 --> 00:29:58.353
It's for your own good.

00:30:08.923 --> 00:30:09.862
Mad Blade's blood.

00:30:10.416 --> 00:30:12.031
Act up and you get a shot.

00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:14.343
Fewer problems for us.

00:31:12.497 --> 00:31:13.657
Here, try this.

00:31:24.177 --> 00:31:25.098
It's the right taste.

00:31:26.417 --> 00:31:27.457
I just saw you draw blood.

00:31:27.457 --> 00:31:28.618
Eat more. There's plenty.

00:31:34.457 --> 00:31:35.818
What did Yu Rong say to you?

00:31:43.417 --> 00:31:45.898
The plans for entering
the Golden Gate tomorrow.

00:31:48.457 --> 00:31:50.538
How's it going? Everything ready?

00:31:52.177 --> 00:31:53.138
Strangely,

00:31:54.177 --> 00:31:55.898
we're at the Golden Gate's entrance,

00:31:56.098 --> 00:31:57.298
but I'm not nervous at all.

00:31:57.977 --> 00:31:59.257
What's strange about that?

00:31:59.737 --> 00:32:01.737
That reason's perfectly sound.

00:32:02.497 --> 00:32:03.177
Why?

00:32:04.058 --> 00:32:04.737
Look.

00:32:04.898 --> 00:32:05.657
First,

00:32:05.937 --> 00:32:07.417
you're always mentally tough,

00:32:07.657 --> 00:32:09.417
staying calm and composed in any crisis.

00:32:10.697 --> 00:32:11.538
Second,

00:32:11.737 --> 00:32:12.898
with so many Hunters here

00:32:13.177 --> 00:32:14.338
working together,

00:32:14.937 --> 00:32:16.538
we've made thorough preparations.

00:32:17.858 --> 00:32:18.737
Third,

00:32:19.217 --> 00:32:20.657
and most importantly,

00:32:21.457 --> 00:32:22.858
I've been right here with you.

00:32:23.977 --> 00:32:25.378
You should feel reassured.

00:32:34.697 --> 00:32:35.898
Hope you're right,

00:32:35.977 --> 00:32:37.378
and good things ahead.

00:32:37.417 --> 00:32:38.177
Of course.

00:32:39.217 --> 00:32:40.497
Come on. Cheers.

00:32:41.538 --> 00:32:42.778
Good things ahead.

00:32:43.578 --> 00:32:44.257
Cheers.

00:32:46.417 --> 00:32:47.177
Eat more.

00:33:30.058 --> 00:33:30.657
Don't go.

00:33:33.778 --> 00:33:37.417
Yan Tuo. Yan Tuo, help me.

00:33:44.098 --> 00:33:44.618
Luo?

00:33:45.017 --> 00:33:45.657
Luo?

00:33:45.937 --> 00:33:47.177
Luo, wake up. Wake up.

00:33:47.618 --> 00:33:49.177
It's okay. I'm here.

00:33:49.257 --> 00:33:49.858
It's me.

00:33:50.217 --> 00:33:51.017
It's me.

00:34:13.457 --> 00:34:14.177
I'm here.

00:36:08.778 --> 00:36:09.937
Know what that is?

00:36:15.378 --> 00:36:16.697
It looks...

00:36:17.378 --> 00:36:19.058
It looks like a star chart.

00:36:20.058 --> 00:36:21.417
You know quite a bit.

00:36:22.578 --> 00:36:24.578
I've been quite close

00:36:24.578 --> 00:36:25.578
with a sculptor.

00:36:25.578 --> 00:36:26.497
She knows more.

00:36:26.538 --> 00:36:28.657
About traditional stone carving
and sculpture,

00:36:28.657 --> 00:36:29.818
she has taught me a lot.

00:36:30.578 --> 00:36:32.618
The oldest excavated star chart
recognized today

00:36:32.618 --> 00:36:33.898
sits in an overseas museum,

00:36:33.937 --> 00:36:35.618
swindled from us by foreigners.

00:36:35.937 --> 00:36:37.737
Drawn twelve hundred years ago,
they say.

00:36:37.810 --> 00:36:39.858
But the South Mountain Hunters'
stone star chart,

00:36:40.058 --> 00:36:40.898
which is that one,

00:36:40.898 --> 00:36:42.497
has existed for over two thousand years.

00:36:48.737 --> 00:36:50.298
Then how do we get down?

00:36:51.618 --> 00:36:52.497
Well...

00:36:53.657 --> 00:36:55.017
Stop looking. Over there.

00:36:55.417 --> 00:36:56.818
Climb down along the star chart.

00:36:57.618 --> 00:36:58.618
By stepping on this?

00:36:59.298 --> 00:37:00.858
In the past, we had to climb down.

00:37:00.858 --> 00:37:02.138
But it's a new era now.

00:37:02.138 --> 00:37:02.858
We have a lift.

00:37:02.858 --> 00:37:03.618
Right.

00:37:03.937 --> 00:37:05.017
Ask for help if needed.

00:37:05.058 --> 00:37:06.098
Don't trick the silly guy.

00:37:07.378 --> 00:37:08.657
Who are you calling silly?

00:37:09.618 --> 00:37:10.457
Get to work.

00:37:12.178 --> 00:37:12.722
I'll do it.
