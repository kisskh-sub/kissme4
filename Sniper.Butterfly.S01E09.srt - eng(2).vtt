00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:51.260
Go to sleep.

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.930
Alright.

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:59.570
Where's Cheng Rui?

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:00.690
Why isn't he back yet?

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.740
Feichi.

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.690
Where is he?

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:04.660
Well...

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.020
After the evening study,
he got a phone call

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.690
and rushed out.

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:08.940
He should be back soon.

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.850
Alright.

00:02:12.688 --> 00:02:13.955
Where did Zheng Sipeng go?

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:15.660
Sir, he took sick leave.

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:16.730
What should we do?

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:17.940
Surprise dorm check.

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:19.220
Li Wu, quick.

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:20.130
Turn off the desk lamp!

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:22.060
What about Cheng Rui?

00:02:22.133 --> 00:02:24.170
His phone was confiscated
when school started.

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:25.890
Last week, he sneaked into the office

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:27.260
to steal that sports card,

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.010
and the teacher caught him red-handed.

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:30.290
If he gets caught again,

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.260
Mr. Qi will surely expel him directly.

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.290
Hurry. Stuff the pillow into his quilt.

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.690
Quick.

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:36.340
Stuff his quilt.

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:37.200
Stuff his pillow.

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:39.660
Will this really fool them?

00:02:39.866 --> 00:02:40.822
What else can we do?

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:41.410
This...

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:42.660
Try it as a last resort.

00:02:42.933 --> 00:02:44.540
I've passed a check like this before.

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:45.260
Hurry.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:46.010
Stuff it.

00:02:51.888 --> 00:02:53.777
It's so late. Why aren't you sleeping?

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.200
Aren't you having class tomorrow?

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.570
Whose bed is this? Where is the person?

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:05.820
Hello, Sir.

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:18.380
Li Wu's.

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:20.340
Li Wu's bed.

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:26.220
Li Wu from Class 3?

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:27.220
(Absent for the night)

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:32.260
Who knows where he went?

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:33.866
Sir, he went home.

00:03:33.888 --> 00:03:36.288
He said it's cold, and went home
to get a thicker quilt.

00:03:36.288 --> 00:03:37.660
He'll be back
tomorrow morning.

00:03:37.666 --> 00:03:38.088
Yeah.

00:03:38.111 --> 00:03:39.260
Where was he over the weekend?

00:03:39.266 --> 00:03:40.333
Now he says it's cold?

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:41.340
Alright.

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:42.660
Hurry and sleep.

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:43.844
You have class tomorrow.

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:45.340
Okay, Sir.

00:03:46.066 --> 00:03:47.450
Goodbye, Sir.

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:55.820
That scared me.

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:57.100
Got goosebumps all over.

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:58.340
Li Wu.

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:59.730
Not bad.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:01.130
Quite righteous.

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:02.290
If Cheng Rui knew

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:03.100
what you did today,

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:05.820
he'd be moved to tears
and pledge himself to you.

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.100
Good for you, Li Wu.

00:04:07.222 --> 00:04:08.290
What were you thinking?

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:09.940
I was so scared that I froze.

00:04:10.222 --> 00:04:11.260
Didn't you guys say

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.260
if he got caught again,
he'd be expelled?

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:15.340
Yeah.

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:17.780
Let's sleep.

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:20.370
Go to sleep.

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:21.466
All right.

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:31.100
(Mr. Qi)

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:38.900
(Mr. Qi)

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:46.730
Hello, Mr. Qi.

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:47.220
Sorry.

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:48.244
I didn't hear the phone.

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:49.370
Is something wrong?

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:50.220
Cen.

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:53.580
Li Wu didn't return to school all night.

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:55.100
Didn't come back all night?

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:10.050
Mr. Qi, sorry

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:13.220
for making you worry.

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:14.140
You're here.

00:05:17.088 --> 00:05:18.666
Where did you go last night?

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:21.580
I went home.

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:27.460
When is it?

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:30.540
Right after class.

00:05:31.955 --> 00:05:33.444
You worked overtime last night.

00:05:33.688 --> 00:05:35.688
When I fell asleep,
you weren't home yet.

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:37.290
This morning,

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:39.410
I came before you woke up.

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:49.810
Mr. Qi,

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:53.220
can I talk to Li Wu alone?

00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:57.730
Sure.

00:06:01.333 --> 00:06:02.511
Come out for a moment.

00:06:22.288 --> 00:06:23.800
Where did you go last night?

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:30.490
Are you planning to just

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:31.250
stay silent?

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:36.410
I was in the dorm the whole time.

00:06:37.111 --> 00:06:38.688
Then, just now, the teacher asked you.

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:39.930
Why you said you went home?

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:46.020
I covered for my roommate.

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:47.780
Covered for him?

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:48.810
Why?

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:52.340
It was a special situation.

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:55.050
Special situation?

00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:58.370
So just now,

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:00.460
you wanted me to cover your lie?

00:07:03.266 --> 00:07:05.111
Why would you think I would help you?

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:09.490
I don't know...

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:16.850
Li Wu.

00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:18.700
I've been a student too.

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:20.250
I know what you're thinking.

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:21.900
You might feel

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:22.900
that you're being loyal,

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:24.888
but I can't let you act recklessly.

00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:27.100
You came to Yi City,

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:28.866
and your top priority is studying.

00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:30.020
If you feel

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:31.370
losing this opportunity to study

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:32.340
doesn't matter,

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:33.911
then I have nothing to say.

00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:35.540
I can help you cover a lie,

00:07:35.622 --> 00:07:37.888
but I can't take the college exam
for you.

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:39.340
Sorry.

00:07:55.688 --> 00:07:56.888
Why are you laughing?

00:07:57.050 --> 00:07:57.490
Nothing.

00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:02.140
What class is this?

00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:03.250
English.

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:05.580
Alright, enough.

00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:06.340
Go back to class.

00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:07.700
Okay.

00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:16.140
You mean

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:19.340
Li Wu was covering for his roommate?

00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:23.100
Mr. Qi.

00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:25.970
I believe what Li Wu said.

00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:28.020
He has nowhere else to go

00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:29.730
besides school and home.

00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:33.420
But I'm still a bit worried.

00:08:33.770 --> 00:08:35.300
He just came from the mountains,

00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:37.700
and a lot of things

00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:39.460
are new to him,

00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:41.130
even tempting.

00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:43.800
So his surroundings

00:08:43.933 --> 00:08:45.659
and the behavior of the people he meets

00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:47.460
could have a big influence on him.

00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:50.180
Mr. Qi,

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:52.740
you know Li Wu's situation too.

00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:54.940
The NCEE is very important for him.

00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:57.420
I don't want other things to affect him.

00:08:58.780 --> 00:08:59.660
So you mean

00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:01.660
you want to change Li Wu's dorm?

00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:05.060
I'm not sure either.

00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:06.500
After all,

00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:08.100
I'm not his real parent.

00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:15.140
Cen.

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:18.380
I understand your concerns.

00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:20.260
I know these kids

00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:22.060
very well.

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:25.020
Although a few are a bit naughty,

00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:27.980
at heart, they are all good students.

00:09:28.622 --> 00:09:29.820
Their grades are good too.

00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:32.900
Li Wu is very sensible.

00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:35.100
He is goal-oriented.

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:37.020
I believe

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:38.100
he won't be easily

00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:40.420
influenced by the environment.

00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:42.933
Don't worry too much.

00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:43.980
In my experience,

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:46.300
students nowadays

00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:47.780
all have personality.

00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:49.980
They have their own ideas,

00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:51.020
and their own plans.

00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:52.940
Excessive restriction

00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:53.740
is not necessarily

00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:55.260
good for them.

00:09:56.140 --> 00:09:56.820
Of course,

00:09:57.060 --> 00:09:58.380
I will carefully look into

00:09:58.580 --> 00:09:59.860
the situations you worry about.

00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:01.540
Don't worry.

00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:04.180
I will pay extra attention to Li Wu.

00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:08.300
Okay, thank you, Mr. Qi.

00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:10.820
Then I won't disturb you.

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:13.060
Let's communicate if anything comes up.

00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:15.580
Alright.

00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:17.020
Goodbye, Mr. Qi.

00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:17.780
Okay, goodbye.

00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:21.220
Take care.

00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:41.580
Cheng Rui.

00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:43.860
Cheng Rui.

00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:45.700
Cheng Rui.

00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:48.180
What's up?

00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:50.220
It's Mr. Qi.

00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:58.066
Come out with me for a moment.

00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:01.740
What to do?

00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:03.340
Why didn't you remind me earlier?

00:11:04.044 --> 00:11:05.260
I called you several times.

00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:40.300
I hope that from today,

00:11:41.311 --> 00:11:42.911
you take responsibility for yourself.

00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:58.940
What's wrong? What happened?

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.400
Why is the teacher scolding you?

00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:03.340
Is it because of last night?

00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:04.860
No.

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:06.300
Isn't that all in the past?

00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:07.380
How did he know?

00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:07.940
Yeah.

00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:10.180
So it wasn't you two, right?

00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:11.540
Of course not.

00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:12.380
How could we?

00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:12.940
Yeah.

00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:21.580
Then it's him.

00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:23.260
What are you doing?

00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:25.100
I even considered you a brother,

00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:26.820
thought you were loyal

00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:27.740
and felt sorry for you,

00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:28.980
but you

00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:30.660
turned around and sold me out.

00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:32.020
I didn't.

00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:33.820
Your family wants to change your dorm.

00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:34.755
You still deny it?

00:12:37.088 --> 00:12:38.500
Li Wu, if you're upset with me,

00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:39.644
you can say it directly.

00:12:39.755 --> 00:12:41.644
No need to do shady stuff
behind my back.

00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:45.422
Cheng Rui.

00:12:45.933 --> 00:12:46.911
- Cheng Rui.
- Cheng Rui.

00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:48.420
Cheng Rui.

00:12:48.644 --> 00:12:49.260
Don't touch me.

00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:49.940
Cheng Rui.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:50.500
Cheng Rui.

00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:51.260
What are you doing?

00:12:51.288 --> 00:12:52.488
Is there some misunderstanding?

00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:53.100
Yeah.

00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:54.380
What did Mr. Qi say?

00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:56.444
What misunderstanding could there be?

00:12:56.460 --> 00:12:58.377
If he didn't want to help,
he could refuse.

00:12:58.400 --> 00:12:59.044
Did I beg him?

00:12:59.066 --> 00:13:00.800
I didn't want
to involve you guys at first.

00:13:00.888 --> 00:13:01.622
No.

00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:02.460
Cheng Rui.

00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:07.460
Can you explain clearly?

00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:11.620
What's there to say?

00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:14.444
So eager to clear yourself

00:13:14.444 --> 00:13:15.660
of the blame you took yesterday,

00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:17.111
pretending to be the good guy, huh?

00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:19.020
Thanks to you,

00:13:19.577 --> 00:13:20.620
now I'm the one who dares

00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:23.066
to act but not take responsibility,
and corrupts good students.

00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:23.660
Thanks.

00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:25.620
Cheng Rui.

00:13:25.644 --> 00:13:26.940
Your dad is here. He's downstairs.

00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:28.311
He wants you to go down quickly.

00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:28.980
Wait...

00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:37.700
Let's go.

00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:41.133
Oh, no...

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:42.700
Cheng Rui!

00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:44.180
You useless kid!

00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:44.940
This...

00:13:44.977 --> 00:13:45.940
Are you satisfied now?

00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:48.220
This...

00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:49.060
Let's go.

00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:33.620
Hey, Li Wu.

00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:35.020
Finished your exams?

00:14:36.711 --> 00:14:38.533
I'm going to school to pick you up now.

00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:39.888
Wait for me at the school gate.

00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:42.420
Okay.

00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:05.060
Why so quiet?

00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:06.620
How was the exam?

00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:13.060
It was okay.

00:15:23.111 --> 00:15:24.377
Are you feeling unwell?

00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:28.260
Li Wu?

00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:35.260
No.

00:15:46.844 --> 00:15:47.780
I ordered takeout.

00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:48.844
Go read your book.

00:15:49.020 --> 00:15:49.911
I'm not hungry.

00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:51.700
You tell me.

00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:54.100
Did I upset you today?

00:15:57.866 --> 00:15:59.044
Speak.

00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:11.380
Did you tell Mr. Qi

00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:12.340
to change my dorm?

00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:14.580
Yes.

00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:16.060
Why?

00:16:27.688 --> 00:16:29.540
Is there a problem with me
changing your dorm?

00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:39.620
Why couldn't you just tell me?

00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:42.580
I took the fall voluntarily.

00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:43.733
It wasn't them forcing me.

00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:44.820
You did it willingly?

00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:46.580
Can breaking the rules

00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:47.500
ever be voluntary?

00:16:47.577 --> 00:16:48.980
And now you've learned to lie.

00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:50.100
Li Wu,

00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:51.780
you weren't like this before.

00:16:51.955 --> 00:16:53.540
You've been here less than a semester,

00:16:53.688 --> 00:16:54.820
and you've changed so much.

00:16:55.340 --> 00:16:56.140
Tell me.

00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:57.377
You weren't influenced by them?

00:16:57.700 --> 00:16:58.820
They didn't influence me.

00:16:58.820 --> 00:16:59.940
They are my friends.

00:17:00.340 --> 00:17:01.820
What kind of messy friends are those?

00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:03.580
They'll only affect your studies.

00:17:11.222 --> 00:17:12.500
Weren't you the one who told me

00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:13.540
to make friends and fit in?

00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:39.420
So you just ran away from home?

00:17:39.888 --> 00:17:42.060
Just thinking about being
with him in the same room

00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:43.260
makes me angry.

00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:46.340
Then why didn't you kick him out?

00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:48.540
You're the homeowner, right?

00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:50.300
How could I?

00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:51.740
He has no family.

00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:52.666
Where could he go?

00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:56.180
You're all talk but soft-hearted.

00:17:57.644 --> 00:17:59.060
Alright, stop mentioning him.

00:17:59.111 --> 00:18:00.666
Talking about him gives me a headache.

00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:02.266
I'm thirsty. I want water.

00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:05.820
What water?

00:18:06.220 --> 00:18:06.820
This one.

00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:09.460
Fine.

00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:15.940
You just came out like this.

00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:18.460
What if your brother looks for you?

00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:20.420
He won't look for me.

00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:25.500
(Brother)

00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:26.140
He called.

00:18:27.644 --> 00:18:28.380
Don't answer.

00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:32.822
Really not answering?

00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:35.100
Your brother's been worrying about you.

00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:36.100
Can't focus.

00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:37.420
What about his studies?

00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:39.580
Just like I told you,

00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:41.020
wouldn't you be mad?

00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:42.180
I'm not mad.

00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:44.444
Whatever the handsome guy says,

00:18:44.488 --> 00:18:45.377
I won't be mad.

00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:53.180
(Brother)

00:18:55.940 --> 00:18:56.380
Answer?

00:18:58.180 --> 00:18:58.700
Ignore him.

00:18:59.100 --> 00:18:59.660
Don't answer.

00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:19.100
(Brother)

00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:21.140
So persistent.

00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:23.500
If he likes, let him call.

00:19:35.222 --> 00:19:36.500
(Brother)
He really has perseverance.

00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:39.260
Have you noticed?

00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:41.500
Every call

00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:42.660
is one minute apart.

00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:44.580
Does he have OCD?

00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:01.540
This is your old phone.

00:20:04.577 --> 00:20:05.660
I gave it to Li Wu.

00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:08.980
He isn't stupid.

00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:10.660
He knew to call your friend.

00:20:13.540 --> 00:20:14.060
Answer?

00:20:46.866 --> 00:20:48.511
(Chun Chang: Cen Jin's here with me.)

00:20:48.511 --> 00:20:49.355
(Don't worry.)

00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:50.540
(Go rest early.)

00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:52.133
(She's going back tomorrow.)

00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:03.540
(I will study hard,)

00:23:04.177 --> 00:23:05.733
(and won't let you worry again.)

00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:12.420
Study hard?

00:23:12.488 --> 00:23:13.860
I'll see how well you can study

00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:14.780
to what extent.

00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:29.100
Move forward.

00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:29.700
Hurry.

00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:31.260
Go forward.

00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:39.780
That way.

00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:43.460
Stand properly.

00:23:46.420 --> 00:23:47.300
Don't bump into me.

00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:48.060
Why bump into me?

00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:48.900
Who bumped into you?

00:23:51.044 --> 00:23:52.140
Why are you shouting?

00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:53.380
Don't crowd here.

00:23:53.860 --> 00:23:54.420
Still noisy?

00:23:54.733 --> 00:23:55.900
The class bell rang ages ago!

00:23:55.900 --> 00:23:56.660
Didn't you hear?

00:23:58.900 --> 00:23:59.500
How's your line

00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:00.100
organized?

00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:02.140
Stand properly!

00:24:04.422 --> 00:24:05.733
The four boys in the back.

00:24:06.540 --> 00:24:07.620
Could you work a bit,

00:24:07.911 --> 00:24:09.222
go to the equipment room

00:24:09.266 --> 00:24:10.844
and bring out the volleyballs?

00:24:15.533 --> 00:24:17.244
One meter apart. Left and right.

00:24:17.444 --> 00:24:18.733
Stand properly, and line up.

00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:20.820
Align front and back.

00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:23.500
Come.

00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:25.380
Joint warm-up, ready, go!

00:24:25.660 --> 00:24:27.700
One, two, three, four.

00:24:47.260 --> 00:24:48.180
Sorry about that.

00:24:48.660 --> 00:24:49.340
My hand slipped.

00:24:52.060 --> 00:24:53.100
You're way off.

00:24:53.220 --> 00:24:53.780
Watch me.

00:24:58.140 --> 00:24:59.540
The volleyball doesn't feel right.

00:24:59.860 --> 00:25:01.980
Next time, we'll just use a basketball.

00:25:04.180 --> 00:25:05.140
With your build,

00:25:05.177 --> 00:25:06.260
you should use a shot put.

00:25:06.460 --> 00:25:08.060
First time finding volleyball

00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:08.900
so fun, right?

00:25:09.060 --> 00:25:10.266
There's even more fun to come.

00:25:18.511 --> 00:25:20.000
What are you trying to do?

00:25:22.780 --> 00:25:23.540
What's the problem?

00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:26.620
Want to fight?

00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:29.155
What are you guys doing?

00:25:30.860 --> 00:25:32.220
Rocket Class's Tao Wanwen.

00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:33.620
Mr. Qi's proud disciple.

00:25:33.620 --> 00:25:34.180
Let's go.

00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:50.660
Wipe your hands.

00:25:52.860 --> 00:25:53.380
No need.

00:25:59.140 --> 00:25:59.860
You are...

00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:01.420
You know Cheng Rui, right?

00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:04.140
You're ostracized

00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:05.700
because of me.

00:26:06.260 --> 00:26:07.220
But don't worry,

00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:09.100
I'll figure out a way to help you.

00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:12.620
No need.

00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:13.500
Thanks.

00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:23.020
This was a special case.

00:26:23.020 --> 00:26:24.100
I won't ask for leave again.

00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:26.220
Indeed, no more leave.

00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:28.177
Monthly exams are coming soon.

00:26:28.222 --> 00:26:29.300
You need to focus,

00:26:29.420 --> 00:26:30.180
no distractions.

00:26:30.820 --> 00:26:31.700
Okay, don't worry.

00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:33.340
I'll work twice as hard for the exams.

00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:35.220
Go back to class.

00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:35.700
Okay.

00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:36.500
Bye, Mr. Qi.

00:26:36.660 --> 00:26:37.180
Bye.

00:26:42.780 --> 00:26:43.380
Wen.

00:26:44.540 --> 00:26:45.180
Come with me.

00:26:46.460 --> 00:26:47.260
Where to?

00:26:53.511 --> 00:26:54.888
About you not coming home at night,

00:26:54.955 --> 00:26:57.511
why didn't you explain it clearly
to your dad and Mr. Qi?

00:26:57.533 --> 00:26:59.066
That's your personal matter.

00:26:59.111 --> 00:27:01.333
I shouldn't tell others.

00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:03.220
Alright, I got it.

00:27:04.140 --> 00:27:05.460
I also explained to the teacher.

00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:08.060
What are you doing?

00:27:08.577 --> 00:27:10.555
If so, I was getting scolded
for nothing.

00:27:10.933 --> 00:27:12.740
Who told you to act on your own that day

00:27:12.740 --> 00:27:13.420
and help me?

00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:16.780
How's your college application going?

00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:18.660
No way.

00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:20.820
My parents gathered

00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:21.820
relatives and friends

00:27:21.820 --> 00:27:23.860
at home every day.
Brainwashing me in shifts.

00:27:24.540 --> 00:27:25.940
If Mr. Qi hadn't called

00:27:25.940 --> 00:27:27.340
to tell them if I didn't come back,

00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:28.580
it would affect my NCEE,

00:27:28.866 --> 00:27:30.311
I couldn't even come back.

00:27:34.020 --> 00:27:34.780
Then...

00:27:35.755 --> 00:27:36.780
Don't worry about it.

00:27:36.888 --> 00:27:37.980
I'll figure it out myself.

00:27:39.260 --> 00:27:40.380
Alright.

00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:42.580
Stop frowning.

00:27:43.460 --> 00:27:44.300
Day after day,

00:27:44.620 --> 00:27:45.740
it's upsetting to watch.

00:27:46.660 --> 00:27:47.780
You're not upset?

00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:49.780
You're becoming a bully.

00:27:54.980 --> 00:27:55.900
How did you know?

00:27:57.940 --> 00:27:59.220
I didn't bully him.

00:27:59.780 --> 00:28:01.060
I just wanted to vent.

00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:05.700
He was obviously hypocritical.

00:28:06.260 --> 00:28:06.660
Yes.

00:28:06.733 --> 00:28:08.060
Later, it got a bit out of hand.

00:28:08.266 --> 00:28:09.822
But Fatty Zhang and the others

00:28:09.844 --> 00:28:10.822
also defended me.

00:28:10.900 --> 00:28:11.820
At this moment,

00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:13.200
I can't stand up and blame them.

00:28:13.266 --> 00:28:14.660
That would be ungrateful.

00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:17.340
What do you mean by ungrateful?

00:28:17.620 --> 00:28:18.860
Fatty Zhang

00:28:18.860 --> 00:28:19.780
is defending you

00:28:19.900 --> 00:28:21.100
or venting his own anger?

00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:22.020
Can you tell?

00:28:22.822 --> 00:28:24.044
Li Wu took the fall for you,

00:28:24.066 --> 00:28:25.900
and didn't tell the teacher
about your matter.

00:28:25.900 --> 00:28:27.355
What more do you want from him?

00:28:27.422 --> 00:28:28.740
He didn't tell the teacher,

00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:30.420
but he told his parents.

00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:31.780
Isn't that the same thing?

00:28:31.900 --> 00:28:32.660
Not the same.

00:28:32.660 --> 00:28:33.580
He has no parents.

00:28:35.620 --> 00:28:36.700
He has no parents?

00:28:37.780 --> 00:28:39.100
Li Wu's parents and grandfather

00:28:39.100 --> 00:28:40.133
have all passed away.

00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:42.140
He told his sister about your matter,

00:28:42.140 --> 00:28:43.340
but she's not his real sister.

00:28:43.355 --> 00:28:45.000
She's the daughter of his benefactor.

00:28:45.022 --> 00:28:47.466
That kind of relationship,
how could you expect him to lie?

00:28:50.540 --> 00:28:52.220
Who did you hear this from?

00:28:53.020 --> 00:28:53.780
Thanks to you,

00:28:53.900 --> 00:28:55.260
Mr. Qi just told me.

00:28:57.460 --> 00:28:58.620
I didn't know.

00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:01.020
Now you know.

00:29:01.020 --> 00:29:01.980
Can you stop now?

00:29:03.100 --> 00:29:04.060
Fatty Zhang

00:29:04.060 --> 00:29:05.580
is bullying Li Wu

00:29:05.580 --> 00:29:07.066
under the guise of defending you.

00:29:07.220 --> 00:29:08.020
If the teacher asks,

00:29:08.020 --> 00:29:09.260
he'll just say you led it.

00:29:09.420 --> 00:29:10.780
He won't lose at all.

00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:12.900
You're like a fool,

00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:13.980
being used as a pawn.

00:29:16.860 --> 00:29:18.660
I didn't intend to make such a big deal.

00:29:20.780 --> 00:29:21.820
Then what should I do now?

00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:23.180
Go apologize to Li Wu.

00:29:24.060 --> 00:29:24.820
Apologize?

00:29:25.220 --> 00:29:26.300
No way...

00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:27.660
That's too embarrassing.

00:29:29.060 --> 00:29:29.420
Fine.

00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:30.900
Then go make friends with your pride.

00:29:31.180 --> 00:29:32.100
Big ego.

00:29:35.420 --> 00:29:36.180
Wait for me.

00:29:36.340 --> 00:29:37.340
Help me think.

00:29:37.340 --> 00:29:37.820
Is there

00:29:37.820 --> 00:29:39.180
a more tactful way?

00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:42.740
Bye, Jin.

00:29:43.260 --> 00:29:43.780
Bye.

00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:46.980
Cen Jin.

00:29:58.300 --> 00:29:58.620
Sit.

00:30:04.060 --> 00:30:04.580
How is it?

00:30:04.580 --> 00:30:06.155
After working at the company
for a while,

00:30:06.180 --> 00:30:07.177
are you used to it?

00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:08.260
Pretty good.

00:30:08.820 --> 00:30:09.860
Pretty good?

00:30:10.244 --> 00:30:11.740
You jumped straight into the work,

00:30:11.755 --> 00:30:13.000
and you must be exhausted.

00:30:14.260 --> 00:30:15.060
Free on Friday?

00:30:15.288 --> 00:30:16.180
If you don't mind,

00:30:16.266 --> 00:30:17.540
let's have a welcome dinner.

00:30:20.220 --> 00:30:21.100
Friday, huh?

00:30:22.580 --> 00:30:22.980
Why?

00:30:23.660 --> 00:30:24.420
Any other plans?

00:30:26.060 --> 00:30:26.540
No.

00:30:27.540 --> 00:30:28.740
Don't mind if I pay?

00:30:29.620 --> 00:30:32.460
Well, I really care about this.

00:30:33.020 --> 00:30:34.220
Let me take this chance.

00:30:36.900 --> 00:30:37.580
Thanks, boss.

00:30:38.140 --> 00:30:38.980
But...

00:30:41.580 --> 00:30:43.180
This meal isn't just for free.

00:30:45.022 --> 00:30:46.844
Are you familiar with Bei'ao Motors?

00:30:47.900 --> 00:30:49.100
I've worked with them before.

00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:51.300
They're launching a new model.

00:30:51.940 --> 00:30:53.100
Many ad companies

00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:53.740
are competing.

00:30:55.020 --> 00:30:56.020
I want you to try.

00:30:56.220 --> 00:30:56.820
Can you do it?

00:30:58.540 --> 00:30:59.940
Yes. I have contacts.

00:31:00.100 --> 00:31:00.900
I'll reach out.

00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:01.660
Okay.

00:31:01.777 --> 00:31:02.977
I'll send you the materials.

00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:03.820
Any questions,

00:31:04.177 --> 00:31:05.020
contact me anytime.

00:31:05.460 --> 00:31:05.900
Okay.

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:06.620
Thanks, boss.

00:31:07.180 --> 00:31:07.820
Class dismissed.

00:31:07.820 --> 00:31:08.260
Rise.

00:31:09.180 --> 00:31:12.020
- Bye, teacher.
- Bye, teacher.

00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:13.660
Bye, students.

00:31:23.620 --> 00:31:24.100
Let's go.

00:31:26.580 --> 00:31:27.100
Okay.

00:31:30.940 --> 00:31:31.980
Should we

00:31:31.980 --> 00:31:33.420
go to the library tomorrow to study?

00:31:33.755 --> 00:31:34.900
I don't want to stay home.

00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:36.260
My parents are too naggy.

00:31:37.420 --> 00:31:38.260
Give me a break.

00:31:38.260 --> 00:31:38.980
It's the weekend.

00:31:39.380 --> 00:31:41.060
I just want to go home and sleep.

00:32:50.420 --> 00:32:50.860
Here.

00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:51.940
Give me the bag.

00:32:52.244 --> 00:32:52.900
Get in the car.

00:32:56.620 --> 00:33:06.500
(Yi City Yingcai High School)

00:33:20.380 --> 00:33:20.860
Hello.

00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:27.620
(Friday, picking up Li Wu from school.)

00:33:37.540 --> 00:33:38.100
Jin.

00:33:38.540 --> 00:33:39.060
You're here.

00:33:39.220 --> 00:33:39.620
This way.

00:33:39.940 --> 00:33:40.380
Let's go.

00:33:40.911 --> 00:33:42.180
Everyone's waiting for you.

00:33:44.620 --> 00:33:45.500
Jin is here.

00:33:48.340 --> 00:33:48.940
You're late.

00:33:49.380 --> 00:33:50.460
Sorry, I'm late.

00:33:51.100 --> 00:33:52.180
Jin, you look so pretty.

00:33:52.340 --> 00:33:52.740
Jin.

00:33:52.980 --> 00:33:53.500
Thank you.

00:33:53.620 --> 00:34:00.500
(Yi City Yingcai High School)

00:34:28.660 --> 00:34:30.060
Hey, waiting for someone?

00:34:30.060 --> 00:34:30.940
We're closing.

00:34:37.020 --> 00:34:38.340
Hey, what's wrong?

00:34:38.820 --> 00:34:39.660
We're closing.

00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:43.660
Sorry.

00:34:55.740 --> 00:34:56.660
Manager, your tea.

00:34:56.660 --> 00:34:57.340
Okay, thanks.

00:34:58.140 --> 00:34:58.820
Here, Miss.

00:34:58.820 --> 00:34:59.340
Your tea.

00:35:00.300 --> 00:35:00.780
Thanks.

00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:03.060
A few days ago,

00:35:03.060 --> 00:35:04.620
I ran into Mr. Wu and found out

00:35:04.666 --> 00:35:06.222
you had left Yiwen Creative Dream.

00:35:06.380 --> 00:35:06.740
Yes.

00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:08.020
I'm at AusStar now.

00:35:08.220 --> 00:35:08.980
AusStar?

00:35:09.777 --> 00:35:10.740
I'm not very familiar.

00:35:10.777 --> 00:35:12.111
What projects have you done?

00:35:12.111 --> 00:35:13.340
Our company is relatively new,

00:35:13.620 --> 00:35:14.620
but we've already worked

00:35:14.620 --> 00:35:16.222
with quite a few well-known brands.

00:35:16.533 --> 00:35:17.540
Our business capability

00:35:17.700 --> 00:35:19.340
has a good reputation in the industry.

00:35:20.380 --> 00:35:21.620
The team is young,

00:35:21.620 --> 00:35:23.180
but full of energy

00:35:23.180 --> 00:35:24.380
and a spirit of exploration.

00:35:24.580 --> 00:35:24.980
Of course.

00:35:25.460 --> 00:35:26.500
I trust your judgment.

00:35:26.777 --> 00:35:28.820
And also trust the company
you chose to develop with

00:35:28.820 --> 00:35:29.580
won't be bad.

00:35:30.780 --> 00:35:32.580
But since you came to me,

00:35:32.777 --> 00:35:34.133
I won't hide it from you.

00:35:34.540 --> 00:35:35.460
Bei'ao Motors

00:35:35.511 --> 00:35:37.500
only chooses companies
from its supplier pool

00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:38.620
to cooperate with.

00:35:39.460 --> 00:35:40.580
AusStar isn't in it.

00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:43.020
And now competing

00:35:43.020 --> 00:35:43.780
for this project

00:35:44.380 --> 00:35:46.700
are Yiwen Creative Dream
and several other

00:35:46.820 --> 00:35:48.266
top companies in the industry.

00:35:48.355 --> 00:35:50.377
With your company's current strength,

00:35:51.060 --> 00:35:53.300
I guess even passing
the qualification review

00:35:53.660 --> 00:35:54.460
will be hard.

00:35:54.820 --> 00:35:56.460
AusStar wasn't

00:35:56.620 --> 00:35:58.180
in Bei'ao Motors's supplier pool,

00:35:58.620 --> 00:35:59.980
which is indeed our mistake.

00:36:01.540 --> 00:36:02.660
But we're ready

00:36:02.660 --> 00:36:03.820
to do our best to compete.

00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:05.620
The application materials

00:36:05.780 --> 00:36:07.140
were submitted this morning.

00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:08.540
It meets Bei'ao Motors's

00:36:08.540 --> 00:36:09.100
requirements.

00:36:10.155 --> 00:36:12.044
Yiwen Creative Dream
is, of course, excellent,

00:36:12.180 --> 00:36:14.100
but AusStar has its own advantages.

00:36:14.460 --> 00:36:15.540
Our creativity,

00:36:15.700 --> 00:36:16.340
execution,

00:36:16.780 --> 00:36:17.900
and cost-effectiveness

00:36:18.260 --> 00:36:20.340
are the best among these companies.

00:36:22.140 --> 00:36:23.060
These are

00:36:23.300 --> 00:36:24.940
some project materials from our company.

00:36:24.940 --> 00:36:25.740
You can take a look.

00:36:25.740 --> 00:36:26.180
Okay.

00:36:30.620 --> 00:36:31.260
If we

00:36:31.260 --> 00:36:32.540
can take on this project,

00:36:32.860 --> 00:36:35.340
AusStar will gain more recognition
in the industry.

00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:36.900
You can also get

00:36:36.900 --> 00:36:37.820
a good project

00:36:37.844 --> 00:36:39.688
with extremely high cost-effectiveness.

00:36:40.260 --> 00:36:41.340
So I hope Mr. Chen

00:36:41.660 --> 00:36:42.620
will consider,

00:36:42.780 --> 00:36:43.420
giving us

00:36:43.420 --> 00:36:44.420
a chance to pitch.

00:36:44.700 --> 00:36:45.340
As planned,

00:36:45.422 --> 00:36:47.400
our new product launches next month.

00:36:47.466 --> 00:36:49.460
We must finalize the marketing team.

00:36:50.180 --> 00:36:52.220
So, the time for you
to prepare your proposal

00:36:52.933 --> 00:36:54.244
is probably only two weeks.

00:36:54.311 --> 00:36:55.066
Can you manage?

00:36:55.620 --> 00:36:56.380
Two weeks is fine.

00:36:56.780 --> 00:36:57.140
Okay.

00:36:58.140 --> 00:36:59.820
Then, quickly complete the follow-up

00:36:59.820 --> 00:37:01.620
supplier approval documents.

00:37:01.780 --> 00:37:02.740
I'll give you

00:37:02.740 --> 00:37:04.355
a chance to participate in the pitch.

00:37:04.940 --> 00:37:05.500
Of course.

00:37:05.940 --> 00:37:07.020
Who gets chosen in the end

00:37:07.020 --> 00:37:08.300
will still depend on strength.

00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:10.940
Thanks, Mr. Chen.

00:37:11.380 --> 00:37:14.220
(Bei'ao Motors)

00:37:19.020 --> 00:37:20.260
Hello, are you Li Wu's parent?

00:37:25.780 --> 00:37:29.980
(Clinic)

00:37:29.980 --> 00:37:31.260
Hello, are you Li Wu's parent?

00:37:31.620 --> 00:37:32.020
Yes.

00:37:32.420 --> 00:37:33.140
How is he?

00:37:33.420 --> 00:37:33.900
Fever.

00:37:34.044 --> 00:37:34.900
Thirty-nine degrees.

00:37:35.180 --> 00:37:36.140
He's been unwell

00:37:36.140 --> 00:37:37.420
for a couple of days.

00:37:37.900 --> 00:37:38.940
Medication didn't help.

00:37:39.220 --> 00:37:41.155
Better take him
to the hospital for IV fluids.

00:37:41.500 --> 00:37:41.900
Okay.

00:37:42.100 --> 00:37:42.700
Thanks.

00:37:42.820 --> 00:37:43.980
You're welcome. It's my duty.

00:37:51.740 --> 00:37:54.460
(Treatment Room)

00:37:55.980 --> 00:37:56.420
Let's go.

00:38:06.933 --> 00:38:08.555
Just grabbed this from your dorm.

00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:10.420
Put it on and come with me
to see the doctor.

00:38:39.100 --> 00:38:40.900
Sorry, everyone's in line.

00:38:48.555 --> 00:38:49.740
Why are you cutting in line?

00:38:49.740 --> 00:38:50.555
Go to the back.

00:38:51.100 --> 00:38:51.580
Line up.

00:38:52.100 --> 00:38:52.500
Just go.

00:38:59.133 --> 00:39:00.177
What are you doing?

00:39:01.940 --> 00:39:02.420
I...

00:39:03.340 --> 00:39:04.420
was afraid he'd bully you.

00:39:05.580 --> 00:39:06.340
Better now?

00:39:07.940 --> 00:39:08.500
Sit back.

00:39:35.500 --> 00:39:36.180
Hey, Ted.

00:39:36.300 --> 00:39:37.700
Sorry. I'm in a bit of a hurry.

00:39:37.820 --> 00:39:39.111
Can I request half a day off?

00:39:39.866 --> 00:39:41.140
My younger brother is sick.

00:39:41.140 --> 00:39:42.822
I'm accompanying him in the hospital.

00:39:44.380 --> 00:39:44.940
Thanks.

00:40:00.060 --> 00:40:00.860
Haven't you

00:40:00.860 --> 00:40:01.820
eaten anything today?

00:40:05.488 --> 00:40:06.666
Haven't eaten, right?

00:40:07.620 --> 00:40:08.260
I...

00:40:08.900 --> 00:40:10.340
don't really feel like eating.

00:40:13.711 --> 00:40:15.266
I'll go buy something to eat.

00:40:23.580 --> 00:40:25.700
(Sodium Chloride Injection)

00:40:50.580 --> 00:40:51.540
Okay. Gotta go.

00:41:01.100 --> 00:41:02.180
(Brother)

00:41:02.900 --> 00:41:03.620
(Sorry.)

00:41:13.340 --> 00:41:14.780
(It's okay.)

00:41:16.900 --> 00:41:17.460
Hello.

00:41:18.460 --> 00:41:19.220
Your meal is ready.

00:41:19.580 --> 00:41:19.980
Okay.

00:41:31.820 --> 00:41:32.540
I bought congee,

00:41:32.540 --> 00:41:34.333
shredded chicken noodles and wontons.

00:41:36.100 --> 00:41:36.900
Too much.

00:41:38.020 --> 00:41:39.177
Eat as much as you can.

00:41:39.300 --> 00:41:41.020
Good nutrition helps faster recovery.

00:41:48.780 --> 00:41:49.340
So...

00:41:52.177 --> 00:41:52.660
You....

00:41:53.311 --> 00:41:54.711
Aren't you mad at me anymore?

00:41:57.555 --> 00:42:00.044
I already replied to you
on WeChat, didn't I?

00:42:04.300 --> 00:42:04.940
Eat quickly.

00:42:05.488 --> 00:42:06.380
What do you want?

00:42:06.577 --> 00:42:07.380
I'll just eat this.

00:42:14.220 --> 00:42:14.660
I'll do it.

00:42:21.660 --> 00:42:22.060
Done.

00:42:25.140 --> 00:42:25.580
Here.

00:42:26.420 --> 00:42:26.900
Thanks.

00:42:35.620 --> 00:42:36.140
