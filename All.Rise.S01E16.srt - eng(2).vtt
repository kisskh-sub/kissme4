00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:11.919
I did not expect you could go on the forum and

00:02:11.919 --> 00:02:13.360
find the info about the game leak

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:15.199
Impressive

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:17.520
I told you, I am a veteran gamer

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:20.199
And we have worked together for so long

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:21.159
I know you pretty well too

00:02:21.639 --> 00:02:24.039
You are the type who seizes every chance

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.800
So there is no way you would

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.319
come to my place to game for no reason

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.879
So last night you wanted to see me make a fool of myself

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:31.280
I am not that free

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.240
I also wanted you to relax a bit

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:34.960
Besides

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:36.719
I did not want you to leave

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:42.000
Honestly

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.759
you crammed so much material in such a short time

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:44.719
it is really impressive

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:48.479
Do we really have to compete

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:49.120
Can we not just

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:50.719
work together instead

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.840
Lawyer Song said he will only pick one person

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:56.520
Let us each do our own work

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:59.479
Do not be so ruthless

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:01.719
What, you are faking sick just to avoid working with me

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:06.080
It is fine, my stomach hurts, it will pass soon

00:03:06.919 --> 00:03:07.520
It really hurts

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:12.599
Then I will take you to the hospital

00:03:13.719 --> 00:03:14.039
Come on

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:20.919
Let us go, let us go home

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.080
The doctor said you have acute gastroenteritis

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.680
You need an IV and in hospital observation

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:27.479
I just need to take some medicine

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:28.919
It is an old problem, I know my own body

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.080
If you knew, it would not hurt this much

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.000
Can you care about yourself once in a while

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.520
Ren Jiatong

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:36.240
I cannot drop the ball at a time like this

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.080
You are human, not a machine

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.840
Getting sick is not the same as dropping the ball

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:43.400
You cannot always chase victory

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:44.240
and sacrifice your body every time

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:45.360
Then what is the point of winning

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:47.680
If I do not win, what is the point of me being at Jun'an

00:03:47.719 --> 00:03:48.680
It matters to me

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:52.719
Yesterday you did it for me

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:54.240
to throw me a warm house party

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:55.800
that is why you drank cold beer

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.479
If I had known you had stomach issues

00:03:58.479 --> 00:03:59.919
I would never have let you drink something cold

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:02.080
So just treat this as doing it for me

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:04.039
to ease my guilt

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:05.680
Can we please finish the IV

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:24.600
Is the drip rate too fast

00:04:25.079 --> 00:04:25.920
It looks like you are in pain

00:04:27.279 --> 00:04:27.759
It is fine

00:04:33.319 --> 00:04:34.399
Actually, it is not that you are

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.079
afraid of delaying work, is it

00:04:37.079 --> 00:04:37.680
you are afraid of needles

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:47.360
Dont be scared

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:49.399
I have experience with this

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:52.759
I used to get sick a lot as a kid

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:54.480
Once I had a fever

00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:55.600
A really high fever

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:57.319
My hands were so swollen

00:04:58.079 --> 00:04:58.920
Both my chubby little hands

00:04:59.319 --> 00:05:00.360
They could not even find a vein

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.720
So the nurse said she would stick the needle in my foot

00:05:03.839 --> 00:05:05.439
So my foot got hooked up to the drip

00:05:05.439 --> 00:05:06.199
Lying there in bed

00:05:06.759 --> 00:05:07.720
The younger me just thought

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:09.160
If only my mom and dad

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:10.839
could be by my side with me

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:12.160
But they were both not there

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:14.519
My grandparents were with me though

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.519
Did your parents at least call you

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:18.439
Yeah they did

00:05:19.079 --> 00:05:20.240
My grandparents were really funny

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:21.000
They told me

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:22.040
Big grandson

00:05:22.839 --> 00:05:24.120
When they call you just cry

00:05:25.079 --> 00:05:25.879
Cry your lungs out

00:05:26.519 --> 00:05:27.560
Then they will come and stay with you

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:29.639
But I never cried even once

00:05:29.959 --> 00:05:30.439
Pretty strong huh

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.000
Too strong

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:34.600
But you know

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.680
If I could meet that little kid now

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:37.600
I would definitely tell him

00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:39.800
You were really really brave

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.160
It is okay even if you cry

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:42.839
You do not have to be that sensible

00:05:44.279 --> 00:05:45.199
I was mainly afraid

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:47.680
that even if I did cry

00:05:47.839 --> 00:05:48.720
they still would not come back

00:05:49.279 --> 00:05:50.160
I would be so disappointed

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:55.600
To be honest

00:05:55.959 --> 00:05:58.160
that nurse who put me on the drip

00:05:58.759 --> 00:05:59.480
was super pretty

00:05:59.959 --> 00:06:01.879
I was thinking I am just a

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:03.120
little boy

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:05.079
if I cried in front of a pretty girl

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:06.279
how embarrassing would that be

00:06:08.079 --> 00:06:09.199
Then you are pretty impressive too

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:11.519
I cried all the time when I was little

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:12.560
I was really timid

00:06:13.279 --> 00:06:14.279
Not only scared of needles

00:06:16.079 --> 00:06:17.399
I was also terrified of caterpillars

00:06:18.279 --> 00:06:20.160
Once a caterpillar fell on me

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:21.959
I cried for a whole day

00:06:24.959 --> 00:06:25.439
Is that so

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:29.040
Thanks for telling me your weak spot

00:06:31.519 --> 00:06:32.079
If

00:06:32.839 --> 00:06:34.519
I lose to you in this competition

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:38.600
I will go catch a ton of caterpillars outside

00:06:39.759 --> 00:06:41.120
I will make you feel terrified

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:42.600
You will be worried

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:44.199
that every single day you are at Junan

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:45.279
right next to you

00:06:45.279 --> 00:06:46.839
a caterpillar could appear at any time

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:47.839
You would not dare

00:06:56.839 --> 00:06:57.720
The time it takes to finish a bottle of water

00:06:58.480 --> 00:06:58.879
Dont be scared

00:06:59.519 --> 00:06:59.959
I am here with you

00:07:37.279 --> 00:07:38.720
Tongtong I am heading to work

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:40.160
Get some good rest at home

00:07:40.519 --> 00:07:41.319
Later I will help you

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:43.560
ask Lawyer Zhou in person for another day off ok

00:07:47.959 --> 00:07:49.199
Stop rushing back to work

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:52.040
Take it slow on the way

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:52.920
Stay safe

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.240
When I finish work I will take you to eat something nice

00:08:06.079 --> 00:08:07.399
Forgot something again

00:08:17.519 --> 00:08:18.360
Why have you not left yet

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:20.800
I came to check on you

00:08:20.879 --> 00:08:21.639
How are you feeling

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:23.079
Much better

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:27.079
I sent you a message yesterday

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:28.519
and you did not reply

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:30.399
I did not see it yesterday

00:08:30.519 --> 00:08:31.399
I came back and fell asleep

00:08:31.399 --> 00:08:32.480
And I did not have time this morning either

00:08:41.519 --> 00:08:42.600
Okay I saw it

00:08:43.559 --> 00:08:44.919
I did not know how to reply

00:08:48.399 --> 00:08:49.399
I was afraid you would get the wrong idea

00:08:54.919 --> 00:08:56.320
There is actually nothing to worry about

00:08:58.600 --> 00:08:59.879
I simply like you

00:09:00.799 --> 00:09:01.320
I admit it

00:09:07.399 --> 00:09:08.759
And I know you have feelings for me too

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:22.840
I was just afraid you would overthink it

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:24.200
So I wanted to make things clear to you

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:24.639
I mean

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:27.080
I understand your concerns

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:29.159
Jun'an is against office romances

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:31.759
Honestly, I also hesitated about it

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:34.159
Plus, because of your family situation

00:09:34.159 --> 00:09:36.200
maybe you do not really trust relationships

00:09:36.399 --> 00:09:38.240
But my family is just as complicated

00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:41.879
And you were right about me too

00:09:41.879 --> 00:09:43.960
I really do not have much experience in love

00:09:44.399 --> 00:09:46.080
So I cannot guarantee that

00:09:46.159 --> 00:09:47.440
I can handle a relationship well

00:09:49.039 --> 00:09:51.480
But I hope at least you will not

00:09:51.919 --> 00:09:52.919
turn down my feelings for you

00:09:54.559 --> 00:09:55.320
or avoid me

00:09:58.720 --> 00:09:59.039
I

00:10:00.679 --> 00:10:01.919
I will know where to draw the line

00:10:01.919 --> 00:10:04.000
I am not the kind of person who makes you awkward

00:10:06.639 --> 00:10:08.759
You are a very respectable rival to me

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:10.960
I believe in the future

00:10:11.919 --> 00:10:14.679
we will at least be very unusual friends

00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:36.519
Where is my charging cable

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:39.639
I just have feelings for you

00:10:40.039 --> 00:10:40.679
I admit it

00:10:42.879 --> 00:10:44.000
I know you have feelings for me too

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:48.679
I promise you

00:10:48.799 --> 00:10:50.000
there is really nothing going on between us

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:51.639
That is for the best

00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:54.480
If you two really get together

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:57.720
you have to tell me

00:10:58.519 --> 00:10:59.240
I will give you advice

00:11:05.879 --> 00:11:07.159
Why is nobody here today

00:11:09.639 --> 00:11:10.960
Tongtong is resting at home

00:11:11.639 --> 00:11:14.360
Jiang Chen and Li Ke both went out to look into

00:11:14.879 --> 00:11:17.399
the new company the creative director joined

00:11:19.159 --> 00:11:21.039
Right now I am the only one with no ideas

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:24.240
It is fine I do not have any ideas either

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:27.039
Feifei

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:30.399
If you date someone in Jun'an

00:11:31.759 --> 00:11:32.919
does one of you really have to leave

00:11:37.159 --> 00:11:38.399
I thought you were worrying about the plan

00:11:38.399 --> 00:11:39.600
but you are worrying about this

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:40.879
Who have you fallen for

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:42.399
No

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:44.120
Whoever you like

00:11:44.919 --> 00:11:46.519
if you really start dating

00:11:46.519 --> 00:11:48.279
you are not allowed to tell anyone got it

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:50.759
If someone with bad intentions hears it

00:11:50.759 --> 00:11:51.240
what will you do

00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:52.600
Besides

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.159
only people whose brains are broken

00:11:54.159 --> 00:11:55.519
would fall for male lawyers

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.559
I am not saying all male lawyers are bad

00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:05.519
but why do you have to pick a colleague

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.600
You just escaped a tiger's mouth

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:08.519
and now you want to enter a wolf den

00:12:10.919 --> 00:12:12.080
With ulterior motives

00:12:19.759 --> 00:12:20.879
What is wrong with you Little Raindrop

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:24.120
It is just

00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:26.399
there is someone I really trust

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.360
who does not really seem to trust me

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:30.679
Then that is not your problem

00:12:31.759 --> 00:12:34.639
Maybe that person was betrayed before

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:36.840
hurt and lied to

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:38.320
so they learned their lesson

00:12:38.879 --> 00:12:40.639
and know that the people who know you best

00:12:40.759 --> 00:12:42.879
know best how to stab you where it hurts

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:44.879
It is like a Non-Compete Agreement

00:12:45.879 --> 00:12:47.639
Back when they started the business and got along

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:48.519
they did not sign anything

00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:51.120
Now there is trouble and they want to fix it

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:52.519
It is not that easy

00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:56.279
That makes sense

00:12:57.039 --> 00:12:58.480
I think I have found a way to solve it

00:12:59.279 --> 00:13:00.600
Thank you Feifei

00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:22.759
Hello hello

00:13:23.159 --> 00:13:23.720
Hello

00:13:23.759 --> 00:13:24.240
Um

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:26.000
I am a fan of yours

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:28.279
And the games you made before

00:13:28.279 --> 00:13:29.159
I really like them

00:13:29.879 --> 00:13:30.759
These flowers are for you

00:13:30.759 --> 00:13:32.039
No need no need I am allergic to pollen

00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:32.639
Thanks

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:33.120
Th then um

00:13:33.279 --> 00:13:33.799
Could you sign your name for me

00:13:33.799 --> 00:13:34.399
Then I will get going first

00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:35.000
Li Ke

00:13:35.759 --> 00:13:37.000
You as Agent forty seven

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.120
are really playing it with no creativity

00:13:38.879 --> 00:13:40.039
Black suit red tie

00:13:40.039 --> 00:13:40.759
Where is your bald head

00:13:42.039 --> 00:13:43.919
If I work overtime two more days my bald head

00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:47.879
No so sorry

00:14:16.399 --> 00:14:17.039
We started from

00:14:17.039 --> 00:14:19.240
this creative director's social media account

00:14:19.279 --> 00:14:20.120
and found that every year

00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:21.600
he has the habit of going to this expo

00:14:21.879 --> 00:14:23.720
We also discovered a piece of merch he

00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:25.159
really loves of an anime style character

00:14:25.159 --> 00:14:26.399
which Jiang Chen just happened to own

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:29.919
So we pretended to bump into him there

00:14:29.919 --> 00:14:30.879
to get his attention

00:14:30.919 --> 00:14:32.600
and said we could sell him this merch

00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:38.759
It really was parting with it reluctantly

00:14:39.879 --> 00:14:40.519
As luck would have it

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:41.639
this creative director

00:14:41.639 --> 00:14:42.360
left an address

00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:43.879
which turned out to be his new company

00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:45.639
and it shows he signed for it himself

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:46.519
Naturally

00:14:46.919 --> 00:14:48.879
Li Ke and I shot him receiving the courier

00:14:48.919 --> 00:14:50.519
and photos of him returning to the building

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:52.399
Right. Based on this address

00:14:52.399 --> 00:14:53.159
we can basically confirm

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:54.639
he joined Rui E Company

00:14:55.519 --> 00:14:57.279
This is the creative director's car

00:14:57.279 --> 00:14:58.840
entering and leaving the parking lot

00:14:58.840 --> 00:14:59.919
of their company's office park

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:01.759
I went through all the interviews

00:15:01.759 --> 00:15:02.879
with their founding team

00:15:03.279 --> 00:15:03.879
and found that they

00:15:03.879 --> 00:15:05.919
split up not just over business interests

00:15:06.039 --> 00:15:07.879
but because as the company developed

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.399
their ideas and values changed

00:15:09.879 --> 00:15:10.639
That creative director

00:15:10.639 --> 00:15:12.279
still sticks to his original intention

00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:12.879
But

00:15:13.159 --> 00:15:13.639
the Chief Executive Officer

00:15:13.639 --> 00:15:15.600
changed his mind as the business evolved

00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:17.879
So the reason the creative director left

00:15:17.879 --> 00:15:19.240
I guess is very likely because

00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:21.000
he wanted to go to a stronger company

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:23.120
to realize what they once wanted to do

00:15:23.639 --> 00:15:25.639
Among the top game companies now

00:15:25.639 --> 00:15:27.519
the ones that could meet his ideas

00:15:27.639 --> 00:15:28.399
most likely include

00:15:28.399 --> 00:15:29.639
the deep pocketed Rui E Company

00:15:30.279 --> 00:15:31.639
One of our group employees' cars

00:15:31.639 --> 00:15:33.360
just happens to park in this lot

00:15:33.399 --> 00:15:35.480
So I asked him to pull the footage for us

00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:46.879
Nicely done

00:15:49.519 --> 00:15:49.840
Lawyer Zhou

00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:52.360
Should we get in touch with Rui E's

00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:53.320
legal department now

00:15:56.559 --> 00:15:57.399
Dinner gathering tonight

00:15:58.480 --> 00:15:58.919
my treat

00:16:09.399 --> 00:16:09.919
Xiaoyu

00:16:10.639 --> 00:16:11.840
you forgot your charging cable this morning

00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:12.639
I brought it over for you

00:16:15.559 --> 00:16:16.120
Thanks

00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:25.360
What is it with you

00:16:25.879 --> 00:16:26.480
Bad mood

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:32.159
Did you not say you would rest at home

00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:36.159
Yeah I said I would not go

00:16:36.519 --> 00:16:37.360
but they would not take no

00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:38.480
and insisted I come along

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.840
It was her idea after all so

00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:42.759
this sick leave is like no leave at all

00:17:11.359 --> 00:17:13.039
Why did you leave without waiting for me

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:14.119
I was looking for you forever

00:17:29.119 --> 00:17:30.559
Did you not notice I was mad

00:17:38.119 --> 00:17:39.000
What

00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:43.480
Yikousu cookies

00:17:44.119 --> 00:17:44.720
For me

00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:50.519
I went to buy them after work today

00:17:51.279 --> 00:17:52.559
I remember you said before

00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:54.240
these always put you in a great mood

00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:57.799
But were you not just with Jiang Chen

00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:00.079
Me and Jiang Chen

00:18:03.839 --> 00:18:04.319
Tongtong

00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:06.240
you do not really have many friends do you

00:18:09.759 --> 00:18:10.599
My experience making friends

00:18:10.599 --> 00:18:12.240
does pretty much stop before eighteen

00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:14.240
My family went through changes

00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:15.559
and I barely kept in touch with them

00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:17.079
So I really am not good at it

00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:19.480
How about you teach me

00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:24.599
Then listen carefully

00:18:25.359 --> 00:18:26.960
our rule for making friends is

00:18:27.559 --> 00:18:28.599
if I tell you a secret

00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:30.079
then you have to tell me a secret too

00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:32.880
For example

00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:34.440
if

00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:36.440
I am in a relationship now

00:18:36.799 --> 00:18:37.839
I have someone I like

00:18:38.279 --> 00:18:39.799
Then I will tell you right away

00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:40.839
What about you

00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:42.880
Me

00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:46.680
You already know

00:18:47.519 --> 00:18:49.200
But what I want to say is

00:18:49.799 --> 00:18:51.240
We are not together either

00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:52.559
We are just

00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:57.880
I did not tell you

00:18:57.960 --> 00:18:59.079
Not because I was guarding against you

00:18:59.319 --> 00:18:59.839
But because

00:18:59.839 --> 00:19:01.680
I myself have not figured this out yet

00:19:02.519 --> 00:19:04.680
I know you must feel really mixed up now

00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:06.319
Because the situation between you two now

00:19:06.319 --> 00:19:08.480
is just like Lawyer Bai and Lawyer Song back then

00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:10.599
But what I want to tell you is

00:19:11.319 --> 00:19:12.559
I am mad that you did not tell me

00:19:12.839 --> 00:19:14.119
Not that I think you are shutting me out

00:19:14.559 --> 00:19:16.279
It is that you bury everything in your heart

00:19:16.279 --> 00:19:17.079
and that is too hard on you

00:19:18.119 --> 00:19:19.519
If you never talk about your troubles

00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:20.599
what do you even need friends for

00:19:28.279 --> 00:19:28.759
Remember this

00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:35.039
Lawyer Song chose Jiang Chen

00:19:36.079 --> 00:19:38.119
That is fair, he was the one who found the issue first

00:19:38.839 --> 00:19:40.319
See, this is exactly what I worry about

00:19:41.279 --> 00:19:42.720
Then the more moments like this you face

00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:44.000
the more complicated your feelings will get

00:19:45.839 --> 00:19:46.400
What will you do

00:19:46.559 --> 00:19:47.200
Even I cannot help feeling

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:49.240
it is a battlefield, a total mess of workplace and relationships

00:19:55.319 --> 00:19:56.920
Lawyer Song, this is what I have organized

00:19:56.920 --> 00:19:58.559
A comparison of the two games

00:20:03.079 --> 00:20:03.440
Very good

00:20:04.799 --> 00:20:05.200
Jiang Chen

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:06.599
Let me ask you something

00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:09.119
If you were the founder of Tian Kaixin

00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:11.039
would you want to go up against Rui E

00:20:11.039 --> 00:20:12.039
such a big company

00:20:12.319 --> 00:20:12.920
in a lawsuit

00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:16.079
What do you mean, Lawyer Song

00:20:16.559 --> 00:20:17.359
Earlier the Chief Executive Officer of

00:20:17.359 --> 00:20:17.839
Tian Kaixin

00:20:17.839 --> 00:20:19.079
said at our firm Jun'an

00:20:19.079 --> 00:20:20.319
they would rather not develop the game

00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:21.480
than not sue them

00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:23.240
These last few days

00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:24.839
I have been meeting daily with Tian Kaixin

00:20:24.839 --> 00:20:25.680
just to figure out

00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:26.880
what they really mean

00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:29.240
In our line of work as lawyers

00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:29.799
when it comes down to it

00:20:30.039 --> 00:20:31.799
we are a highly specialized service industry

00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:33.680
So no matter what you personally think

00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:36.000
understanding the client is what matters most

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:37.880
But sometimes

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.359
what the client says and what they think differ

00:20:40.759 --> 00:20:41.720
So before the meeting

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.039
we must make clear

00:20:43.039 --> 00:20:45.200
the client’s bottom line, stance, and needs

00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:49.039
So you mean that based on our judgment now

00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:50.160
they do not want to fight anymore

00:20:50.319 --> 00:20:50.799
Of course they do not

00:20:51.839 --> 00:20:52.240
Think about it

00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:53.160
Privately

00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:55.240
their founder does not at all want

00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:56.920
to fall out with his old startup partners

00:20:57.240 --> 00:20:57.759
Publicly

00:20:57.920 --> 00:20:58.880
he even less wants to tear things up with

00:20:58.880 --> 00:20:59.799
a company like Rui E

00:21:00.359 --> 00:21:01.000
They are just

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.079
a mid sized firm still in Series C financing

00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:04.119
How could they possibly

00:21:04.119 --> 00:21:05.480
take on a market giant like Rui E

00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:06.359
head on

00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:07.240
True

00:21:08.279 --> 00:21:10.160
Rui E is also for many other games

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:11.440
the publisher and agent

00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:13.880
Crossing them brings no benefit at all

00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:16.720
This is the difference between us non litigation lawyers

00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:18.039
and litigation lawyers

00:21:18.839 --> 00:21:20.839
In litigation there must be a winner and a loser

00:21:21.079 --> 00:21:22.079
In non litigation not necessarily

00:21:23.039 --> 00:21:24.640
If we can get our client and the other side

00:21:24.759 --> 00:21:25.640
to achieve a win win

00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:27.720
that is the way we solve problems

00:21:28.079 --> 00:21:29.759
Harmony is what is most valuable

00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:31.319
Peace is what brings profit

00:21:32.079 --> 00:21:33.079
All right, get your things ready

00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:34.559
you are coming with me in a bit

00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:36.079
Lawyer Song

00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:38.839
We still have four hours before the appointment

00:21:38.839 --> 00:21:40.160
Isn’t it a bit early to go now

00:21:42.839 --> 00:21:45.039
Have you heard of a Dawn Raid

00:21:47.559 --> 00:21:48.559
A so called Dawn Raid

00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:50.480
means going in without informing the other side

00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:51.240
and striking ahead of time

00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:53.279
so they have no time to prepare at all

00:21:53.359 --> 00:21:54.799
catching them completely off guard

00:21:56.759 --> 00:21:57.759
Using this time difference

00:21:57.839 --> 00:21:58.960
we first put the evidence on the table

00:21:59.119 --> 00:22:00.839
to put psychological pressure on them

00:22:01.119 --> 00:22:02.720
then get what you most want Hello

00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:04.119
in the shortest possible time

00:22:05.039 --> 00:22:06.000
The lawyers from Jun'an are here

00:22:06.319 --> 00:22:06.720
But

00:22:07.519 --> 00:22:08.160
this is not intimidation

00:22:09.759 --> 00:22:10.599
Hello, Lawyer Song

00:22:10.839 --> 00:22:12.079
I am the head of the game development team

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:14.599
Lawyer Song

00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:40.680
I do not know about this

00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:42.519
He brought all of this

00:23:24.599 --> 00:23:25.160
Lawyer Song

00:23:26.039 --> 00:23:28.000
Before the formal talks begin

00:23:28.519 --> 00:23:29.160
you

00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:31.599
conducted such a round of questioning

00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:32.759
which is highly inappropriate

00:23:33.119 --> 00:23:34.640
I believe you also do not want

00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:36.119
relations between Tian Kaixin and Rui E

00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:37.680
to suffer any unnecessary misunderstanding

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:44.400
Of course

00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:45.720
Lawyer Jiang

00:23:47.559 --> 00:23:48.279
Why do we not

00:23:49.079 --> 00:23:49.559
sit down and talk

00:23:55.599 --> 00:23:56.279
Step outside with me for a moment

00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:01.359
Your outfit clashes with this young man's

00:24:01.519 --> 00:24:02.319
It is all gray

00:24:07.119 --> 00:24:07.839
Lawyer Jiang said

00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:09.240
They are not here with good intentions

00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:10.279
Arriving early

00:24:10.279 --> 00:24:12.160
Is just to make you reveal more infringement details

00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:13.079
Or force you to admit infringement yourself

00:24:13.559 --> 00:24:15.319
Remember, once you go in

00:24:15.319 --> 00:24:16.720
As long as Lawyer Jiang does not let you speak

00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:17.880
You must not say anything

00:24:18.119 --> 00:24:18.920
That is the bottom line

00:24:19.279 --> 00:24:19.839
Got it?

00:24:22.839 --> 00:24:24.079
I do not really play games

00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:25.640
But my son

00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:27.880
Really loves playing games

00:24:28.279 --> 00:24:29.319
He once told me

00:24:30.319 --> 00:24:31.680
That games nowadays

00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:33.119
Have very similar types

00:24:34.039 --> 00:24:35.720
There are many similarities

00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:37.880
Which could completely be coincidences

00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:40.599
So we believe

00:24:41.079 --> 00:24:43.519
The overlaps Tian Kaixin Company raised

00:24:43.839 --> 00:24:44.759
Are purely accidental

00:24:45.279 --> 00:24:47.400
There is no infringement at all

00:24:48.359 --> 00:24:50.680
Regarding that newly hired employee you mentioned

00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:51.519
First

00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:53.160
Before he joined

00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:54.319
Rui E conducted

00:24:54.319 --> 00:24:55.559
A thorough background check on him

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:57.319
And on the day he started

00:24:57.640 --> 00:24:59.200
He signed a declaration

00:25:00.319 --> 00:25:02.319
This is the original declaration

00:25:03.799 --> 00:25:05.480
It clearly states

00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:06.480
He confirms

00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:09.000
That he did not bring from his previous employer

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:10.759
Any trade secrets

00:25:10.839 --> 00:25:11.480
Into Rui E

00:25:11.839 --> 00:25:12.160
Second

00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:13.759
After he joined

00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:15.039
Rui E Company would give him

00:25:15.039 --> 00:25:16.039
Strict training

00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:18.279
On the first page of the training materials

00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:19.920
The first rule is very clear

00:25:20.319 --> 00:25:21.160
It strictly forbids bringing

00:25:21.359 --> 00:25:23.039
Any company’s trade secrets

00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:23.839
Into Rui E

00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:26.000
What you are seeing now

00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:27.680
Is the relevant training material

00:25:28.119 --> 00:25:28.759
Based on the above

00:25:29.279 --> 00:25:31.680
We have every reason to believe

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.000
That even if everything you say is true

00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:36.119
It was purely this person’s individual act

00:25:36.559 --> 00:25:37.359
And Rui E Company

00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:38.519
Knew nothing about it

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:40.119
Now Rui E Company has decided

00:25:40.119 --> 00:25:41.119
To dismiss this employee

00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:42.039
And from now on

00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:44.480
Will not cooperate with him in any form

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:45.920
But the premise is

00:25:46.519 --> 00:25:47.480
We do not accept

00:25:47.799 --> 00:25:49.440
That Rui E Company, as you allege

00:25:49.519 --> 00:25:50.720
Committed any infringement

00:25:51.079 --> 00:25:51.759
At the same time

00:25:52.799 --> 00:25:55.079
We will not offer any form of apology

00:25:56.799 --> 00:25:57.680
As for this game

00:25:58.359 --> 00:25:59.079
Rui E Company

00:25:59.839 --> 00:26:00.880
Will also stop developing it

00:26:19.559 --> 00:26:20.119
Lawyer Song

00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:22.160
Please send my regards to Director Zhuang

00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:23.440
We are old friends

00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:24.519
We have not seen each other for many years

00:26:24.839 --> 00:26:25.240
Of course

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:27.039
I often hear the director mention you

00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:29.359
That must not be anything good

00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:32.480
I have not introduced you yet

00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:35.279
This is our firm’s intern, Jiang Chen

00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:37.200
He is also part of our Talent Recognition Program’s

00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:38.279
Outstanding candidates

00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:41.119
Hello, Lawyer Jiang

00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:47.720
Talent Recognition Program

00:26:49.799 --> 00:26:51.599
I am very interested in this program of yours

00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:53.319
I wonder if I might have the honor

00:26:53.599 --> 00:26:55.079
To visit your firm and learn a bit

00:26:55.519 --> 00:26:55.839
You are welcome

00:26:59.279 --> 00:27:00.240
Outstanding talent

00:27:01.359 --> 00:27:01.759
Not bad

00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:09.920
Old Zhuang

00:27:10.559 --> 00:27:12.279
When will you come over to my place for a visit

00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:12.880
Sure

00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:21.640
Sister Lucy

00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:22.880
Who is that?

00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:24.920
Director and Lawyer Song together, such a big scene.

00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:27.160
What is going on during work hours?

00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:27.519
Sis,

00:27:27.599 --> 00:27:28.359
Sister Duoduo,

00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:30.279
you came to gossip with our Lucy.

00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:32.359
I miss you like crazy every single day.

00:27:32.599 --> 00:27:33.720
I cannot stand staying at home.

00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:34.559
I really cannot stand it anymore.

00:27:34.559 --> 00:27:35.279
It is way too boring.

00:27:35.559 --> 00:27:36.759
I will be back at work next week.

00:27:37.119 --> 00:27:37.759
That is great.

00:27:37.839 --> 00:27:38.680
That is great.

00:27:39.119 --> 00:27:39.559
Ke,

00:27:40.319 --> 00:27:41.119
the one who just left,

00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:43.440
the director of the biggest firm in the Southwest,

00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:45.519
our Director Zhuang's college classmate,

00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:47.319
Director Jiang Ruocheng.

00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:48.480
Jiang Ruocheng.

00:27:52.319 --> 00:27:52.880
Jiang.

00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:03.200
Then staying at Jun'an is totally secure for him.

00:28:08.599 --> 00:28:09.279
Look at us,

00:28:09.279 --> 00:28:11.680
we work overtime all night just to go permanent.

00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:12.720
I mean, this, this, this...

00:28:12.759 --> 00:28:14.839
nothing beats having a good dad, seriously.

00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:15.920
We are all colleagues,

00:28:16.079 --> 00:28:16.880
and also friends.

00:28:17.359 --> 00:28:18.279
Do not talk about people behind their backs.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:20.440
Thanks.

00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:27.359
The reason he can stay here

00:28:27.559 --> 00:28:28.119
is something we all know.

00:28:28.119 --> 00:28:29.440
It is because of his own ability.

00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:31.359
Jiang Chen has beaten you and he has beaten me.

00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:33.799
If you doubt him, you are doubting us.

00:28:34.079 --> 00:28:34.799
Yes, yes, yes.

00:28:35.359 --> 00:28:36.119
I did not say anything.

00:28:37.599 --> 00:28:38.799
I am heading off, Sister Duoduo.

00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:43.640
Do you have time to come up to the rooftop?

00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:54.960
I just had a huge fight with my dad in the parking lot.

00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:57.920
He said I have never really suffered setbacks since childhood.

00:28:58.119 --> 00:28:59.839
And I am not especially competitive.

00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:03.240
He said some people are born to be lawyers,

00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:04.799
and some people are not.

00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:07.400
I am the kind who is not.

00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:12.359
He has forgotten everything.

00:29:14.599 --> 00:29:15.799
When I was little, we

00:29:16.759 --> 00:29:18.079
used to play house at home.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:21.000
My mom was the judge,

00:29:21.319 --> 00:29:22.160
he was the prosecutor,

00:29:23.279 --> 00:29:25.319
my toys played the parties,

00:29:26.359 --> 00:29:27.119
and I played the lawyer.

00:29:28.559 --> 00:29:30.400
I copied my dad's expressions,

00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:31.240
my dad's tone,

00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:32.960
and pretended to give a closing argument.

00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:34.400
They both laughed so happily.

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:35.880
My dad was the kind who

00:29:37.279 --> 00:29:38.359
would hold me and say, "Son,

00:29:40.799 --> 00:29:42.720
you will definitely be a good lawyer one day."

00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:47.640
He actually forgot all of that.

00:29:49.359 --> 00:29:50.960
Later on, he had

00:29:51.759 --> 00:29:52.359
a new family.

00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:53.720
He has a new wife

00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:54.880
and a new

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:56.480
son.

00:29:57.799 --> 00:29:59.279
We became like strangers.

00:30:00.799 --> 00:30:02.640
I do not even know when it started,

00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:04.480
but in his eyes I seem to have become

00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:05.960
someone who is not very capable.

00:30:07.119 --> 00:30:09.359
But who is he to say I am not fit to be a lawyer?

00:30:15.039 --> 00:30:15.519
Whatever.

00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:19.200
I do not care what he says.

00:30:22.319 --> 00:30:23.920
Are all fathers and sons like this?

00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:26.640
It is like there is a wall between them.

00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:27.599
They just cannot talk properly.

00:30:28.119 --> 00:30:28.720
Who else?

00:30:29.279 --> 00:30:30.880
My dad and my grandpa are the same.

00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:32.480
When I was a kid, I watched them

00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:34.160
eat a whole meal without saying a word.

00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:35.799
And I thought

00:30:36.279 --> 00:30:38.440
fathers and sons are so strange.

00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:40.000
They clearly love each other,

00:30:40.039 --> 00:30:41.000
really care about each other,

00:30:41.759 --> 00:30:42.960
but just cannot express it properly.

00:30:48.319 --> 00:30:49.559
He and I were never close to begin with.

00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:53.000
You even called me up to the rooftop because of him.

00:30:53.119 --> 00:30:54.039
And you say you are not close?

00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:57.200
You must really care how he sees you.

00:30:57.720 --> 00:30:58.400
No way.

00:30:59.079 --> 00:31:00.599
You want to be a lawyer because of him.

00:31:00.599 --> 00:31:01.440
How is that not possible?

00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:09.480
I think your dad talked like that

00:31:09.839 --> 00:31:11.200
probably because he was a bit angry

00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:12.960
you did not discuss such a big thing with him

00:31:13.599 --> 00:31:15.680
after all, he is a big shot lawyer with a reputation

00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:17.279
his own son graduated

00:31:17.279 --> 00:31:18.680
and went to intern at another law firm

00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:20.400
so where does that leave his pride

00:31:21.839 --> 00:31:22.640
But

00:31:22.839 --> 00:31:23.440
if he knew

00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:24.839
you are doing so well at Jun'an

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:26.359
he would definitely see you differently

00:31:28.079 --> 00:31:29.680
I did not become a lawyer because of my dad

00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:30.839
it was me

00:31:30.839 --> 00:31:32.400
after I really got to know this profession

00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:33.920
I realized I truly like it

00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:35.200
I want to make it

00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:36.960
a career I can fight for my whole life

00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:39.440
at least your dad enlightened you

00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:41.640
so you knew early on what you wanted

00:31:42.559 --> 00:31:44.200
then leave the rest to time

00:31:45.039 --> 00:31:46.279
I think you and your father

00:31:46.279 --> 00:31:48.680
agree when it comes to being lawyers

00:31:48.759 --> 00:31:50.440
so you are not necessarily opposed on other things

00:31:53.119 --> 00:31:53.680
not necessarily

00:31:54.359 --> 00:31:55.440
not necessarily opposed

00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:02.400
I got it

00:32:03.559 --> 00:32:04.799
not necessarily opposed, right

00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:08.519
I got your email at three in the morning

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:10.039
you really can stay up

00:32:11.279 --> 00:32:12.279
let me tell you again

00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:13.079
at our firm Jun'an

00:32:14.319 --> 00:32:15.319
we really do not encourage such late nights

00:32:15.839 --> 00:32:16.400
thank you, Lawyer Song

00:32:16.759 --> 00:32:17.119
sit

00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:20.000
tell me

00:32:20.599 --> 00:32:21.279
what are your thoughts

00:32:21.759 --> 00:32:22.279
Lawyer Song

00:32:22.559 --> 00:32:23.519
I did not expect

00:32:23.519 --> 00:32:24.359
that this time Rui E

00:32:24.359 --> 00:32:25.920
hired my father as their lawyer

00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:28.200
so obviously on this case

00:32:28.359 --> 00:32:29.279
I have a conflict of Interest

00:32:29.599 --> 00:32:31.440
so I would like to request to withdraw

00:32:32.359 --> 00:32:34.200
but I have also thought it through carefully

00:32:34.519 --> 00:32:35.079
I think

00:32:35.279 --> 00:32:37.400
the best way to solve this case now

00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:38.880
is to have Rui E Company

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:39.960
invest in Tian Kaixin

00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:44.160
how did you come up with this solution

00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:46.000
I was inspired by you as well

00:32:46.799 --> 00:32:48.400
did you not tell me before

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:49.799
that at the negotiation table

00:32:50.039 --> 00:32:51.839
it does not have to be you die I live

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:52.759
peace is more valuable

00:32:53.799 --> 00:32:55.279
and right now Rui E Company

00:32:55.319 --> 00:32:56.240
and Tian Kaixin Company

00:32:56.599 --> 00:32:58.400
their market size and share

00:32:58.720 --> 00:32:59.799
are a bit like a father son relationship

00:33:00.799 --> 00:33:02.359
a friend told me some time ago

00:33:02.599 --> 00:33:04.440
that fathers and sons are not necessarily opposed

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:06.160
if Rui E Company

00:33:06.319 --> 00:33:07.400
invests in Tian Kaixin

00:33:07.799 --> 00:33:10.160
and they develop this project together

00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:12.839
first the game quality will definitely improve

00:33:13.039 --> 00:33:14.640
second they will not have to fight each other

00:33:14.799 --> 00:33:15.680
for this small piece of the market

00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:17.240
most importantly

00:33:17.359 --> 00:33:18.920
Tian Kaixin's Series C Financing issue

00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:19.920
will be resolved

00:33:20.119 --> 00:33:21.720
and they will board the big ship of Rui E

00:33:22.319 --> 00:33:23.240
Rui E can also enjoy

00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:24.519
the exclusive agency rights for Tian Kaixin

00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:26.319
Jiang Chen

00:33:27.359 --> 00:33:27.839
very good

00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:30.839
your performance this time was truly outstanding

00:33:32.319 --> 00:33:33.759
I even want to steal you from Lawyer Bai

00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:35.039
by the way

00:33:37.039 --> 00:33:38.119
thank your friend for me

00:33:46.519 --> 00:33:47.119
what are you looking at

00:33:48.519 --> 00:33:49.039
nothing

00:33:52.519 --> 00:33:54.359
financing cases of other game companies

00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:55.200
right

00:33:56.559 --> 00:33:57.720
I guess

00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:00.680
you have been wanting to say

00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:02.240
that on that Rui E case

00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:03.119
you did so well

00:34:03.119 --> 00:34:04.240
of course I cannot fall behind

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:06.880
but now you have a conflict of Interest

00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:08.079
should you avoid any suspicion

00:34:11.079 --> 00:34:12.440
you are not even pretending, are you

00:34:12.639 --> 00:34:14.679
you are this happy just because I have a conflict of Interest

00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:16.400
you are smiling so wide I can see your wisdom teeth

00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:25.320
Come on, no, Master Jiang

00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:26.119
Convenience store food

00:34:26.119 --> 00:34:28.159
How could it match your brilliant brain

00:34:28.519 --> 00:34:29.440
Let me treat you to a real meal

00:34:29.719 --> 00:34:30.800
You can also walk me through

00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:31.920
Rui E's previous games

00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:34.760
You got it on your chin

00:34:36.559 --> 00:34:37.360
You already called me a master

00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:38.199
So what do you want to treat me to

00:34:41.519 --> 00:34:42.199
Or how about this

00:34:42.920 --> 00:34:43.679
We can do it another day

00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:45.199
Did you not just stay up all night

00:34:45.519 --> 00:34:46.760
It is fine, I have endless energy

00:34:47.079 --> 00:34:47.800
Do not push yourself

00:34:48.679 --> 00:34:50.000
If I can do it in the first place

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:51.039
Why would that be pushing it

00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:54.360
Did you not just call me a master

00:34:55.159 --> 00:34:55.599
I forgot

00:35:02.119 --> 00:35:03.840
Do you not usually avoid this stuff

00:35:05.639 --> 00:35:06.519
You really pay attention to me

00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:11.639
Do not move, turn around

00:35:13.039 --> 00:35:13.519
Come a bit closer

00:35:16.199 --> 00:35:17.239
That is a huge pimple

00:35:17.639 --> 00:35:18.639
Must be from overworking and getting run down

00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:19.960
Sorry

00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:21.559
We girls just want to poke pimples when we see them

00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:24.000
You did not have to press that hard though

00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:25.199
Well, someone just now

00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:26.320
Insisted on acting like a bossy CEO

00:35:27.119 --> 00:35:28.440
So arrogant, I could not help it

00:35:34.719 --> 00:35:35.599
It is all your fault

00:35:37.039 --> 00:35:37.480
What

00:35:39.159 --> 00:35:40.440
My fault, my fault

00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:43.280
When you are exhausted, spicy food makes it worse

00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:45.920
These two packs are on me

00:35:46.719 --> 00:35:47.440
Do not read too much into it

00:35:47.440 --> 00:35:48.400
Just take it as me treating you

00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:50.079
Labor fee for explaining Rui E's games

00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:53.920
It is an act of kindness, I get it, I will not overthink

00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:55.400
Then be a good person all the way

00:35:55.519 --> 00:35:56.679
Help me cook the noodles

00:35:58.639 --> 00:36:00.199
First, I only cook, I do not wash dishes

00:36:00.559 --> 00:36:02.039
Then I am really losing out as this so called master

00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:04.039
I will wash

00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:06.320
I will wash

00:36:20.440 --> 00:36:21.159
Honestly

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:22.880
People of our generation

00:36:23.199 --> 00:36:24.159
Are not good at expressing ourselves

00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:25.840
Between fathers and sons

00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:27.480
There is always some regret

00:36:28.639 --> 00:36:30.719
We can not let the next generation be like this

00:36:31.159 --> 00:36:31.800
You had better hurry

00:36:32.519 --> 00:36:33.679
Kick him out as the last in ranking

00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:35.199
Let him come home with me

00:36:35.679 --> 00:36:36.360
Go with you

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:39.519
I am about to open a branch in Beijing

00:36:41.719 --> 00:36:43.039
Our chances to meet in the future

00:36:43.199 --> 00:36:44.199
Will only get more and more

00:36:49.559 --> 00:36:50.960
If you really want to poach him

00:36:51.559 --> 00:36:53.039
Have your son tell me himself

00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:55.079
Otherwise I will not let him go easily

00:37:23.199 --> 00:37:24.599
You blocked your dad

00:37:25.559 --> 00:37:26.119
Why

00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:27.679
After that fight in the parking lot

00:37:27.679 --> 00:37:30.000
I blocked his calls and WeChat completely

00:37:30.239 --> 00:37:32.079
The whole operation took under three seconds

00:37:32.559 --> 00:37:33.239
Pretty impressive, right

00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:36.800
Do not worry

00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:38.199
He might not even notice

00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:39.119
He is an older man after all

00:37:39.119 --> 00:37:40.639
Once a year he calls me, if I am lucky

00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:42.119
What older man

00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:43.840
We are going to work as lawyers

00:37:44.119 --> 00:37:46.199
We must be factual about basic facts

00:37:46.639 --> 00:37:47.880
Your dad's looks

00:37:48.079 --> 00:37:49.599
are the upgraded, enhanced version of yours

00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:54.880
Your IQ is definitely online

00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:56.480
But your sense of beauty, well, it is just...

00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:00.559
If I were your dad

00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:01.679
seeing my own son

00:38:01.679 --> 00:38:03.320
do so outstandingly this time

00:38:03.559 --> 00:38:05.639
I would hide it, but I would be anxious inside

00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:06.800
I would be thinking about it every day

00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:08.679
how to fix my relationship with my son

00:38:09.079 --> 00:38:10.320
Losing a son is one thing

00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:11.599
but losing talent is not acceptable

00:38:12.079 --> 00:38:14.199
Otherwise in three to five years

00:38:14.559 --> 00:38:15.880
how high a salary would I have to offer

00:38:15.880 --> 00:38:18.000
to lure back such an excellent Lawyer Jiang

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:19.000
and get him to come back

00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:24.960
If that day really comes

00:38:25.119 --> 00:38:25.719
I will definitely

00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:28.000
just smile calmly

00:38:28.199 --> 00:38:29.159
and then tell him

00:38:30.639 --> 00:38:31.199
Lawyer Jiang

00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:32.719
I am really sorry

00:38:33.679 --> 00:38:34.679
but for this tiny bit of money

00:38:34.679 --> 00:38:36.000
our lawyers at Jun'an

00:38:36.679 --> 00:38:37.599
really would not be interested

00:38:40.079 --> 00:38:40.639
See you in a bit

00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:44.440
How much do they pay you that you look down on it

00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:48.159
How did you get in

00:38:48.599 --> 00:38:51.320
Your aunt told me you insisted on living alone

00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:52.760
so I came to take a look

00:38:54.039 --> 00:38:55.400
How many times have I reminded you

00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:57.760
Do not use your birthday as a password

00:38:58.599 --> 00:38:59.280
It is not safe

00:38:59.559 --> 00:39:00.679
It really is not safe

00:39:04.199 --> 00:39:04.679
Hello

00:39:05.480 --> 00:39:06.840
Hello, Lawyer Jiang

00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:09.719
You are Chen Chen's...

00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:11.119
I am Jiang Chen's colleague

00:39:11.239 --> 00:39:12.159
My name is Ren Jiatong

00:39:13.239 --> 00:39:14.719
We are colleagues from the Talent Recognition Program

00:39:15.159 --> 00:39:16.280
Your director told me

00:39:16.679 --> 00:39:18.400
each of you is exceptionally outstanding

00:39:18.719 --> 00:39:19.920
Thank you, Lawyer Jiang

00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:21.679
I am neighbors with Jiang Chen

00:39:21.679 --> 00:39:22.400
I live across the hall

00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:24.320
Neighbors

00:39:27.039 --> 00:39:28.559
He has a female colleague living here too

00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:29.719
She happens to be on her way back

00:39:29.719 --> 00:39:30.679
I will go grab something

00:39:30.679 --> 00:39:31.559
You two go ahead and talk

00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:42.000
So she is that Ren Jiatong

00:39:42.559 --> 00:39:42.880
Yeah

00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:45.679
You investigated quite thoroughly

00:39:47.199 --> 00:39:49.559
Why must my son stay at Jun'an

00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:51.320
Why does he insist

00:39:51.559 --> 00:39:53.679
on moving out to live alone

00:39:54.679 --> 00:39:56.159
Then who does he usually spend time with

00:39:56.840 --> 00:39:57.960
As his father

00:39:58.719 --> 00:40:00.199
should I not understand that

00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:03.679
Try to have at least some sense of boundaries

00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:07.360
Being a father is not the same as being a detective

00:40:08.239 --> 00:40:09.599
I called you before I came

00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:10.480
but it did not go through

00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:12.760
Your phone

00:40:14.119 --> 00:40:14.800
has bad reception

00:40:15.199 --> 00:40:17.119
I downloaded an anti-harassment call app

00:40:17.119 --> 00:40:18.559
an anti-scam call app

00:40:19.719 --> 00:40:20.599
Seems it works pretty well

00:40:21.119 --> 00:40:21.960
It even blocked you

00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:23.760
As a lawyer

00:40:24.679 --> 00:40:25.880
that kind of habit is really not good

00:40:39.119 --> 00:40:40.679
When I had just started working

00:40:41.079 --> 00:40:43.199
my mentor told me many rules of this profession.

00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:44.199
One of them was

00:40:44.679 --> 00:40:45.559
as a lawyer,

00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:47.400
you must have at least one good suit.

00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:49.480
Custom-made is best.

00:40:50.199 --> 00:40:51.199
But if a person

00:40:51.199 --> 00:40:52.559
does not yet have enough money

00:40:52.719 --> 00:40:54.960
and the professional ability to match,

00:40:55.440 --> 00:40:56.599
they can wear off-the-rack suits.

00:40:57.199 --> 00:40:58.679
I have seen those suits of yours.

00:40:59.599 --> 00:41:00.360
The style is not bad.

00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:03.719
But the fabric is far too rough.

00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:05.519
One look and it screams cheap.

00:41:10.239 --> 00:41:11.119
Thanks, Lawyer Jiang.

00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:12.800
In the middle of your super busy schedule,

00:41:13.039 --> 00:41:14.159
you still found time to lecture me.

00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:18.320
Those suits I gave you,

00:41:18.840 --> 00:41:19.679
why do you not wear them?

00:41:20.039 --> 00:41:20.800
How could I dare wear them?

00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:22.679
I have to hang them up

00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:23.800
and use them to motivate myself.

00:41:24.320 --> 00:41:25.360
I reflect on myself three times a day:

00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:27.159
I will strive, like you,

00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:29.159
to become a big shot in this field as soon as possible.

00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:30.239
Jiang Chen,

00:41:31.480 --> 00:41:32.400
you can hold a grudge against me,

00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:34.679
but those suits are good stuff.

00:41:35.199 --> 00:41:37.400
You can wear the suits I gave you

00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:39.880
and still keep your opinions of me in your heart.

00:41:40.159 --> 00:41:40.800
Representing Jun'an,

00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:44.079
fight a few beautiful lawsuits against me.

00:41:44.360 --> 00:41:45.719
That is what I call real promise.

00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:47.840
So what exactly did you come here to tell me?

00:41:48.360 --> 00:41:50.239
I wanted to see how my son, Jiang Ruocheng's boy,

00:41:51.159 --> 00:41:53.159
chases the girl he likes while wearing off-the-rack suits,

00:41:53.400 --> 00:41:54.599
eating instant noodles.

00:41:55.239 --> 00:41:56.559
What do you mean, I...

00:41:58.320 --> 00:41:59.519
She and I, we...

00:42:00.559 --> 00:42:01.840
it is not what you think.

00:42:14.639 --> 00:42:15.280
What is going on?

00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:16.920
Were we not going to Jiang Chen's place for dinner?

00:42:18.039 --> 00:42:18.960
Let us be clear first:

00:42:19.239 --> 00:42:20.159
I am exhausted today.

00:42:20.159 --> 00:42:22.119
You two are not allowed to trick me into cooking noodles.

00:42:23.360 --> 00:42:24.280
His dad is at home.

00:42:29.119 --> 00:42:30.199
Oh my god.

00:42:30.199 --> 00:42:31.039
I am dead tired.

00:42:31.639 --> 00:42:33.159
You have no idea how much work I did today.

00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:36.559
Even so, I still squeezed out time

00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:38.000
to pester Lawyer Song to explain to me

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:38.800
the details of their last trip to Rui E

00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:39.679
for negotiations.

00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:42.039
That lawyer on the other side was incredibly good.

00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:43.679
It was amazing.

00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:46.800
But there were several parts I did not really understand.

00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:49.280
I need to get another lesson on it another day.

00:42:55.480 --> 00:42:56.000
Xiaoyu,

00:42:56.920 --> 00:42:57.840
do you want to hear

00:42:57.840 --> 00:42:58.920
this top lawyer Rui E hired

00:42:58.920 --> 00:43:00.039
personally give you a lesson?

00:43:00.039 --> 00:43:01.119
and tutor you himself?

00:43:05.840 --> 00:43:06.440
Is it him?

00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:10.760
This is Jiang Chen's dad.
