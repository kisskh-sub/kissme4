[Reborn from the Ashes]

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.440
[Episode 11]

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:14.880
Wen Yueqian.

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:31.150
What did you say?

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.200
You've been staring
at Wen Yueqian's memorial tablet.

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:35.960
I thought you knew her.

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:40.750
Your Highness, we should go back.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.270
You still haven't answered me.

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:56.320
Your Highness,

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.440
we are the host today.

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.000
We've been out too long.

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:01.960
We might be neglecting Prince Han.

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.270
Your Highness, Prince Han sent me
to find you and Her Highness.

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.040
See? Even Prince Han is urging us.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:19.800
Mother.

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.630
Su Qingran somehow learned archery.

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.800
She shone brilliantly at the banquet.

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.480
What's more, she must've used
some bewitching tricks

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.690
to get the crown prince
to look for medicine for her.

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.270
That cured the scars on her face.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.400
Her face has healed?

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:38.270
Mother,

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.070
the crown prince won't spare me
a glance.

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:42.480
What should I do?

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.000
Instead of daydreaming
about useless things,

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.800
you'd better learn more from Qingran.

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.360
You really embarrassed me.

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:00.150
Go back and reflect on yourself.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.520
Why didn't you say such things before?

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.270
It's just because

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.840
Su Qingran became the crown princess

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:12.960
and you want to curry favor with her,

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.270
while neglecting the two of us.

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.110
Gong Xi, enough.

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.000
Let me tell you,

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.630
Su Qingran hates you.

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.550
You abandoned her all these years.

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.320
What feelings could you possibly have?

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.840
She will never be your ally.

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.400
She's nothing but trouble.

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.150
Poor Shixian,

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:37.800
he died so mysteriously.

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.320
He was the only son of the Gong Family.

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.750
How am I supposed
to explain this to them?

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:46.320
Crying like this is hardly dignified.

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:48.360
Madam,

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.190
my family came
to demand answers yesterday.

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:52.880
They say the family lineage has ended.

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:55.040
The Gong Family's lineage,

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.880
let it end then.

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:57.670
With a nephew like yours,

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:58.880
the lineage

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.150
will eventually die out.

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.040
You should worry more
about the Su Family's lineage.

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.150
Look at your belly,

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:07.520
so disappointing.

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:08.670
All these years,

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.270
you still haven't given birth to a son.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.230
Madam,

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:14.480
you shouldn't say things like that.

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.360
If you want fertile fields
to yield crops,

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.070
someone has to till the soil
and sow the seeds.

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.710
Your son has taken tonic for years,

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:27.750
but there's been no sign of improvement.

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:29.270
Xi,

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.550
didn't we agree not to bring this up?

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.630
We were discussing the Gong Family,

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:35.960
so why drag this matter into it?

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.670
I'm concerned about the Su Family.

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.440
After all, Shixian had this accident
in our mansion.

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:45.070
I fear they might act recklessly

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:48.230
and do something harmful
to the Su Family.

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:52.750
So, what do you suggest we do?

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:54.440
How about

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:57.270
we pay a visit
to Prince Zhenbei's Mansion

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.320
and speak with Su Qingran?

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.250
She's the one
who stirred up this matter,

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:02.400
so let her resolve it.

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:04.110
If she manages to calm things down,

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.150
the Gong Family will remember
our kindness.

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:07.920
If she ignores it,

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:12.400
after all, we did try
to seek justice for her.

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:14.960
But Prince Zhenbei's Mansion
holds too much power.

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:17.040
We are truly helpless.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.670
This way,

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.880
all the blame could be placed
on Su Qingran.

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:26.750
Then our family could walk away clean.

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:28.840
Who should go?

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:34.480
Why not have the Madam go?

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:37.440
I'm not going.

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.360
I still want to live a few more years.

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:40.630
You ungrateful wretch,

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:42.840
just wait for me to die early.

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:44.550
Ungrateful? Me?

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.230
Su Qingran is the real ungrateful one.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.840
She even insulted our family
at the banquet.

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.840
Who knows what worse things
she might do next?

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:56.710
If the one marrying the crown prince
were Feiyi,

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.110
who knows how many benefits
it could bring to us?

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.960
Wasn't it your lousy idea back then

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:05.790
to insist on bringing Su Qingran back
to be a substitute bride?

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:08.750
Otherwise, Yi would
be the crown princess by now.

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:11.110
I was just offering a suggestion.

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:14.190
In the end, isn't it still you
who makes the final decision?

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:15.520
If you didn't approve,

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.230
how could we dare act on our own?

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:19.040
Qingran

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:20.710
really forgets where she came from.

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:22.590
This time when she returns,

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:25.150
we must properly teach her the rules.

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:28.400
Let her remember where her roots lie.

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:32.800
[Su Mansion]

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:38.400
When Qingran returns this time,

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:40.520
we must teach her a lesson.

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:45.590
With the crown prince here,
it's probably tricky to do that.

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:51.000
Since she has entered the door,

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:53.590
we certainly have ways to deal with her.

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:57.150
Yi, you must behave well

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:59.440
and win the crown prince's favor.

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:01.320
I see, Mother.

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:04.040
No matter how late she arrives,

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:06.190
we'll wait until she shows up.

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:07.360
This time,

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:09.520
we have to teach her a lesson.

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:31.550
Why does my head hurt so much?

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:55.040
You drank way too much
with Prince Han last night.

00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:59.320
Honestly, I almost thought
you were his wife.

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:01.440
Your Highness, you...

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:03.710
Jealous, huh?

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:07.590
Impossible.

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:09.190
You don't even like me.

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:11.750
You're my woman.

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:13.960
Yesterday you drank so much
with Prince Han

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:16.190
that I had to carry you back.

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:20.000
You've really embarrassed our family.

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:22.920
Did I embarrass myself?

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:25.070
Now that you're sober,

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:26.150
then go back.

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:29.440
Look at me. I almost forgot.

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:31.400
What time is it now?

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:33.710
A quarter past three.

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:38.750
If I go back at this hour,
won't that just cause trouble?

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:39.800
I'm not going back today.

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:40.650
I'll return tomorrow.

00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:45.880
Wait, why are you so eager?

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:49.070
I am just upholding
the family's reputation.

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:52.040
Otherwise, outsiders might think
we lack proper manners.

00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:54.230
Alright then.

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:57.840
I'll accompany you back tomorrow.

00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:07.840
Why does he leave just like that?

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:14.960
Jin, Qingran,

00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:18.880
how did you know I was coming to see you
and wander around Yunzhou City?

00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:23.270
It seems that you are all ready.

00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:25.960
I...

00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:27.230
We are going...

00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:28.840
I came to Yunzhou City this time

00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:31.640
because I heard
this city is rich in resources

00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:33.290
and blessed with enchanting scenery.

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:36.680
Today, you two must give me a good show.

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:37.600
Or else,

00:08:38.310 --> 00:08:41.880
I have to report it to Prince Zhenbei.

00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:47.110
Looks like we can't go back today.

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:53.000
[Su Mansion]

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:55.960
That annoying Su Qingran

00:08:56.390 --> 00:08:58.190
made us wait in vain all day yesterday.

00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:02.510
When she comes back today,
we won't let her off easy.

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:06.880
It's not even the right time
for Buddhist worship now.

00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:08.370
Why hasn't Grandmother shown up yet?

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:11.610
You really think
she's doing Buddhist worship?

00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:13.230
She's just making excuses

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:14.760
because it's cold.

00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:26.270
Xuan,

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:28.600
why didn't you bring me out
with you today?

00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:30.490
Luckily, I was smart enough
to follow along.

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:33.270
Greetings, Your Highness.

00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:35.640
Where are you off to today?

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:36.840
Just wandering around.

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:38.720
Why don't you take me with you?

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:49.510
Here.

00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:02.430
These candied hawthorns
are absolutely delicious.

00:10:06.430 --> 00:10:09.190
Ran, why don't you give it a try?

00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:27.230
You really know how to stir things up.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.800
[Su Mansion]

00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:55.190
This weather is perfect for hot pot.

00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:56.880
Today we enjoy hot pot with wine,

00:10:57.090 --> 00:10:57.900
carefree and happy.

00:10:58.600 --> 00:10:59.000
Here.

00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:06.960
How about

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:08.390
you give it to me?

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:16.430
That way, everyone will have some
in their bowl.

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:20.720
[Su Mansion]

00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:33.350
Prince Han asked the crown princess
to join the outing today.

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:34.390
So, she will not return.

00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:36.370
She will definitely come back tomorrow.

00:11:56.390 --> 00:12:00.070
Wanyan Jin changes his mind faster
than the weather.

00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:02.800
He said he wouldn't come back,
and he really didn't.

00:12:37.070 --> 00:12:38.680
That annoying Su Qingran.

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:40.310
Today, I won't be fooled again.

00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:45.430
Concubine Gong,

00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:46.820
the crown princess has returned.

00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:50.350
Where is she?

00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:53.310
I saw her getting into a carriage
at the palace gate and heading this way,

00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:54.600
so I hurried back to report it.

00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:56.000
And more,

00:12:56.190 --> 00:12:59.000
I also saw that she was returning alone.

00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:00.660
The crown prince did not accompany her.

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:03.720
Someone!

00:13:04.430 --> 00:13:06.040
Bring all things out.

00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:08.510
Let's go.

00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:17.190
I want to use this chance
to find the account book

00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:18.960
to clear my father's name.

00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:21.310
The crown prince really
doesn't care about her.

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:23.920
Only she comes back.

00:13:26.390 --> 00:13:27.310
What does this mean?

00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:30.190
It's just to ward off bad luck for you.

00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:31.480
You have a bad fate chart.

00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:33.200
You caused your mother's death
when you were young.

00:13:33.210 --> 00:13:35.160
Later, you almost brought harm
to Grandmother.

00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:37.300
Luckily, Grandmother is blessed
with great fortune.

00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:39.430
And now, you've caused
Shixian's death as well.

00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:43.350
We're doing this
for the crown prince's own good.

00:13:44.270 --> 00:13:46.470
Qingran, be careful not

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:48.840
to bring misfortune to the crown prince.

00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:50.430
Fine then.

00:13:59.430 --> 00:14:00.640
I return to my parental home.

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:02.110
You not only humiliate me,

00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:03.670
but also curse the crown prince to die.

00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:06.190
Do you really think
Prince Zhenbei's Mansion means nothing?

00:14:06.210 --> 00:14:08.690
The crown prince was unwilling
to accompany you for the return,

00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:11.230
and did not even prepare the gift
that signifies status,

00:14:11.510 --> 00:14:13.560
letting you come back empty-handed.

00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:15.390
Do you think he'll back you up?

00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:17.270
Even if the crown prince comes,

00:14:17.470 --> 00:14:19.230
you still have to dispel the bad luck.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.190
Bring black dog's blood here.
