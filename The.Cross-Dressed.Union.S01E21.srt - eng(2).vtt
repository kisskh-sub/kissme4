00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.480
But this is a business matter.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.200
Let their business do better.

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:52.480
If something happens,

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:53.960
just explain it clearly.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.360
How should we talk about this?

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:56.400
Father.

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:57.600
Are you all right?

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:58.600
I'm fine.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.040
Let's discuss it later.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.040
This problem isn't solved yet,

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.120
and another one pops up.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.080
Did I say it wrong just now?

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:12.720
YOUR MAJESTY ARRIVES

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.720
Paying respects to Your Majesty.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:28.600
All ministers, rise.

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.960
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.320
Present your matters.

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.640
If there's nothing, court is dismissed.

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:37.240
Your servant.

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.080
I have a memorial.

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.600
It's rare for Prime Minister Ming to submit a memorial.

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.000
Let me hear it.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.240
What is it about?

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:46.880
I report

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.320
General of the North, Nan Hongyi,

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.200
violated the rites set by the Late Emperor,

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.680
concealing his son Nan Chenxiao's true gender.

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.240
Such intent deserves punishment.

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:02.400
Majesty...

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:03.320
Your Majesty.

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.080
There is absolutely no such thing!

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:06.400
Prime Minister Ming,

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.400
don't make baseless accusations!

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.720
This concerns the previous dynasty.

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.400
How could I speak carelessly about it?

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:15.360
Your Majesty.

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.240
Yesterday, my family

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.280
was attacked at our estate outside the city.

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.920
After capturing the culprit,

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.000
I discovered

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.400
he was the assassin who escaped at the last banquet.

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.200
A Da Yue killer.

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.240
After my interrogation,

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:35.800
I learned these Da Yue people

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.880
took such risks

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.240
to come to Ling An

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.120
not only to assassinate King Wurong,

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:44.440
but also to seek

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.800
revenge on the one who killed their king,

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:49.480
Young Master Beicheng.

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:52.240
He confirmed

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:55.000
the one married to Second Rank Grand Scholar

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.000
Rui Yu,

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.640
Nan Chenxiao, the only daughter of the Nan family,

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:02.040
is actually

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.680
Young Master Beicheng.

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:08.600
The Young Master Beicheng King Wurong sought is her.

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:10.600
Isn't she a woman?

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.680
So she is Young Master Beicheng.

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.800
Your Majesty.

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.440
Nan Chenxiao is already my wife.

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.680
I know her best.

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.640
The Nan family's son died at the border.

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.560
How can we trust such a schemer's accusation?

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.040
How can it be believed?

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:33.400
Whether it's true or not,

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.200
just bring Nan Chenxiao here,

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:36.120
and everything

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.800
will be clear.

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.840
Your Majesty.

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:41.080
Your servant.

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.880
I have followed

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:43.320
the Late Emperor's order

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.560
to investigate the exile of military officers.

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:47.320
Due to my oversight,

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.720
the Nan family kept this child.

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:51.680
It has caused trouble until now.

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.560
They not only hid their identity,

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.000
deceived the sovereign,

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.520
but also brought Wurong and Da Yue people.

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:59.480
In our country,

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:01.280
they stir up trouble

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:02.880
and act recklessly.

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:04.040
Fortunately,

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:05.600
it hasn't led to disaster.

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:09.080
Please summon Nan Chenxiao to the palace quickly,

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:11.640
to verify her identity.

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:24.560
Your Majesty.

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:31.680
Do as Prime Minister Ming says.

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:32.960
Li Quan.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.360
Your old servant will go at once.

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:08.200
Reporting to Your Majesty,

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:09.960
your old servant has confirmed.

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:11.320
Rui's wife—

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:12.080
No,

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:13.280
Nan Chenxiao

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:14.680
is indeed male.

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:15.400
What?

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:16.520
A man?

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:17.600
A man?

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:19.320
How bold!

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:24.120
Nan Hongyi,

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:26.360
do you know

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:28.640
violating the Late Emperor's order

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:30.920
and deceiving the sovereign

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:34.480
is a crime punishable by extermination of the nine clans!

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:40.760
I beg Your Majesty to punish us.

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:47.600
Nan Chenxiao.

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:49.440
I personally decreed

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:51.240
your marriage to Rui Yu.

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:53.000
All under heaven know

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:54.960
I arranged this marriage.

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:58.440
Today you confess before all officials,

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:01.600
do you mean to shame me?

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:03.800
I beg for punishment of the Nan family.

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:08.240
Your Majesty.

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:09.680
Your servant is willing to accept

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:10.240
the punishment for the Nan family.

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:15.160
Reporting to Your Majesty,

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:16.720
Prince of Pingxiang sent a secret letter.

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:18.120
Regent King Hou Qi

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:19.680
leads troops to besiege Pingxiang Palace.

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:21.560
Requests our dynasty to send reinforcements.

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:28.800
Your Majesty

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:31.080
Our court just formed a new alliance
with Pingxiang.

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:32.080
To set an example,

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:33.360
we must send troops to assist.

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:35.440
Only then can we bring peace
to all lands.

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:38.000
The Left Minister speaks wisely.

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:40.200
Sending troops is not up for debate.

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:42.000
However,

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:43.760
the position of commander

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:45.920
should be given to whom?

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:50.480
Your Majesty,

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:52.520
though the Nan family is guilty,

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:55.720
on the Pingxiang battlefield,

00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:57.200
none of the generals present

00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:59.000
know it as well as General Nan.

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:01.880
Let General Nan atone with merit.

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:03.720
The guilty Nan Chenxiao
will serve in the army.

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:05.480
Let them serve the nation.

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:06.840
Absurd!

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:09.480
War is no child's play.

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:11.760
The Nan family deceived
Your Majesty—a capital crime.

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:13.440
Rui Yu, your words

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:15.960
are to excuse the Nan family?

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:17.160
The battlefield is perilous.

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:18.520
Moreover,

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:20.320
we are only aiding Pingxiang.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.240
The Nan family is already guilty.

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:24.880
If anything happens in battle,

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:26.920
it serves as their punishment.

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:29.880
Reducing Ling An's losses

00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:31.560
is our top priority.

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:33.680
What does the Left Minister think?

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:35.760
Your Majesty,

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:38.600
the border is in crisis.

00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:41.280
Since General of Manifest Valor
fell for the nation,

00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:45.200
no young talent has emerged at court.

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:48.600
I believe the Nan family
should atone by leading the army.

00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:49.800
For Ling An,

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:51.600
to relieve our troubles.

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:52.960
If so,

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:54.040
Nan Chenxiao

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:55.080
will join the army at once.

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:56.040
Nan Hongyi

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:57.600
will marshal troops to Pingxiang.

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:02.560
However,

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:04.560
the Capital Guard Commander post

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:06.600
is vacant again.

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:10.600
Vice Minister of War Wei Ming

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:14.400
has long managed the capital's troops.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.520
No one at court

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:18.840
knows this role better than him.

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:21.120
Let him take the post for now.

00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:23.000
When Nan Hongyi

00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:24.840
returns victorious,

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:26.160
his name will be cleared.

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:28.840
He can resume the post.

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:31.280
Let it be as Prime Minister Ming suggests.

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:35.280
The expedition must not be delayed.

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:35.960
The Six Ministries

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:37.720
must give full support.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.560
Your Majesty is wise.

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:00.840
This is most excellent.

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:02.000
Rui Yu,

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:06.160
Rui Yu,

00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:08.680
after being deceived

00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:10.040
so deeply by the Nan family,

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:11.120
still in court,

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:12.960
you plead for them.

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:14.320
Truly,

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:16.640
I am impressed.

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:19.120
I am thinking for the nation too.

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:20.880
Now is the time to use talent.

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:22.440
War is coming to the border.

00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:24.560
We officials

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:27.280
should avoid blame.

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:30.400
What did you say?

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:34.360
Prime Minister Ming,

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:36.520
I have matters at home.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.120
I, Rui, take my leave.

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:42.440
With General Nan, victory is assured.

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:43.440
Thank you for your kind words.

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:45.840
I will not fail to quell Pingxiang's unrest.

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:48.240
Leave coordination of the Six Ministries to me.

00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:49.280
Thank you, Left Minister.

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:50.840
He trained in martial arts since childhood.

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:51.880
Finally, it is useful.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:52.600
Indeed.

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:53.880
No, no.

00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:55.880
I still don't get it.

00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:58.000
You—say it again.

00:10:58.720 --> 00:10:59.680
I said,

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:02.000
Chenxiao is actually a man
disguised as a woman.

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:05.280
The marriage was to shield the Nan family,

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:08.400
and to restore Chenxiao's identity one day.

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:10.400
To reopen the martial exam.

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:16.240
Did you know this?

00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:17.640
I...

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:18.360
I did know.

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:20.040
When did you find out?

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:21.920
Probably

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:23.880
when we first met at the cliff.

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:26.880
You knew and kept it from us,

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:28.640
making me and Father

00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:30.200
look like fools.

00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:32.240
Who said I didn't know?

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:34.960
When he offered tea,

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:36.200
I saw through it.

00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:39.760
That's called seeing but not revealing.

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:42.440
Father, your acting was so real.

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:44.880
No wonder you became a hands-off manager.

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:46.760
So,

00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:48.680
only I felt sorry for you.

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:52.080
You were devising strategies here.

00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:57.640
Ling An

00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:00.120
is about to enter

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:01.800
a new era of prosperity.

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:04.680
Well done, Yu'er.

00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:06.400
Our Rui family

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:08.720
must protect the court,

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:11.000
defend the worthy, remove the wicked,

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:13.360
and uphold Ling An's

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:15.280
legacy

00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:16.960
and prosperity.

00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:39.080
Your Majesty,

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:43.800
Your Majesty,

00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:57.400
I still remember

00:12:57.920 --> 00:12:59.480
when I let you found the Hidden Pavilion.

00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:02.920
It was the year of your capping ceremony.

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:04.000
Before that,

00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:05.880
we were just wandering scholars.

00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:07.360
Thanks to Your Majesty,

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:08.760
we found our place.

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:12.320
You travel between many nations,

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:14.040
and know the border terrain well.

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:15.280
With you along,

00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:16.600
our chances are greater.

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:18.000
Tomorrow morning,

00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:21.240
Chong Ming will escort you to Pingxiang
to prepare.

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:22.640
Welcome the main force through the pass.

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:24.400
This commoner

00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:26.000
will not fail Your Majesty's trust.

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:29.160
The situation is complicated now.

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:31.880
The deepest root is yet to be found.

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:34.120
You are the sword hidden in the shadows.

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:36.840
Never reveal your identity lightly.

00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:39.400
Your servant obeys.

00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:43.680
When you return,

00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:46.600
I will personally reward and promote you.

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:53.760
Let's talk about it when you return.

00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:55.440
Yes.

00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:56.720
Your servant takes his leave.

00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:07.240
Nan Chenxiao.

00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:08.200
Fall in.

00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:09.680
Stand by.

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:10.560
Yes.

00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:11.120
Mother.

00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:13.560
I'm heading to the front.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.160
Please take care of yourself.

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:19.320
This is an amulet I made for you.

00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:22.160
Inside is a peace charm I got for you.

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:23.760
Be sure to keep it with you.

00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:29.680
I understand, Mother.

00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:36.440
Nan Chenxiao.

00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:39.200
My child.

00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:41.680
I'll wait for your triumphant return.

00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:44.200
I'll be back soon.

00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:48.760
Nan Chenxiao.

00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:53.720
Mother.

00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:55.880
Why are you here?

00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:57.480
I came to see you off.

00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:00.800
I'll wait for you at the camp.

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:02.400
But don't be late.

00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:03.960
I understand.

00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:07.400
Let me take you somewhere.

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:16.760
I used to come here often.

00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:18.840
To overlook all of Jingdu Cheng.

00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:21.120
Thinking that one day, sooner or later,

00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:23.720
I could walk openly in this city.

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:26.040
And be part of this flourishing era.

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:30.120
Now,

00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:32.360
I can finally see hope.

00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:45.320
I couldn't tell you in advance.

00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:48.160
Sorry for making you worry.

00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:51.560
I know it happened suddenly.

00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:53.360
How could I blame you?

00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:55.320
It's just...

00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:57.400
After I leave,

00:15:58.560 --> 00:15:59.880
please take good care of yourself.

00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:03.080
Don't stay up too late reading.

00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:09.920
I'm doing well in the capital.

00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:11.680
Don't worry.

00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:14.240
I'll be back soon.

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:29.000
Second Prince of Qian Yuan.

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:31.480
Why did he suddenly ask Ling An to send the hostage back?

00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:33.440
Hasn't he always sided with the prince—

00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:35.640
Qian Yuan must have heard about Pingxiang's unrest.

00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:37.680
And that Ling An sent troops to help.

00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:42.760
Ling An once let Pingxiang's hostage return early.

00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:46.080
Now Qian Yuan wants Pan Zi Zhai to return.

00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:47.920
If Ling An refuses,

00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:49.960
they'll have a reason to start a war.

00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:52.400
Qian Yuan and Pingxiang are far apart.

00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:54.400
Once this happened,

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:56.640
Ling An tried to block the news.

00:16:57.080 --> 00:16:59.320
But Qian Yuan learned so quickly,

00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:00.720
which means in the court,

00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:02.280
there are Qian Yuan spies.

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:04.600
Left Minister.

00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:08.400
Start investigating this at once.

00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:11.360
Be sure to root out the pests of the nation

00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:12.680
one by one.

00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:13.920
Yes.

00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:18.360
Your Majesty, what do you think

00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:21.320
about arranging Prince Pan's return?

00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:24.520
He first asked to marry Prime Minister Ming's daughter at the envoy banquet.

00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:25.280
Ming Wanwan.

00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:28.280
This morning, he petitioned me in the palace.

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:30.760
He wants to strengthen ties through marriage.

00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:32.800
If I don't agree,

00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:36.120
it would make Ling An seem petty.

00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:42.400
Your Majesty.

00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:45.080
Miss Ming has entered the palace.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.080
You may return first.

00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:50.480
As for the marriage alliance,

00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:53.280
I must discuss it further with the Ming family.

00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:56.880
Your servant takes his leave.

00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:05.120
Left Minister, Lord Rui.

00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:10.360
Miss Ming, please.

00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:14.680
Your servant greets Your Majesty.

00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:16.320
Rise.

00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:17.960
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:21.640
Now,

00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:23.640
Now Pan Zi Zhai brings up

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:25.120
the marriage proposal again.

00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:27.840
Your father also submitted a memorial.

00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:29.240
He agreed to it.

00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:29.960
But I

00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:32.920
still want to hear your thoughts.

00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:35.000
If I marry Pan Zi Zhai,

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:37.280
will it ease Your Majesty's worries?

00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:40.240
If you marry Pan Zi Zhai,

00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:42.880
it will surely strengthen our nations' ties.

00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:44.720
It would be a great merit.

00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:49.120
What do I need such merit for?

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.080
If you are unwilling,

00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:53.440
If I am unwilling,

00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:55.680
would Your Majesty take me as a consort?

00:18:56.680 --> 00:18:57.440
No.

00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:03.240
I'm just an official's daughter.

00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:06.120
Merit only brings honor to my father.

00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:08.800
If I can ease Your Majesty's worries,

00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:11.480
I am willing to marry.

00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:17.400
Perhaps I

00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:21.480
can find you a better match.

00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:26.880
That would just be another official.

00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:29.320
Not as noble as a princess consort.

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:33.040
But if I marry as the prime minister's daughter,

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:34.720
would it be improper?

00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:37.360
I'll have the Queen Mother adopt you.

00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:40.880
You'll marry as a Princess, with full rites.

00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:46.520
Such a grand wedding,

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:49.040
I would have no regrets.

00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:54.160
I haven't visited the Queen Mother in days.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:55.840
I'd like to see her.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:57.720
Li Quan.

00:19:58.120 --> 00:19:58.560
Here.

00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:00.360
Escort Miss Ming to the Queen Mother.

00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:01.400
Yes.

00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:04.640
Your servant takes her leave.

00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:05.720
Miss Ming, please.

00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:22.440
Attack from the left.

00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:24.120
The pass.

00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:42.800
My father has led men around to here.

00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:44.560
But Hou Qi's men are still defending.

00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:45.960
It's hard to break through.

00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:49.240
The Pingxiang palace is easy to defend, hard to attack.

00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:51.680
That's why Hou Xian can hold out here.

00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:53.720
But their supplies are limited.

00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:55.640
They shouldn't last long.

00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:04.680
If we can lure Hou Qi into our trap

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:05.880
and redeploy some of our troops,

00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:06.840
to seize the border city,

00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:09.000
we might get a chance to defeat the enemy.

00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:12.080
That is indeed one way.

00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:14.280
But the troops left in the city are too few.

00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:16.280
I'm afraid we can't hold out for long.

00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:17.760
This really is

00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:19.240
a do-or-die battle.

00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:20.640
It's the fastest way.

00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:22.520
If we keep fighting hard,

00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:25.120
it will only give other nations

00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:26.440
a chance to rise up in rebellion.

00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:28.360
Then Ling An will face

00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:29.480
dire straits.

00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:33.040
Let's go all out.

00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:34.440
What are your chances of winning?

00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:38.920
Judging by the defenses of the Prince of Pingxiang's palace,

00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:40.440
to capture it all

00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:42.200
and redeploy troops

00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:43.560
to support the border city

00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:44.960
will take at least two days.

00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:47.760
But the border city's troops and supplies

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.000
can only last three days.

00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:50.680
We have only one chance.

00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:53.640
Alright.

00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:55.920
Since you've made up your mind,

00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:57.440
let's go all out.

00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:03.200
But the most important thing now

00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:04.760
is to make Hou Qi

00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:06.280
notice the border city's weakness.

00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:11.240
Make him think he can split his forces to take it.

00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:13.040
So he can use it as merit

00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:14.640
to atone for his crimes when he ascends.

00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:16.160
That's easy enough.

00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:18.080
I'll send people to spread the news.

00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:19.480
You arrange the surprise attack.

00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:21.920
Make it look like the city is truly weak.

00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:23.880
Act as if we desperately need supplies.

00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:28.440
Here,

00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:29.600
and here,

00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:31.720
are Hou Qi's main defense zones.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:33.360
This

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:34.760
is the supply camp.

00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:36.520
How do you know that?

00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:38.600
Could it be

00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:40.000
that in Hou Qi's residence

00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:41.560
you have your own people?

00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:44.800
I stayed at his place for a while before.

00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:46.320
Naturally, I learned a few things.

00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:54.440
I've always been curious—

00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:55.680
in just a few days,

00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:57.080
you could plant spies?

00:22:57.560 --> 00:22:58.520
How did you do it?

00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:01.320
I have my own clever plan.

00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:03.200
You handle the fighting.

00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:04.320
I'll handle the intelligence.

00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:05.720
Each trade has its own master.

00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:14.560
This spear is

00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:18.080
the Nanjia Spear.

00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:47.360
How is my mother's illness?

00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:48.720
Don't worry, Princess.

00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:50.520
The Queen Mother is just too worried.

00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:51.560
It's nothing serious.

00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:53.880
But she's always tired.

00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:55.520
Why can't she get her energy up?

00:23:55.960 --> 00:23:56.640
The Queen Mother

00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:58.160
has stayed in the palace too long

00:23:58.440 --> 00:23:59.360
and lacks exercise.

00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:01.000
That's why she feels unwell.

00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:01.960
She can

00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:03.080
walk outside the palace more

00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:04.480
and get some fresh air.

00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:05.600
That will

00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:06.880
ease her symptoms.

00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:08.520
That's good.

00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:10.200
Your servant takes leave.

00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:21.680
Mother,

00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:23.440
you know,

00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:25.920
if you come back and stay with me every day,

00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:29.120
I'll be cured of any illness.

00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:31.080
Alright, since he's not here,

00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:32.640
I'll come back and keep you company.

00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:33.920
He—

00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:35.600
Who is "he"?

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.920
Didn't you leave the palace for Rui Yu?

00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:40.760
I stopped liking him long ago.

00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:41.720
I left the palace for—

00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:42.360
Queen Mother,

00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:45.480
the medicine is ready.

00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:47.240
Thank you for your hard work.

00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:50.840
Serving the Queen Mother is my duty.

00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:55.920
Now that you're a Princess waiting to marry,

00:24:57.480 --> 00:25:00.240
I truly feel sorry for you.

00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:04.160
It's my honor to marry for our country.

00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:07.400
But I can't serve you in the palace anymore.

00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:09.600
That makes me sad.

00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:19.520
Let's talk about something happy.

00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:21.720
Yan Luo,

00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:24.760
you're also of marrying age.

00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:27.680
You used to only think of Rui Yu.

00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:29.760
Now that

00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:31.720
you've given up on him,

00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:33.280
I

00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:35.280
will arrange a marriage for you.

00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:37.280
The Left Minister's eldest legitimate grandson.

00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:38.280
Mother,

00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:40.640
I don't want to marry that Left Minister's grandson!

00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:41.880
I have someone I like.

00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:43.800
But aren't you—

00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:44.560
I...

00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:47.320
I only admired Brother Yu.

00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:49.640
After all I've been through, I realized

00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:52.440
the one I truly like

00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:55.040
is Brother Yu's second brother, Rui Wang.

00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:56.040
Rui...

00:25:56.520 --> 00:25:57.640
Rui Wang?

00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:00.800
What is his position in court?

00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:03.160
The second son Rui hasn't entered officialdom.

00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:05.200
He just travels between nations

00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:06.560
doing small business.

00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:07.960
Nonsense!

00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:10.480
You're a princess of Ling An.

00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:13.240
How can you marry a drifter?

00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:14.360
He's not—

00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:16.600
This matter

00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:18.560
is not for you to mess around with.

00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:20.360
For the next few days,

00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:22.360
stay in the palace.

00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:24.120
I'll have the Left Minister's wife

00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:25.960
bring her grandson to the palace

00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:27.080
and arrange for you to meet.

00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:27.960
I won't!

00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:28.560
Mother!

00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:29.120
Your Highness,

00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:32.120
it's been a long time since you returned.

00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:33.880
Spring Garden is beautiful right now.

00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:35.600
Won't you go take a look?

00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:36.960
Yes,

00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:39.760
you two sisters should go out for a walk.

00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:41.240
Go back now.

00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:46.840
Your child takes leave, your child takes leave.

00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:50.160
Let's go.

00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:13.200
Princess,

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:15.040
what are you looking at?

00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:21.080
Do you think the flowers and birds here

00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:23.880
are truly happy?

00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:25.760
Don't they feel trapped?

00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:29.760
Princess,

00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:31.160
come.

00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:37.600
Don't worry.

00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:39.920
Your Majesty and the Queen Mother
both care deeply for you.

00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:41.840
They would never let you suffer.

00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:44.280
Last time Qian Yuan asked for marriage,

00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:46.200
Your Majesty still refused them.

00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:48.680
If you keep holding firm this time,

00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:50.760
the Queen Mother will understand your feelings.

00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:55.880
You care so much for the Crown Prince.

00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:58.000
Was it because you didn't persist,

00:27:58.040 --> 00:27:59.600
that you had to marry into Qian Yuan?

00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:02.840
Our fate

00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:04.840
was never truly in our own hands.

00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:06.440
Even if we persist,

00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:07.680
what good does it do?

00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:10.120
But you and I are different people.

00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:13.240
Rui Wang's kindness to you

00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:14.720
is clear to all of us.

00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:16.880
If two hearts truly match,

00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:19.120
but end badly due to compromise,

00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:21.120
you'll regret it for life.

00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:25.760
But Your Majesty has no affection for me.

00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:28.120
Why should I force things?

00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:30.560
Marrying for the country

00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:33.640
is the last thing I do for him.

00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:36.720
Your Highness,

00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:38.760
you are blessed by the heavens.

00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:40.840
And you share true love with your beloved.

00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:42.720
Don't let yourself have regrets.

00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:46.440
But...

00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:48.480
What should I do?

00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:52.000
Go find him.

00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:53.360
Let the Queen Mother

00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:54.680
know your true feelings.

00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:09.720
There's a fire!

00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:11.320
Fire!

00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:13.440
The supply camp is on fire!

00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:14.560
Put out the fire! Hurry!

00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:15.720
Grab something to fight the fire!

00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:17.160
Go, go, go!

00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:18.360
Nan Chenxiao!

00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:21.400
You bastard, ambushed me!

00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:26.720
Loose the arrows!

00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:38.840
Retreat!

00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:40.920
We're surrounded!

00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:42.000
Don't panic!

00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:43.920
Watch me kill Nan Chenxiao!

00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:45.400
Seize Ling An's supplies!

00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:50.840
Little brat!

00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:52.440
Only know how to play dirty.

00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:55.200
If you dare, fight me head-on!

00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:56.320
Reporting to Prince,

00:29:56.640 --> 00:29:58.840
Ling An's troops have surrounded our rear.

00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:00.200
I'm afraid we can't win.

00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:02.680
All troops, fall back to base!

00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:03.800
Yes!

00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:05.440
Retreat!

00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:10.160
Pan Zi Zhai returned to Qian Yuan

00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:12.440
and stands as a rival to the Second Prince.

00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:15.600
He insists on negotiating with Ling An now

00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:17.520
to benefit Qian Yuan.

00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:33.120
Your Majesty,

00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:35.640
he's stationed troops outside Jiaozhou City

00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:37.040
to force Ling An to negotiate.

00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:38.200
Before this,

00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:40.280
he used the marriage alliance to mislead us.

00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:42.840
Now he suddenly breaks the treaty.

00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:43.800
This...

00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:46.880
This means he wants war with us!

00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:48.480
Your Majesty,

00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:50.280
Wu Rong and Ling An have allied.

00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:53.240
If Ling An and Wu Rong attack Qian Yuan together,

00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:54.880
they can't resist.

00:30:57.880 --> 00:30:59.720
The south is in chaos now.

00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:00.760
The people are unsettled.

00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:03.000
The north must not falter.

00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:06.040
Your servant believes

00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:08.920
Your Majesty should leave the palace to pray for blessings.

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:10.440
To calm the people's hearts.

00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:11.680
That is wise.

00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:15.840
Then I and the Ministry of Rites will confirm the ceremony today.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.800
We can go to the altar outside the city in two days.

00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:20.680
The altar outside the city

00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:24.000
is only for rain prayers and royal offerings.

00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:26.280
The late emperor set the prayer altar

00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:27.480
in the north.

00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:28.720
For Your Majesty to pray,

00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:31.200
you must go to our dynasty's roots.

00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:33.440
Only then will the heavens hear.

00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:35.360
Qian Yuan is watching us closely.

00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:36.920
Your Majesty going north

00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:38.320
is too dangerous.

00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:40.880
Ling An is a great and powerful nation.

00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:42.760
How could we fear

00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:44.640
a mere vassal state?

00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:47.480
The late emperor's rules must not be abandoned.

00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:48.920
When the ruler prays for blessings,

00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:50.320
he must go north.

00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:51.720
If so,

00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:54.000
the Ministry of Rites will draft the procedures.

00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:56.440
Hanlin Academy Second Rank Scholar Rui Yu

00:31:56.720 --> 00:31:58.040
will accompany the envoy to Qian Yuan.

00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:00.040
To show our nation's might.

00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:03.240
Your Majesty is wise.

00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:08.680
General,

00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:13.680
What's this?

00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:14.880
This is...

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:16.320
It came with the supplies.

00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:18.440
It's for Rui Wang from the Princess.

00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:20.560
The Princess asked you to give it to me?

00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:21.800
Yes.

00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:23.040
What is it?

00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:23.840
So mysterious.

00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:32.360
Princess.

00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:33.240
This...

00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:34.400
Th-this...

00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:34.920
You...

00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:35.560
This isn't me.

00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:36.040
This...

00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:37.920
Come, come.

00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:39.080
I'm starving!

00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:40.160
Quick!

00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:42.240
Get me something to eat!

00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:43.000
Princess.

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:43.840
Princess! Princess!

00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:54.760
It smells amazing!

00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:56.440
I've never thought food

00:32:56.680 --> 00:32:58.200
could taste this good.

00:32:58.960 --> 00:32:59.640
Nonsense!

00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:01.960
Why aren't you staying in the palace?

00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:03.120
Why did you come here?

00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:04.760
I...

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:10.920
I just wanted to see you.

00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:12.280
The battlefield is dangerous.

00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:14.240
With you here, we have to worry about you.

00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:14.760
How can we...

00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:15.640
I won't run around.

00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:17.200
I won't cause you trouble.

00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:19.720
I couldn't see you,

00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:21.360
and I was so worried.

00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:24.000
I'm sorry.

00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:34.680
Princess, you truly arrived at a bad time.

00:33:36.520 --> 00:33:37.360
Hou Qi's main force

00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:39.000
is already heading toward the border city.

00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:41.280
A fierce battle is about to break out soon.

00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:44.520
I'm sorry.

00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:46.440
I was too reckless.

00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:52.240
But it wasn't entirely useless.

00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:55.560
It drew Hou Qi to shift his troops.

00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:56.880
It's still far too risky.

00:33:57.280 --> 00:33:58.200
The people in the city

00:33:58.320 --> 00:33:59.640
have begun leaving to seek safety.

00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:01.240
But everyone is anxious.

00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:03.960
Princess, would you help my second brother

00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:05.560
to calm the people

00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:07.400
and escort them out of the city?

00:34:09.160 --> 00:34:11.040
Can I... am I allowed?

00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:17.760
You are the Princess of Ling An.

00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:19.000
The people

00:34:19.240 --> 00:34:20.600
will feel protected by you.

00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:23.640
They'll evacuate in an orderly way.

00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:29.320
General.

00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:31.040
The scouts have reported.

00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:33.280
Hou Qi has camped three hundred paces from the city.

00:34:36.680 --> 00:34:37.480
Understood.

00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:39.560
Rui Wang.

00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:41.520
I'll leave the people to you.

00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:43.080
Don't worry.

00:34:57.520 --> 00:34:58.080
Let's go.

00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:14.720
Miss Qiao.

00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:17.120
Master Rui.

00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:20.440
Here are the tonic herbs you requested.

00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:21.800
Thank you.

00:35:23.240 --> 00:35:24.080
I heard

00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:25.560
you're leaving for a distant place?

00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:26.840
Yes.

00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:29.480
I just received Jiaozhou City's defense map.

00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:31.840
The southern front is tense now.

00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:34.080
Qian Yuan in the north is also watching closely.

00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:37.600
Prime Minister Ming and the ministers urge Your Majesty to go north to pray.

00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:39.640
I must act as envoy

00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:41.080
and go to Qian Yuan for negotiations.

00:35:42.120 --> 00:35:43.680
The situation is so dire.

00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:45.520
Your Majesty is actually leaving Jingdu Cheng.

00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:49.200
The Late Emperor set the royal altar in the north.

00:35:49.880 --> 00:35:51.200
Ling An governs by ritual.

00:35:51.640 --> 00:35:53.280
Your Majesty must comply.

00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:00.920
Master Rui.

00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:03.320
May I trouble you with something?
