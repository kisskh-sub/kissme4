00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.439
Something just arrived
from the Princess Royal's Residence.

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:55.860
(A meeting at the Bookshop
during the Hour of Wei)

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.180
(Old Bookshop)

00:02:12.639 --> 00:02:14.590
I didn't expect
the favor Your Highness mentioned

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:17.360
to mean accompanying you
on a shopping trip.

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:18.759
Why not?

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.599
A favor from Mr. Qingya
isn't something one should turn down.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.400
As it happens,
I want to buy a painting as a gift.

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.039
You're familiar with the arts.

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.479
You can help me choose.

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:31.680
And buying it from Zhou
can count as making it up to him.

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:33.560
A gift?

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.759
May I ask who it's for, Your Highness?

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:38.520
My mother.

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:44.800
To be more precise,

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:46.439
it's for a memorial offering.

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:50.199
My mother loved calligraphy
and paintings above all else.

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:52.730
Whenever she came across a fine piece,

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:54.500
she could stay up
the entire night with it.

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:57.240
She would spare no effort
just to behold one.

00:02:57.879 --> 00:02:58.800
That year,

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.000
I promised her

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:02.759
that on her birthday,

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.500
I would give her the finest painting
in the entire capital.

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:08.400
But she was born in spring,

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:12.800
and by the time winter snow fell,
I had already left the capital.

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.080
In the end,
I never made it back in time.

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:19.199
After she passed,

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.159
her treasured paintings
disappeared as well.

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.479
If she were watching from the afterlife,

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.039
knowing her beloved collection
was treated so poorly,

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:29.599
she would be heartbroken.

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.199
At that time, I was beyond the border.

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:34.520
I could barely protect myself,

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:36.719
let alone her paintings.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:38.960
Perhaps it wasn't
as tragic as you think.

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.479
Maybe the Consort
had old acquaintances in the capital.

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:51.400
They may have taken care
of her belongings for her.

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:54.039
Is that so?

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.039
Even if you only said it
to comfort me, thank you.

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:04.990
I failed my mother in many ways.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.580
So I hope this memorial offering
can make up for it in some small part.

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:08.360
Tell me,

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:09.800
which painting is the best?

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:22.439
That one.

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.600
Though painted with only a few strokes,

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:27.399
the light ink captures
blossoms in full bloom.

00:04:27.879 --> 00:04:29.319
A gentle rain, white pear flowers.

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:31.639
It looks delicate,

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:34.759
yet it is the first to bloom
in the chill of spring.

00:04:37.519 --> 00:04:38.319
How fitting.

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.800
Pear blossoms
were my mother's favorite.

00:04:42.319 --> 00:04:43.120
I believe

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.000
she would truly love this one.

00:05:00.839 --> 00:05:01.639
Thank you, sir.

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:05.420
There is no need for thanks,
Your Highness.

00:05:05.439 --> 00:05:06.879
Demon girl, prepare to die.

00:05:14.319 --> 00:05:15.160
Leave one alive.

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:18.040
Demon girl,

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:19.519
you deserve the worst death.

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:25.900
(Old Bookshop)

00:05:27.279 --> 00:05:28.879
You're quite the devoted father.

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:30.920
To save your daughter,

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:32.560
you even take on any job offered.

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:34.120
How did you know?

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:38.319
You thought assassinating me
might solve your urgent troubles.

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:40.680
But if you die,

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:42.560
who will protect your daughter?

00:05:43.399 --> 00:05:44.240
Did you really believe

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.560
I would let her go?

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:48.800
Xiao Pingning,

00:05:49.279 --> 00:05:50.560
you monster!

00:05:51.279 --> 00:05:53.160
Why do you hate me so much?

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:54.240
Speak.

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:55.680
Ever since you returned,

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:57.639
you've been colluding with Gan Sheng.

00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:59.959
You've thrown
the entire court into chaos.

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:01.680
Everyone fears the two of you.

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:03.959
Xiao Pingning,

00:06:04.199 --> 00:06:06.759
you are utterly unworthy
of being the Princess Royal of Jing!

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:09.680
Killing you

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.480
would rid the people of a plague.

00:06:13.279 --> 00:06:14.600
I have no regrets!

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:23.519
You really do hate me to your very core.

00:06:25.839 --> 00:06:26.639
It seems

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:28.480
I can only...

00:06:29.839 --> 00:06:30.639
Your Highness.

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:36.319
Let you go.

00:06:45.319 --> 00:06:46.120
Why?

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:47.920
You despise me,

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:50.279
yet I insist you owe me your life.

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:52.959
Remember this. From this day on,

00:06:53.319 --> 00:06:55.600
I am the one who saved you.

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:58.600
Xiao Pingning, you...

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:00.680
Enough. Let him go.

00:07:00.879 --> 00:07:01.680
He's an eyesore.

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:04.079
Move.

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:15.279
Your wound needs tending.

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:16.920
I have medicine with me.

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:18.560
Forgive the intrusion.

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:46.399
Your Highness let him go.

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:50.040
That was a brilliant move.

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:56.879
You mean

00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:59.399
I was only putting on a show for you?

00:07:59.879 --> 00:08:01.439
And once you looked away,

00:08:01.519 --> 00:08:02.680
I would have him killed?

00:08:03.639 --> 00:08:04.439
Would you?

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:17.480
So that's truly how you see me.

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:19.279
After all,

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:22.399
that's what everyone
in this world believes.

00:08:22.839 --> 00:08:23.879
It's only natural.

00:08:28.399 --> 00:08:29.720
Judging from Your Highness's tone,

00:08:30.639 --> 00:08:32.279
does that mean Your Highness's decision

00:08:32.799 --> 00:08:34.039
had another reason behind it?

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:41.679
You mean letting that man go?

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:46.500
Every wrong has its perpetrator,
every debt its owner.

00:08:46.879 --> 00:08:49.080
He was nothing more
than an insignificant pawn.

00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:51.990
I, Xiao Pingning, have no interest
in making things difficult for him.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:53.799
Besides,

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:56.600
a child is innocent. Why involve him?

00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:02.840
(And were Mrs. Liu
and Zhao not innocent too?)

00:09:06.399 --> 00:09:07.399
But tell me, sir,

00:09:07.879 --> 00:09:09.399
since you truly believe

00:09:09.399 --> 00:09:11.759
I am a demon who kills without blinking,

00:09:11.919 --> 00:09:13.480
then when I was in danger just now,

00:09:13.879 --> 00:09:15.519
why did you step in to save me?

00:09:23.639 --> 00:09:24.639
It was an emergency.

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:26.360
Saving someone is instinct.

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:30.559
Even a stray cat or dog,

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.279
I would still help.

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:35.919
Let alone a living person.

00:09:40.919 --> 00:09:42.559
With a heart like yours,

00:09:42.559 --> 00:09:44.840
not becoming a living Bodhisattva
in some temple

00:09:44.879 --> 00:09:46.320
is truly a pity.

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:52.559
Still, thank you for today, sir.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.780
When I make my offering
for my mother's memorial,

00:09:54.799 --> 00:09:56.039
I will tell her about you.

00:10:40.639 --> 00:10:41.759
Heaven above,

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:45.600
I pray you

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:49.799
grant my mentor's family
peace in the afterlife

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:53.519
and guide them to the Pure Land.

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:03.000
Mr. Liu,

00:11:05.919 --> 00:11:08.080
I think I may have made a mistake.

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:12.080
Or perhaps

00:11:14.879 --> 00:11:17.200
I made that mistake a year ago.

00:11:18.519 --> 00:11:19.320
Because

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:22.759
you were the one who saved my life.

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:33.759
My play saved Xiao Pingning,

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:37.000
yet Xiao Pingning killed you.

00:11:42.159 --> 00:11:43.879
I have always understood,

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.320
that in life,

00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:50.590
no one can escape the consequences
of their actions.

00:12:02.639 --> 00:12:05.320
But I never imagined,

00:12:07.039 --> 00:12:09.480
that the retribution
would fall upon you.

00:12:11.559 --> 00:12:13.679
If a life must be exchanged for a life,

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:19.399
why couldn't the one to die be me?

00:12:30.159 --> 00:12:31.320
Perhaps

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:35.159
this is retribution indeed.

00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:40.840
Retribution for the fact that

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:44.360
I still harbored
foolish hopes about her.

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:54.080
Even today, I wavered again.

00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:58.200
I nearly believed in her.

00:13:02.919 --> 00:13:04.759
But her hands are already stained

00:13:04.759 --> 00:13:06.600
with the blood
of too many innocent people.

00:13:40.879 --> 00:13:41.919
Mr. Liu,

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:44.799
I have failed you.

00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:48.360
But rest assured,

00:13:50.679 --> 00:13:52.720
I will give everything I have,

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.399
to protect the Jing you cherished most.

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:29.720
