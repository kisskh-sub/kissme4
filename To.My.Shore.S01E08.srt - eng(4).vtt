Maybe it's his birthday.

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.679
Young man, who are you looking for?

00:02:29.679 --> 00:02:31.520
The person who lives here, You Shu Lang.

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:32.639
Xiao You, huh.

00:02:32.639 --> 00:02:34.279
He got in pretty late last night,

00:02:34.279 --> 00:02:36.039
then went out again first thing this morning.

00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:38.090
Call him.

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.609
Okay. Thank you, sir.

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:02.360
What's wrong, Xiao?

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:03.360
Feeling down?

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.679
Come on.

00:03:04.679 --> 00:03:06.360
Drink with me and let it out.

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:07.908

Shu Lang!

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:17.480
President Fan.

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:18.639
Looking for Director You?

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:20.080
He's on annual leave.

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.570
He hasn't come in these past few days.

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.800
Okay, stop. One more drink and you'll die here.

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.240
Enough already.

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:45.090
Stop drinking.

00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:56.759
Oh, it's you again, young man.

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:59.639
Have you been waiting all night for Xiao You?

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:01.759
We got into a little fight.

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:02.880
I was hot-headed,

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.720
said some harsh things.

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.119
I want to apologize in person.

00:04:06.119 --> 00:04:09.800
I saw him leave with a suitcase
a couple days ago.

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:11.639
I don't think he'll be back that soon.

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:13.880
Why don't I leave you my number?

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:15.920
If he comes back, please call me.

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:16.959
That works.

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:19.320
I know you like the hunt.

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.640
Start a new game, then.

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:24.890
Better than drinking your misery away.

00:04:28.239 --> 00:04:31.320
Are you even listening?

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.600
"Misery"?

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.689
When did you go blind?

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:37.600
Right.

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.570
I'm blind.

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.559
I can dump him,

00:04:43.559 --> 00:04:45.928
but he doesn't get to leave me.

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:48.850
He can't leave.

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:58.689
Then stop fixating on just one person.

00:04:59.359 --> 00:05:01.450
So, what's the plan?

00:05:02.559 --> 00:05:04.679
If he won't play nice,

00:05:04.679 --> 00:05:08.490
I'll coax him back, then dump him hard.

00:05:10.279 --> 00:05:12.170
By the way,

00:05:13.519 --> 00:05:16.000
we nailed the identity of that hostess.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.799
She just ran away from the mountains.

00:05:17.799 --> 00:05:21.959
Her dad previously sold her
to a rich bumpkin in his sixties.

00:05:21.959 --> 00:05:23.839
What do you plan to do about her?

00:05:23.839 --> 00:05:27.637
Give that bumpkin her phone number.

00:05:29.239 --> 00:05:30.959
That's it?

00:05:30.959 --> 00:05:32.679
Not sending her address?

00:05:32.679 --> 00:05:34.799
Just scare her.

00:05:34.799 --> 00:05:36.399
If it really blows up

00:05:36.399 --> 00:05:38.920
and You Shu Lang finds out,

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:40.480
I'll never win him back.

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:42.720
That You must've owed you in his past life

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:45.200
and is here to repay you in this one.

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:46.359
Fine, fine.

00:05:46.359 --> 00:05:49.119
Have it your way.

00:05:49.119 --> 00:05:51.040
But if he won't even look at you,

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:52.399
how are you going to coax him?

00:05:52.399 --> 00:05:54.600
He owes me?

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:57.882
Feels more like he came to save me.

00:06:01.717 --> 00:06:04.959
[Mr. Zhao: Xiao You's back today.]

00:06:04.959 --> 00:06:06.600
I've got my ways.

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:08.209
Stay out of it.

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:22.920
Director You.

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:24.720
I've got no way to clear my name.

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:26.480
If I'd done that,

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.280
why would I have sent you home afterward,

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:30.170
guarding you the whole way?

00:06:31.559 --> 00:06:34.040
That's what makes me most uncomfortable.

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:36.200
First, someone set me up.

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:38.359
Then, it was recorded
and replayed over and over.

00:06:38.359 --> 00:06:39.679
Fan Xiao.

00:06:39.679 --> 00:06:42.320
I strongly suspect you sent me home

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:45.160
just to savor how pathetic I was.

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:46.720
Once wasn't enough.

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:48.239
You kept replaying it.

00:06:48.239 --> 00:06:50.839
The clip came from the dashcam upload.

00:06:50.839 --> 00:06:53.480
I replayed because I was drawn to you.

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:55.399
You can't condemn me
based on baseless suspicion

00:06:55.399 --> 00:06:57.119
and write me off.

00:06:57.119 --> 00:07:00.800
That's not fair to me, is it?

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:08.359
Go home.

00:07:08.359 --> 00:07:09.480
When I figure things out,

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:10.839
I'll come looking for you.

00:07:10.839 --> 00:07:12.920
What if you never figure things out?

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:16.080
Answer me, what if you never do?

00:07:17.839 --> 00:07:20.600
Fan Xiao, give me some time

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:22.929
to let my emotions settle.

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:25.529
I'll come talk to you.

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:30.283
Drink less and go home.

00:07:35.519 --> 00:07:37.611
Fan Xiao, are you out of your mind?

00:07:40.239 --> 00:07:41.480
Your hand has an old injury.

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:42.720
- Let me see your hand.
- You don't want me.

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:45.249
So, why do you want my hand?

00:07:46.559 --> 00:07:48.730
Calm down, Fan Xiao.

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:51.160
I can't.

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:53.720
You can pause our relationship as you please,

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:58.320
so does that mean I can desire you as I will?

00:07:58.320 --> 00:07:59.839
Your hand is hurt, Fan Xiao.

00:07:59.839 --> 00:08:01.119
Tend to it first.

00:08:01.119 --> 00:08:03.320
Everything else can come later.

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:04.600
Don't worry.

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:07.050
Even with this hand, I can make you happy.

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:10.040
We each get to be in charge once.

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:11.969
Call it fair.

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:19.640
Fan Xiao...

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:22.363
Can I trust you?

00:08:32.719 --> 00:08:35.304
Are you willing to?

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:42.320
If you're lying to me,

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:44.280
then lie to me forever.

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:46.119
Don't slip up.

00:08:46.119 --> 00:08:48.449
Don't let me find out the truth.

00:08:50.359 --> 00:08:53.599
I may not be much,

00:08:53.599 --> 00:08:56.553
but I have my dignity.

00:08:57.280 --> 00:08:59.329
If you must lie to me,

00:09:02.819 --> 00:09:05.000
then keep lying.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.845
Don't let me find out.

00:09:08.919 --> 00:09:12.280
That's the greatest mercy I can give you.

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:14.130
Can you do that?

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:17.130
I didn't lie to you.

00:09:18.499 --> 00:09:20.926
Don't dump me.

00:09:20.926 --> 00:09:22.815
I'm not dumping you.

00:09:24.799 --> 00:09:27.080
Come back.

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:28.930
You Shu Lang.

00:09:30.159 --> 00:09:32.730
You're so cruel.

00:09:33.599 --> 00:09:35.640
You tell me to leave, and I leave.

00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:38.719
You tell me to come back, and I come back.

00:09:38.719 --> 00:09:42.093
Since when do you get to decide everything?

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:45.289
So, are you coming back?

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:48.100
I'm back.

00:09:49.559 --> 00:09:52.197
Haven't seen you in three days.

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:55.310
I missed you.

You Shu Lang.

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:02.690
I lied about many things I told you,

00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:06.373
but "I love you" was true.

00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:09.209
I love you.

00:10:10.919 --> 00:10:12.930
I love you so much.

Drop me here.

00:10:20.719 --> 00:10:22.799
If colleagues see you dropping me off,

00:10:22.799 --> 00:10:24.400
it won't look good.

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:25.520
Okay.

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:27.850
I won't hurt your reputation.

00:10:28.559 --> 00:10:31.963
I'll loop around then head to your office.

00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:34.640
I've got meetings all day.

00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:37.480
It's not great to hang around my office.

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:39.239
I'll keep you company after work.

00:10:39.239 --> 00:10:41.479
- Be good.
- Do your thing.

00:10:41.479 --> 00:10:43.520
I'll be in my own office.

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:47.679
Didn't you say that
Director Liu gave me an office?

00:10:47.679 --> 00:10:49.719
It's gathering cobwebs.

00:10:49.719 --> 00:10:52.359
Either way I'm sticking close.

00:10:52.359 --> 00:10:55.159
Gotta make up for those three days.

00:10:55.159 --> 00:10:57.413
Okay.

00:11:00.872 --> 00:11:02.919
Hold up.

00:11:02.919 --> 00:11:04.039
What?

00:11:04.039 --> 00:11:06.528
Gotta collect some sugar first.

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:15.125
We're on a public street, President Fan.

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:27.120
Today's meeting materials

have been placed on your seats,

00:11:29.159 --> 00:11:33.120
and the e-copies are in your inboxes.

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:35.760
Director Liu, the case-closing report
and the price list for that project

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:37.000
have been submitted.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.386
Xiao Ding will handle the wrap-up.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.986
Our next meeting time is...

00:11:45.039 --> 00:11:49.880
- President Fan.
- Sorry to interrupt the meeting.

00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:52.599
While reconciling quotes with Finance,

00:11:52.599 --> 00:11:54.760
there was one item I didn't understand.

00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:57.119
Could I borrow Director You for two minutes?

00:11:57.119 --> 00:11:58.119
Come to my office.

00:11:58.119 --> 00:12:00.520
President Fan, we're still in a meeting.

00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:01.960
It's fine, it's fine.

00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:03.599
Xiao You, go ahead.

00:12:03.599 --> 00:12:06.960
Let Xiao Ding handle the rest.

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:08.280
Yes, sir.

00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:10.170
I'll head over.

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:14.039
Xiao Ding, I've arranged to meet
Officer Wu from Drug Administration.

00:12:14.039 --> 00:12:15.399
Let's go together after the meeting.

00:12:15.399 --> 00:12:17.132
Got it, Director.

00:12:26.327 --> 00:12:27.977
Fan Xiao.

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:40.200
It hasn't even been two minutes.

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:42.280
Fan Xiao.

00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:43.599
What?

00:12:43.599 --> 00:12:45.960
You promised to make up for three days.

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:47.400
You stayed in the meeting room all morning.

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:48.400
Didn't come out even once.

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:50.700
I'm charging interest.

00:12:53.359 --> 00:12:54.960
You're going out this afternoon, too.

00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:56.159
Yeah.

00:12:56.159 --> 00:12:58.930
Then I'll advance the afternoon's portion, too.

00:12:59.765 --> 00:13:01.479
Tonight.

00:13:01.479 --> 00:13:02.520
Tonight, alright?

00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:04.849
You can have as much as you want.

00:13:05.933 --> 00:13:07.840
Deal.

00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:11.280
Tomorrow's the weekend.
I'm taking you somewhere.

00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:13.799
Where? Why so secretive?

00:13:13.799 --> 00:13:15.280
I've had it ready for a while.

00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:17.760
But you ignored me the last few days.

00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:19.359
All right.

00:13:19.359 --> 00:13:22.730
I'll finish all my work today.

00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:25.320
Okay.

00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:27.520
Get back to your work.

00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:29.569
I'll spend time alone outside.

00:14:10.599 --> 00:14:12.799
At the cemetery, you mentioned this.

00:14:12.799 --> 00:14:15.080
When you're busy, you might not make it back.

00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:17.239
When you miss her,

00:14:17.239 --> 00:14:19.320
you might not know where to go to pay respects.

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:22.840
So, I've been looking for a suitable place.

00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:24.479
It's quiet here.

00:14:24.479 --> 00:14:26.520
You can come anytime.

00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:28.200
And if you're swamped, don't worry.

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:30.610
There's year-round care taking and incense.

00:14:36.639 --> 00:14:38.249
Fan Xiao.

00:14:39.159 --> 00:14:40.679
Thank you.

00:14:40.679 --> 00:14:42.602
It's what I should do.

00:14:44.239 --> 00:14:47.239
If Auntie hadn't taken you in back then,

00:14:47.239 --> 00:14:50.250
how could I have
such a living Bodhisattva today?

00:14:51.919 --> 00:14:55.490
Mind your words before Bodhisattva.

00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:04.039
Go on, get back to work.

00:15:04.039 --> 00:15:05.840
I'll sit here alone for a while.

00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:07.120
Okay.

00:15:15.129 --> 00:15:16.479
Mom.

00:15:16.479 --> 00:15:19.903
Did I find the person you told me about?

00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:25.730
The one who makes this world feel not so bad?

00:15:29.599 --> 00:15:30.640
Boss.

00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:31.719
The bait you set out

00:15:31.719 --> 00:15:34.359
has been bitten by Second Young Master.

00:15:34.359 --> 00:15:36.960
Got it. He's circled around it long enough.

00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:39.200
Time he took the hook.

00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:40.599
Keep me updated on the intel.

00:15:40.599 --> 00:15:42.359
Fan Yu is cautious.

00:15:42.359 --> 00:15:44.559
Be alert.

00:15:44.559 --> 00:15:46.719
What about the old man and the eldest?

00:15:46.719 --> 00:15:48.200
Keep your eyes on them.

00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:49.840
When it's time to close the net,

00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:52.730
the more chips we hold, the better.

00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:01.039
But right now...

00:16:01.039 --> 00:16:04.404
I'm almost reluctant to go down with them.

00:16:07.919 --> 00:16:09.520
Lu.

00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:11.000
Have you decided?

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.799
Sleep with the lady boss
and you'll get the endorsement.

00:16:13.799 --> 00:16:15.640
Hell of a resource.

00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:19.320
Mr. Sha, you know this.

00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:21.559
I'm gay.

00:16:21.559 --> 00:16:23.610
I can't sleep with a woman.

00:16:24.479 --> 00:16:26.280
Can't sleep with a woman...

00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:28.640
Then why'd you volunteer to come

00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:30.960
to tonight's arrangement?

00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:32.610
I...

00:16:33.599 --> 00:16:36.039
I can accept...

00:16:36.039 --> 00:16:37.239
touching and stuff.

00:16:37.239 --> 00:16:39.209
"Touching"?

00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:51.919
Do you think they're putting
over a million into an endorsement

00:16:51.919 --> 00:16:54.080
for a couple of touches?

00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:56.520
You think you're made of gold?

00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:58.080
I'm sorry, Mr. Sha.

00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:01.359
I'll accept the company's punishment,
whatever it may be.

00:17:01.359 --> 00:17:03.050
I'm sorry.

00:17:11.959 --> 00:17:13.650
You really can't do it?

00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:16.680
I really can't.

00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:18.130
I'm sorry.

00:17:25.719 --> 00:17:29.049
You still think dear sugar-daddy Fan
has your back?

00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:31.400
Lu Zhen.

00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:34.239
You're a stray dog now.

00:17:34.239 --> 00:17:36.760
I never force anyone into this.

00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:39.920
But you agreed to this client.

00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:43.520
You'll do it whether you want to or not.

00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:45.880
Got it?

00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:47.560
Fan Xiao.

00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:49.520
Fan Xiao.

00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:52.569
Today's mess is all on you.

00:17:53.719 --> 00:17:56.000
Sha Huai An! I'll do you today!

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:57.650
Come on.

00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:03.359
Pup's grown fangs, huh?

00:18:03.359 --> 00:18:04.709
Fine.

00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:08.580
Tonight, you're doing me
whether you like it or not.

00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:11.169
Come on.

00:18:12.239 --> 00:18:13.760
How's this?

00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:15.479
Oh.

00:18:15.479 --> 00:18:18.590
These gym-built muscles
weren't for nothing, right?

00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:24.319
Don't you queens like this type?

00:18:24.319 --> 00:18:27.839
Come here. Come on.

00:18:27.839 --> 00:18:29.560
Come on.

00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:31.880
Mr. Sha, I was wrong.

00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:34.680
Right or wrong, finish first.

00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:38.959
Oh, you need extra services from me, don't you?

00:18:38.959 --> 00:18:40.000
Come on, Lu.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.199
I'll serve you.

00:18:42.199 --> 00:18:43.719
- Come on.
- I'm willing to fix this.

00:18:43.719 --> 00:18:45.400
I'll pay the penalty, Mr. Sha.

00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:48.329
I'm not short on your little penalty.

00:18:49.359 --> 00:18:51.599
Mr. Sha, give me a chance, please.

00:18:51.599 --> 00:18:52.839
I was wrong!

00:18:52.839 --> 00:18:54.239
Weren't you going to do me?

00:18:54.239 --> 00:18:55.680
- Mr. Sha, I was wrong.
- Do it.

00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:56.719
I truly know I was wrong.

00:18:56.719 --> 00:18:58.520
Mr. Sha.

00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:00.079
Mr. Sha, I was wrong.

00:19:00.079 --> 00:19:01.610
Mr. Sha.

00:19:04.319 --> 00:19:05.719
You really know you did wrong?

00:19:05.719 --> 00:19:07.000
I do.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.000
Fine.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.160
Tomorrow, you'll go apologize
to that female client.

00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:13.560
When she forgives you

00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:16.359
and agrees to renew her agreement with us,

00:19:16.359 --> 00:19:20.000
this will be over and in the past.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:21.640
Clear?

00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:23.250
Clear.

00:19:24.199 --> 00:19:26.920
- Clear.
- Then get the hell out.

00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:28.839
Thank you, Mr. Sha.

00:19:28.839 --> 00:19:30.490
Thank you.

00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:42.739
You still think dear sugar-daddy Fan
has your back?

00:19:42.739 --> 00:19:44.152
Lu Zhen.

00:19:44.152 --> 00:19:47.843
You're a stray dog now.

00:19:48.959 --> 00:19:50.160
Lu Zhen.

00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:52.319
You're no different from a withered flower

00:19:52.319 --> 00:19:56.089
or a dying cicada to me.

00:19:57.239 --> 00:19:59.280
Lu Zhen.

00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:01.130
Take care of yourself.

00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:08.130
Hey, kid. End of the line.

00:20:09.359 --> 00:20:11.839
I must've missed my stop.

00:20:11.839 --> 00:20:13.839
I should've gotten off one stop back.

00:20:13.839 --> 00:20:15.640
Can I ride back with you?

00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:16.719
This is the last stop.

00:20:16.719 --> 00:20:18.530
Can't go back.

00:20:23.359 --> 00:20:25.730
Can't go back?

00:20:26.959 --> 00:20:28.920
Right, we can't.

00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:31.370
Nothing can.

00:20:32.239 --> 00:20:35.319
Fan Xiao's a pervert.

00:20:35.319 --> 00:20:36.600
And I...

00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:39.049
I'm no saint either.

00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:42.040
Was it vanity

00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:44.880
or the thrill of something new?

00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:49.969
In the end, my greed cost me good Uncle You.

00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:54.199
He's found a new love.

00:20:54.199 --> 00:20:56.000
And me...

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.689
I'm just a flower, a cicada.

00:21:00.719 --> 00:21:03.250
I'm a ridiculous clown.

00:21:04.839 --> 00:21:08.280
I didn't deserve someone as good as him.

00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:10.199
Now that I think about it,

00:21:10.199 --> 00:21:13.920
when he sat alone smoking on the balcony,

00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:16.119
he must've suffered so much pain.

00:21:16.119 --> 00:21:19.199
I never tried to understand.

00:21:19.199 --> 00:21:23.160
I just took his kindness for granted.

00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:25.130
And in the end...

00:21:30.319 --> 00:21:32.650
This is... You Shu Lang's home.

00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:36.169
How did I end up here?

00:21:39.219 --> 00:21:41.110
Open up.

00:21:42.359 --> 00:21:43.839
You Shu Lang!

00:21:43.839 --> 00:21:45.040
It's me!

00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:47.239
Open up, You Shu Lang!

00:21:47.239 --> 00:21:49.319
Open the door.

00:21:49.319 --> 00:21:51.530
Open up!

00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:57.169
Uncle You, I...

00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:03.329
Fan Xiao, what are you doing here?

00:22:10.199 --> 00:22:12.160
Fan Xiao. Someone's knocking.

00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:14.160
Leave it. Focus.

00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:16.719
Fan Xiao, maybe a neighbor needs help.

00:22:16.719 --> 00:22:18.839
I'll check.

00:22:18.839 --> 00:22:22.089
Don't move, I'll answer.

00:22:29.119 --> 00:22:31.089
Open up!

00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:36.770
Uncle You, I...

00:22:42.719 --> 00:22:44.637
What are you doing here?

00:22:51.839 --> 00:22:53.319
If you've got a problem, come at me.

00:22:53.319 --> 00:22:55.569
What do you want with You Shu Lang?

00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:58.560
I already returned the gifts you gave me.

00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:01.040
And I wrote an IOU for what I owe.

00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:02.199
What do you want?

00:23:02.199 --> 00:23:04.719
We're already broken up.

00:23:04.719 --> 00:23:06.880
Lu Zhen.

00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:09.049
How does he know Fan Xiao?

00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:15.520
The photo frame's broken.

00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:17.329
Bad luck.

00:23:18.239 --> 00:23:20.076
Buddha bless.

00:23:22.359 --> 00:23:24.239
Zhen Zhen.

00:23:24.239 --> 00:23:26.680
What brings you here?

00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:28.569
Uncle You.

00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:31.280
What's going on?

00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:32.759
What are you two doing?

00:23:32.759 --> 00:23:35.000
Why is Fan Xiao in your home?

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:36.920
Yeah, Shu Lang.

00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:40.920
Why would my life model
knock on your door at midnight?

00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:42.650
You two know each other?

00:23:45.479 --> 00:23:47.479
- We...
- We do.

00:23:47.479 --> 00:23:51.650
I once hired him as my model and...

00:23:52.479 --> 00:23:54.079
It was just once.

00:23:54.079 --> 00:23:55.730
I think it was once.

00:23:56.479 --> 00:23:58.599
That's my impression.

00:23:58.599 --> 00:24:00.520
I've invited too many models.

00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:02.510
It's hard to remember.

00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:05.770
Fan Xiao, your back...

00:24:08.706 --> 00:24:10.640
You Shu Lang.

00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:12.479
What were you two doing just now?

00:24:12.479 --> 00:24:14.449
Sleeping together?

00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:20.929
Was he also the one who came out
of your bedroom last time?

00:24:22.719 --> 00:24:24.319
Yes.

00:24:24.319 --> 00:24:26.010
Yes?

00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:28.329
You Shu Lang.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.079
Do you know who he is?

00:24:32.079 --> 00:24:34.160
He's Fan Xiao.

00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:35.280
The one who hired me as a model.

00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:36.719
He called me "Zhen Zhen,"

00:24:36.719 --> 00:24:37.760
kept showering me with gifts,

00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:40.079
and showed me tenderness.

00:24:40.079 --> 00:24:43.056
He's the one who made me dump you
and cheat with him!

00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:51.250
There was no cheating.

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:55.199
Cheating requires mutual feelings.

00:24:55.199 --> 00:24:57.560
Between us...

00:24:57.560 --> 00:24:59.141
there's none of that.

00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:04.280
Right.

00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:05.520
None of that.

00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:09.319
You only pretended,
made me think you loved me.

00:25:09.319 --> 00:25:12.199
When I burned every bridge for you,

00:25:12.199 --> 00:25:14.890
you told me it was all fake.

00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:17.479
You played me, fine.

00:25:17.479 --> 00:25:19.920
I deserved it.

00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:21.640
But what are you doing here?

00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:24.370
Pervert, what do you want?

00:25:27.599 --> 00:25:28.800
I get it.

00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:32.400
Your ex is my current boyfriend.

00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:33.903
Right?

00:25:37.119 --> 00:25:39.359
All because I once turned you down,

00:25:39.359 --> 00:25:42.560
and now I'm with the boyfriend you abandoned,

00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:47.089
so you snapped?

00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:50.079
It's not like that.

00:25:50.079 --> 00:25:51.770
That's not true.

00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:53.959
It's not like that, Uncle You.

00:25:53.959 --> 00:25:56.119
Don't listen to him.

00:25:56.119 --> 00:25:58.119
It's my fault. I was base.

00:25:58.119 --> 00:25:59.800
I shouldn't have left you for him.

00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:01.560
But he's a pervert.

00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:03.160
A master manipulator.

00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:04.520
I don't know why he played me

00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:06.199
and now came for you.

00:26:06.199 --> 00:26:08.239
There must be a connection.

00:26:08.239 --> 00:26:10.071
There must be.

00:26:15.239 --> 00:26:17.640
- There must be.
- Lu Zhen.

00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:19.650
Calm down.

00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:29.880
Speak slowly.

00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:31.530
Don't get worked up.

00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:41.160
Zhen Zhen, sit. Slow your breathing.

00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:43.520
Once you calm down,

00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:44.839
we can resolve our differences.

00:26:44.839 --> 00:26:47.130
Don't call me that!

00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:50.400
Lu Zhen, sit.

00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:52.040
Eat the chocolate.

00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:53.920
Your lips are pale.

00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:56.160
It's low blood sugar.

00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:58.280
Control your emotions.

00:26:58.280 --> 00:27:01.280
I don't want you fainting here,

00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:04.689
because I no longer have
any duty to care for you.

00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:11.479
Fan Xiao.

00:27:11.479 --> 00:27:13.040
Lu Zhen's anemic.

00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:15.640
He can't take verbal stress.

00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:17.119
If your taunts today

00:27:17.119 --> 00:27:19.680
make him pass out here,

00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:22.560
the responsibility
of looking after him falls on you.

00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:24.169
After all...

00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:28.530
he was your life model once.

00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:35.610
I'm going to change.

00:27:38.119 --> 00:27:41.169
You're wrapped up tight.
Why are you changing?

00:28:00.425 --> 00:28:02.876
Lust blinds judgment.

00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:07.010
It's all self-deception.

00:29:07.812 --> 00:29:09.623
Put your clothes on.

00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:26.199
I have several questions.

00:29:26.199 --> 00:29:28.399
You can choose not to answer.

00:29:28.399 --> 00:29:31.040
But if you won't,

00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:33.880
please leave my home.

00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:34.839
Ask away, Uncle You.

00:29:34.839 --> 00:29:36.079
"Uncle" my ass.

00:29:36.079 --> 00:29:37.599
You're not three.

00:29:37.599 --> 00:29:38.719
Enough with the "uncle."

00:29:38.719 --> 00:29:40.119
Change what you call me.

00:29:40.119 --> 00:29:41.959
It's not appropriate.

00:29:41.959 --> 00:29:43.160
Lu Zhen.

00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:45.839
How did Fan Xiao find you as a model?

00:29:45.839 --> 00:29:47.479
Ms. Xiao Ya called me.

00:29:47.479 --> 00:29:48.839
I didn't want to go.

00:29:48.839 --> 00:29:51.479
I had other gigs.

00:29:51.479 --> 00:29:53.079
She told me to drop them

00:29:53.079 --> 00:29:54.319
because this one paid a lot.

00:29:54.319 --> 00:29:55.920
He asked for you by name?

00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:58.160
Yes, he specifically asked for me.

00:29:58.160 --> 00:30:00.760
Fan Xiao, did you give Lu Zhen gifts?

00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:02.400
I did.

00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:04.959
Just to thank him.

00:30:04.959 --> 00:30:06.959
Small things.

00:30:06.959 --> 00:30:08.319
Nothing expensive.

00:30:08.319 --> 00:30:11.400
The crown was from you too?

00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:13.319
I gave it.

00:30:13.319 --> 00:30:16.160
At their ad shoot,

00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:18.689
I happened to see him get bullied.

00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:21.280
We're friends.

00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:23.359
I couldn't just watch.

00:30:23.359 --> 00:30:24.920
You know how it is.

00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:26.880
Favors for favors.

00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:29.959
I had the host send him the crown.

00:30:29.959 --> 00:30:33.239
That day, Lu Zhen came to pick up the painting.

00:30:33.239 --> 00:30:35.689
You heard his voice from the room.

00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:39.239
Didn't you recognize your friend was here?

00:30:39.239 --> 00:30:41.049
I didn't recognize his voice.

00:30:42.959 --> 00:30:44.610
Lu Zhen.

00:30:45.319 --> 00:30:47.599
The day you picked up the painting,

00:30:47.599 --> 00:30:49.809
you got a call.

00:30:50.479 --> 00:30:52.079
From whom?

00:30:52.079 --> 00:30:53.239
A call?

00:30:53.239 --> 00:30:55.199
Yes.

00:30:55.199 --> 00:30:57.719
When you learned I had a new boyfriend,

00:30:57.719 --> 00:31:00.119
you looked down.

00:31:00.119 --> 00:31:02.400
But after that call,

00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:04.479
your mood lifted.

00:31:04.479 --> 00:31:07.160
So, I guessed it was your new lover.

00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:08.520
Right. I remember.

00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:09.800
It was Fan Xiao.

00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:11.719
I thought he was asking me out,
so I rushed off.

00:31:11.719 --> 00:31:13.000
I truly don't recall.

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:16.319
Lu Zhen, did I get through then?

00:31:16.319 --> 00:31:18.599
No, it ended right away.

00:31:18.599 --> 00:31:20.079
Then I must've pocket-dialed.

00:31:20.079 --> 00:31:21.119
An accident.

00:31:21.119 --> 00:31:22.920
You're lying, Fan Xiao.

00:31:22.920 --> 00:31:24.920
"Small gifts."

00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:26.560
"Just helping me out."

00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:29.160
I can tell normal kindness from flirtation.

00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:30.719
Seems you're still at the daydreaming age.

00:31:30.719 --> 00:31:32.069
Enough.

00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:37.719
When did you last meet?

00:31:37.719 --> 00:31:39.095
Long ago.

00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:41.960
It's been at least three months.

00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:44.160
I even turned down work to see him.

00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:47.160
He kept saying he was out of town.

00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:51.280
Out of town, three months ago.

00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:55.599
What's Lu Zhen's name in your contacts?

00:31:55.599 --> 00:31:57.719
"Lu," in pinyin?

00:31:57.719 --> 00:32:02.890
After the airport,
you received a call from "Lu."

00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:06.400
You had me hold it while you answered.

00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:08.689
Right in front of me.

00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:12.370
Picking up my ex's call.

00:32:13.359 --> 00:32:15.520
Was it exciting?

00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:17.770
I can show you my phone.

00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:30.929
Lu Zhen, call Fan Xiao.

00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:34.199
Okay.

00:32:34.199 --> 00:32:35.640
Shu Lang.

00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:37.160
You still don't trust me.

00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:40.400
Not with Xue Bao Tian, nor now.

00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:41.959
Am I unworthy,

00:32:41.959 --> 00:32:43.800
or are you addicted to paranoia?

00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:45.770
Are you suffering delusions?

00:32:49.902 --> 00:32:52.119
[Hua Model 1]

00:32:52.119 --> 00:32:53.770
What...

00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:23.809
Do you know what I saved you as?

00:33:31.199 --> 00:33:33.169
Look closely.

00:33:35.199 --> 00:33:37.490
"Light."

00:33:42.362 --> 00:33:46.040
[Light]

00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:48.556
Coax him back, then dump him hard?

00:33:48.556 --> 00:33:49.719
Fan Xiao.

00:33:49.719 --> 00:33:52.479
How will you dump You Shu Lang hard?

00:33:52.479 --> 00:33:54.640
Tell him everything you did,

00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:57.760
then say you never liked him?

00:33:57.760 --> 00:33:59.730
Of course not.

00:34:00.719 --> 00:34:04.280
A man as strong as You...

00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:07.280
If he knows you never loved him,

00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:09.760
he'll never spare you a thought.

00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:12.360
Only if he repents,

00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:15.000
feels he wronged you,

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:19.360
sees the one he loves suffer
from his suspicion in great pain...

00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:21.399
Then he'll feel it.

00:34:21.399 --> 00:34:23.280
Only then...

00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:26.679
will he never forget, trapped in guilt.

00:34:26.679 --> 00:34:31.320
That is how you dump him hard.

00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:33.130
You Shu Lang.

00:34:34.386 --> 00:34:36.915
You know I don't love the light.

00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:39.809
But I love you.

00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:45.729
I made you the light that drives out
darkness in my life.

00:34:46.639 --> 00:34:49.560
I treated you as redemption.

00:34:49.560 --> 00:34:51.769
As a god.

00:34:52.399 --> 00:34:54.610
But in the end,

00:34:55.479 --> 00:34:58.210
you never trusted me.

00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:01.606
Perhaps...

00:35:04.679 --> 00:35:07.719
you never loved me either.

00:35:07.719 --> 00:35:09.679
When I...

00:35:09.679 --> 00:35:13.360
When I was ready to make you my one and only,

00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:16.399
you kept searching for proof I'd lied.

00:35:16.399 --> 00:35:18.970
So-called evidence.

00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:27.769
You kept yourself ready to walk away.

00:35:30.365 --> 00:35:32.800
I love you,

00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:35.479
but I'm tired.

00:35:35.479 --> 00:35:39.360
I'm done with your cross-examinations,

00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:42.000
judged like a criminal.

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.970
I can kneel at your feet.

00:35:45.959 --> 00:35:49.130
But not as a sinner.

00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:07.049
Let's...

00:36:09.080 --> 00:36:11.317
break up.

00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:21.600
You won, Fan Xiao.

00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:24.320
You beat that fool,

00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:26.450
that Bodhisattva,

00:36:27.159 --> 00:36:31.399
that good man blind to suffering,

00:36:31.399 --> 00:36:35.170
that liar who peddles hope.

00:36:36.239 --> 00:36:38.210
Call me back, Shu Lang. Quick.

00:36:39.040 --> 00:36:41.280
Please call me back.

00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:44.560
I really want to turn around
and see his expression.

00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:46.639
I bet he looks awful.

00:36:46.639 --> 00:36:48.800
Shu Lang.

00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:51.329
I'm sinking.

00:36:53.560 --> 00:36:55.239
Save me, please.

00:36:55.239 --> 00:36:57.719
I beg you.

00:36:57.719 --> 00:37:00.600
Cheer up, Fan Xiao.

00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:03.410
You should be happy.

00:37:04.919 --> 00:37:07.170
I don't want to leave.

00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:10.370
I don't want to go.

00:37:12.120 --> 00:37:15.170
I don't want to leave.

00:37:15.919 --> 00:37:18.249
I don't want to go.

00:37:19.879 --> 00:37:22.120
I don't want to leave.

00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:23.120
President Fan.

00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:25.314
What a performance.

00:37:26.919 --> 00:37:29.172
A bit over the top.

00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:35.970
Shu Lang.

00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:38.930
What do you mean?

00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:43.329
I mean...

00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:47.009
You're a good actor,

00:37:48.159 --> 00:37:50.479
but not good enough

00:37:50.479 --> 00:37:54.000
to move the audience or the jury.

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:55.650
Shu Lang.

00:37:56.760 --> 00:37:58.479
Spell it out.

00:37:58.479 --> 00:38:01.489
You're not the passive-aggressive type.

00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:07.600
I'm really not.

00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:10.089
So, I'll be blunt.

00:38:13.040 --> 00:38:16.249
Open the first message on your phone.

00:38:32.944 --> 00:38:35.199
[You Shu Lang]

00:38:35.199 --> 00:38:37.040
What's the matter with You Shu Lang?

00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:40.040
Spit it out. Why so cryptic?

00:38:40.040 --> 00:38:42.199
Did you really pull it off?

00:38:42.199 --> 00:38:43.840
You dumped him?

00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:44.879
How'd you do it?

00:38:44.879 --> 00:38:47.479
Did you get that "dump him hard" effect?

00:38:47.479 --> 00:38:48.800
What's his current state?

00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:50.250
Is he losing his mind?

00:38:50.250 --> 00:38:53.840
Damn, I'd love to see it.

00:38:53.840 --> 00:38:57.000
You know, couldn't you have
dumped him in front of me?

00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:58.520
What reason did you use?

00:38:58.520 --> 00:39:02.399
By the way, I think you should
knock that Xue Bao Tian around.

00:39:02.399 --> 00:39:03.479
I'm afraid he'll spill.

00:39:03.479 --> 00:39:05.399
Hey, say something! Why pop up and vanish?

00:39:05.399 --> 00:39:07.639
You're getting more twisted, Young Master Fan.

00:39:07.639 --> 00:39:09.159
He'll even take someone he hates to bed.

00:39:09.159 --> 00:39:10.239
Have his fun, then dump.

00:39:10.239 --> 00:39:12.159
Twisted to the core. Pervert of perverts.

00:39:12.159 --> 00:39:14.080
Pervert to the bone.

00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:15.120
Guess I learned a new trick.

00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:16.159
Fun, right?

00:39:16.159 --> 00:39:17.239
Come out and hang out with us.

00:39:17.239 --> 00:39:19.080
I'll throw you a party.

00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:21.210
Hello? At least explain yourself.

00:39:28.500 --> 00:39:31.469
Mr. Shi is more honest than you.

00:39:32.919 --> 00:39:34.959
Sorry.

00:39:34.959 --> 00:39:37.210
I peeked at your phone.

00:39:39.080 --> 00:39:41.760
You gave me the passcode.

00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:43.919
Back at the airport.

00:39:43.919 --> 00:39:45.320
When dragging a suitcase made it inconvenient

00:39:45.320 --> 00:39:47.890
to answer Lu Zhen's call.

00:39:49.159 --> 00:39:51.210
In hindsight,

00:39:52.280 --> 00:39:54.569
it wasn't inconvenient.

00:39:55.679 --> 00:39:57.800
You wanted me to answer

00:39:57.800 --> 00:39:58.840
and hold it to your ear.

00:39:58.840 --> 00:40:01.370
It's more of a thrill, right?

00:40:02.080 --> 00:40:04.199
Right in front of me...

00:40:04.199 --> 00:40:06.719
You asked my ex to dinner,

00:40:06.719 --> 00:40:09.970
played the both of us,

00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:13.479
satisfying that unique perversion.

00:40:13.479 --> 00:40:15.120
No.

00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:17.719
I can explain.

00:40:17.719 --> 00:40:19.520
Explain.

00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:20.764
I'm listening.

00:40:20.764 --> 00:40:25.119
Shi Li Hua is talking nonsense.

00:40:25.119 --> 00:40:26.243
He...

00:40:26.243 --> 00:40:29.520
So, you had Xue Bao Tian set me up,

00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:31.239
and deliberately lured Lu Zhen.

00:40:31.239 --> 00:40:33.329
You made us break up.

00:40:35.159 --> 00:40:38.919
You never had a shred of sincerity.

00:40:38.919 --> 00:40:40.120
Now, you want to dump me hard

00:40:40.120 --> 00:40:41.479
and end your game?

00:40:41.479 --> 00:40:44.210
All Shi Li Hua's nonsense, huh?

00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:49.699
Stay silent and I'll take it as yes.

00:40:52.199 --> 00:40:53.850
Fan Xiao.

00:40:55.959 --> 00:40:59.489
What did I ever do to wrong you

00:41:00.919 --> 00:41:03.170
to earn this hatred?

00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:14.360
I believe I never did anything to hurt you.

00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:16.959
I put you first in everything,

00:41:16.959 --> 00:41:19.450
thought of you in all things.

00:41:20.360 --> 00:41:23.199
So, why?

00:41:23.199 --> 00:41:26.040
Why do you hate me this much?

00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:27.970
I don't hate you.

00:41:30.199 --> 00:41:32.047
I don't.

00:41:34.679 --> 00:41:36.249
Oh, right.

00:41:39.239 --> 00:41:42.479
I'll quote Mr. Shi.

00:41:42.479 --> 00:41:44.370
"Disgust."

00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:48.809
"Disgust."

00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:52.399
Fan Xiao.

00:41:52.399 --> 00:41:55.312
Look at how stupid I am.

00:41:55.312 --> 00:41:59.243
I thought you loved me.

00:42:02.719 --> 00:42:05.146
I take it back.

00:42:06.679 --> 00:42:09.879
You're indeed a terrific actor.

00:42:09.879 --> 00:42:12.879
So damned good.

00:42:12.879 --> 00:42:15.080
You can feign true love

00:42:15.080 --> 00:42:18.199
for someone you despise.

00:42:18.199 --> 00:42:20.210
I didn't lie.

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:23.370
My love for you is real.

00:42:24.399 --> 00:42:25.879
I didn't lie to you.

00:42:25.879 --> 00:42:29.170
I didn't, believe me.

00:42:37.959 --> 00:42:39.890
"Love me"?

00:42:41.080 --> 00:42:47.171
That's the funniest joke I've ever heard.

00:42:55.120 --> 00:42:56.890
Fan Xiao.

00:42:58.199 --> 00:43:01.080
Didn't get enough of playing me?

00:43:01.080 --> 00:43:06.850
Want to trick me back into your bed...

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:12.850
and dump me again after you've had your fun?

00:43:20.286 --> 00:43:22.036
I'll treat this past year

00:43:23.199 --> 00:43:26.450
as a filthy nightmare.

00:43:30.239 --> 00:43:34.410
Do me a favor, never appear in my life again.

00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:38.930
Never.

00:43:39.799 --> 00:43:41.280
Shu Lang.

00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:43.520
I didn't...

00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:45.170
Fuck off!
