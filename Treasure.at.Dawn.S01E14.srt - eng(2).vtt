00:30:38.750 --> 00:30:40.640
I'll show you around.

00:30:41.030 --> 00:30:41.710
This is where

00:30:42.230 --> 00:30:43.640
I fill prescriptions.

00:30:44.510 --> 00:30:45.840
My bedroom is in that direction.

00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:46.840
I sleep there.

00:30:47.510 --> 00:30:50.160
Close the curtains, and this is the operating room.

00:30:50.270 --> 00:30:51.180
It's for surgery.

00:30:53.710 --> 00:30:54.960
What are you trying to say?

00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:56.790
You don't have to beat around the bush.

00:30:59.120 --> 00:30:59.920
Is it that obvious?

00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:00.880
Say it.

00:31:03.550 --> 00:31:04.790
Actually, I want you

00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:06.230
to help me

00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:09.160
find the blacksmith who made your knife.

00:31:13.310 --> 00:31:14.510
Why didn't you just say it?

00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:17.740
Gu Tian told me

00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:19.440
it would bring me closer to my friends.

00:31:19.750 --> 00:31:21.230
I'm afraid you'll refuse to help me.

00:31:23.310 --> 00:31:24.550
The blacksmith from Ma Gang

00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:26.530
stopped making normal weapons a long time ago.

00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:28.020
This knife

00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:29.920
was the last weapon he made.

00:31:30.310 --> 00:31:32.440
He agreed to make it for me

00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:33.770
because we were both in Ma Gang.

00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:35.600
So,

00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:37.200
I can't help you.

00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:40.400
I know.

00:31:40.790 --> 00:31:42.720
All of Gu Tian's talk is nonsense.

00:31:44.030 --> 00:31:45.270
There is a girl.

00:31:46.230 --> 00:31:47.310
She's pretty.

00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:52.310
Fu Sheng, you're not a loyal friend.

00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:54.510
I talked to you for a long time

00:31:55.270 --> 00:31:56.620
before you let me into this room.

00:31:57.350 --> 00:31:59.070
Now, you took a pretty girl here

00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:00.520
the first time you met her.

00:32:01.630 --> 00:32:02.940
Are you going

00:32:03.150 --> 00:32:04.560
to show her your bedroom?

00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:05.870
Yeah.

00:32:06.110 --> 00:32:07.720
I specially cleaned up my bedroom.

00:32:09.550 --> 00:32:10.110
Do you want to take a look?

00:32:10.830 --> 00:32:11.350
No, thanks.

00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:12.910
I'll wait for you

00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:14.630
in the front lobby.

00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:20.350
Did I

00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:21.280
say the wrong thing again?

00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:21.760
No.

00:32:22.870 --> 00:32:24.240
You did very well.

00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:24.830

00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:36.040
Why didn't you let us hit them?

00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:37.680
They had more people.

00:32:37.790 --> 00:32:39.040
But they were no match for us.

00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:39.960
Are you stupid?

00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:41.720
If we had hit them, it would...

00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:43.390
It would have proved that I really had kidney deficiency.

00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:46.680
Don't worry.

00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:48.680
I'll get back at them.

Are you here to see a doctor?

This is where the people see a doctor.

Don't mess around.

You sent someone to get the medicine this morning.

00:33:33.310 --> 00:33:34.150
What's wrong? Doesn't the medicine work?

00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:35.450
It's not about the medicine.

00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:37.600
Give me your arm.

00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:46.720
Good. You know what not to do.

Nothing.

00:33:55.870 --> 00:33:57.230
I'm going to the Inviting Moon House to have a drink.

I don't want to hear any more people talking about me behind my back.

What is he doing here?

00:34:38.590 --> 00:34:39.360
Do you remember

00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:40.590
that Yingying told us

00:34:40.710 --> 00:34:42.030
she would ask the Hearsay-capturing Pavilion

00:34:42.270 --> 00:34:44.920
to look for the Mountain-shaped Jade and the Water-shaped Jade for us?

00:34:47.270 --> 00:34:47.800
He found them?

00:34:48.590 --> 00:34:50.920
We have three thousand detectives.

00:34:52.230 --> 00:34:54.190
It's just two pieces of jade.

00:34:55.630 --> 00:34:56.630
It's easy.

00:34:58.040 --> 00:34:58.840
They're awesome.

00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:00.520
You don't have to do that.

He's so serious.

00:35:23.190 --> 00:35:23.800
He's not like you.

00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:01.710
I don't know about Her Excellency.

00:40:02.630 --> 00:40:03.800
She didn't tell me that.

00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:05.230
What else do you know?

00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:07.710
I followed Chairman Song for a long time.

00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:09.840
I know

00:40:10.190 --> 00:40:11.400
what he was looking for.

00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:13.840
I've been secretly looking into it too.

00:40:15.800 --> 00:40:16.440
Only I

00:40:17.670 --> 00:40:19.480
can give you the jade plate you want.

00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:22.800
What do you want?

00:40:28.590 --> 00:40:29.110
I know

00:40:30.710 --> 00:40:31.480
you and your people

00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:35.190
want more than Xichuan.

00:40:36.670 --> 00:40:37.480
After you succeed,

00:40:39.590 --> 00:40:41.270
I want you to give me Xichuan.

00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:46.210
I'll give you a month.

00:40:46.790 --> 00:40:48.860
If you can't give me what I want,

00:40:49.350 --> 00:40:50.700
you should go to a temple

00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:53.520
and ask the bodhisattva to bless you for dying quickly.

00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:18.480
I told you

00:41:19.530 --> 00:41:22.800
that the rumors were all nonsense.

00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:26.710
Not to mention two,

00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:32.190
even twenty or two hundred,

00:41:37.710 --> 00:41:40.270
I can make them comfortable.

00:41:41.070 --> 00:41:42.750
Mr. Xubu, you've always been good.

00:41:43.270 --> 00:41:43.960
I admire you.

00:41:44.360 --> 00:41:46.270
Here comes the carriage. Mr. Xubu, be careful.

00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:49.670
Don't help me.

00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:51.270
I'm not drunk.

00:41:51.510 --> 00:41:53.880
Get away. Don't help me.

00:41:54.360 --> 00:41:55.150
I'm not drunk.

00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:08.440
I didn't drink much.

00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:11.550
Why

00:42:12.360 --> 00:42:13.360
am I drunk?

00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:26.270
Are you scared?

00:42:28.130 --> 00:42:28.860
Dude.

00:42:29.650 --> 00:42:30.780
I'm not bragging.

00:42:31.490 --> 00:42:32.320
I'm one

00:42:32.970 --> 00:42:34.190
of the three boldest people

00:42:34.530 --> 00:42:35.990
in our Chamber of Commerce.

00:42:36.370 --> 00:42:37.200
Really?

00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:39.420
Why did you ask me to accompany you to the toilet?

00:42:42.610 --> 00:42:43.520
Dude.

00:42:44.650 --> 00:42:45.780
I'll tell you a story.

00:42:47.130 --> 00:42:47.920
It happened

00:42:48.690 --> 00:42:50.360
twenty years ago.

00:42:51.130 --> 00:42:51.840
It was

00:42:52.290 --> 00:42:53.390
also a night.

00:42:53.610 --> 00:42:54.920
There was wind and rain,

00:42:55.730 --> 00:42:56.920
lightning and thunder.

00:42:57.960 --> 00:43:00.000
A woman with disheveled hair

00:43:01.810 --> 00:43:03.480
hanged herself in front of our Chamber of Commerce.

00:43:05.400 --> 00:43:06.400
No one dared

00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:08.890
to touch her.

00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:11.440
I

00:43:12.770 --> 00:43:15.110
put that woman down.

00:43:17.110 --> 00:43:19.720
Her body was left at the door for three days.

00:43:20.210 --> 00:43:21.560
Nobody dared to collect her.

00:43:22.120 --> 00:43:22.850
In those days,

00:43:23.770 --> 00:43:26.810
we could hear a woman crying every night.

00:43:28.210 --> 00:43:30.370
Later, a storyteller passed by

00:43:30.920 --> 00:43:32.560
and buried her body.

00:43:33.570 --> 00:43:35.210
Guess what?

00:43:35.660 --> 00:43:36.400
What?

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:39.140
Today,

00:43:39.650 --> 00:43:41.740
I saw that the storyteller appeared

00:43:41.770 --> 00:43:42.810
at the Inviting Moon House.

00:43:46.920 --> 00:43:48.000
What's wrong, bro?

00:43:49.690 --> 00:43:51.440
Bro, look.

00:44:27.290 --> 00:44:28.810
It sounds like a woman is crying.

00:44:29.920 --> 00:44:30.560
Don't be ridiculous.

00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:32.170
It's raining heavily. No one would come.

00:44:32.210 --> 00:44:33.480
I heard it, bro.

00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:34.730
Listen.

00:44:36.850 --> 00:44:38.170
It's coming from that carriage.

00:44:41.290 --> 00:44:42.120
It's coming from that carriage.

00:44:44.850 --> 00:44:46.400
Let's go.

00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:48.690
Go.
