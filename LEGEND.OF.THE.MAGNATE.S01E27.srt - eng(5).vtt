It must be

00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:14.030
But I have to help her too.

00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:17.150
I just feel uneasy.

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:22.480
Uneasy?

00:12:26.510 --> 00:12:28.030
She is meticulous.

00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:31.070
If there are problems you can't solve,

00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:32.790
tell me.

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:35.240
She said some

00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:36.630
baffling things.

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:40.450
I can't figure them out.

00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:41.600
Like what?

00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:46.550
She said that you gained

00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:48.030
the upper hand every time,

00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:50.790
yet you intentionally left Gu Pingyuan

00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:51.870
a way out.

00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:54.600
She said there is more to it.

00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:00.000
There is more to it?

00:13:02.530 --> 00:13:03.670
What do you think?

00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:06.440
I don't know.

00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:12.130
You only go all out for a worthy opponent.

00:13:13.510 --> 00:13:14.510
He isn't worth it.

00:13:15.270 --> 00:13:17.030
I can't let the tea trade of one province

00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:18.160
ruin my grand plans.

00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:20.210
Do you understand?

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.260
I understand, Father.

00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:26.410
Every choice has trade-offs.

00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:27.750
Business is the same.

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:31.390
This time, I'm staking all my connections

00:13:31.390 --> 00:13:32.750
and assets.

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:35.390
Once we secure the Jiangnan salt trade,

00:13:35.390 --> 00:13:36.590
you can show the world

00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:38.870
what you can do.

00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:41.600
To win this battle,

00:13:42.270 --> 00:13:43.440
I'd even kneel.

00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:46.670
What does admitting defeat matter?

00:13:48.630 --> 00:13:49.890
I understand, Father.

00:13:52.950 --> 00:13:56.710
[Pingyao, Shanxi]

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:36.720
It's you.

00:14:37.510 --> 00:14:38.840
What are you doing here?

00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:41.610
I'd like to meet Mr. Chang.

00:14:46.510 --> 00:14:47.440
What do you want?

00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:49.240
Why are you so annoying?

00:14:49.510 --> 00:14:50.150
Who is it?

00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:52.840
A beggar!

00:14:54.670 --> 00:14:55.870
Gu Pingyuan, let's get this straight.

00:14:55.870 --> 00:14:57.900
I heard you got rich
and became an official.

00:14:57.900 --> 00:14:59.080
You're proud of yourself,

00:14:59.080 --> 00:14:59.840
aren't you?

00:15:00.950 --> 00:15:02.330
I know why you're here.

00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:03.720
If you leave now,

00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:04.600
I, Heizi, will

00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:06.120
kowtow to you 100 times.

00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:07.080
Okay?

00:15:07.510 --> 00:15:08.910
I'm begging you, please.

00:15:08.910 --> 00:15:09.480
You...

00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:11.000
Heizi.

00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:13.120
Heizi!

00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:15.120
Go get the guy some food.

00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:27.030
I woke up this morning

00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:28.390
feeling refreshed and spirited.

00:15:28.390 --> 00:15:30.650
Turns out it was because you were coming.

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:31.840
Heizi.

00:15:32.390 --> 00:15:33.320
Run to Tianfu Restaurant

00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:35.000
and order their finest dishes.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:36.560
We'll be talking. No time to cook.

00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:37.690
Bring the things in.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:38.560
Yu'er!

00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:40.240
Look who's here.

00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:41.150
Mr. Chang.

00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:42.480
Mr. Chang, don't call Yu'er yet.

00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:43.120
This time,

00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:44.800
I came on my mother's orders.

00:15:47.430 --> 00:15:48.290
Let's talk inside.

00:15:48.290 --> 00:15:48.720
Okay.

00:16:11.550 --> 00:16:12.610
What are you doing?

00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:20.320
I made a mistake!

00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:26.670
Mr. Gu.

00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:28.150
Check for me.

00:16:28.390 --> 00:16:29.250
Is it straight?

00:16:32.650 --> 00:16:33.670
Yes, straight.

00:16:34.370 --> 00:16:35.900
I rarely pay formal visits.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.460
I don't have fine clothes.

00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:39.430
Since you are here
on your mother's orders,

00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:41.270
we must observe proper etiquette.

00:16:41.270 --> 00:16:41.910
Mr. Gu.

00:16:42.390 --> 00:16:43.240
Please, sit.

00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:44.890
Speak your mind.

00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:45.670
Mr. Chang.

00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:46.750
From now on,

00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:48.080
you should stop calling me

00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:48.670
Mr. Gu.

00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:50.020
That's too formal and polite.

00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:51.080
Out with it.

00:16:51.150 --> 00:16:52.600
I'll call you Big Brother if I have to.

00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:54.400
Mr. Chang, don't joke like that.

00:16:54.630 --> 00:16:55.120
Come.

00:16:55.270 --> 00:16:56.530
Please take your seat.

00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:14.270
I, Gu Pingyuan,

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.200
by my mother's order,

00:17:16.270 --> 00:17:17.730
came to propose marriage.

00:17:19.430 --> 00:17:21.160
Mr. Chang, I beg your blessing.

00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:23.099
I wish to marry your daughter,

00:17:23.230 --> 00:17:24.560
Chang Yu'er, as my wife,

00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:27.270
to unite our families forever.

00:17:33.210 --> 00:17:35.160
This is the betrothal letter I prepared.

00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:36.420
And my birth date card.

00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:39.080
I also prepared a betrothal gift.

00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:41.080
It's a keepsake from my late father.

00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:43.200
My mother said she can't see well

00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:44.640
and has trouble walking,

00:17:45.030 --> 00:17:46.890
so I must deliver the gift myself.

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:48.620
My manners may be lacking.

00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:51.500
Mr. Chang, please forgive me.

00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:12.810
You really are something.

00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:17.420
I knew this day would come.

00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:21.830
Why did you wait until now

00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:23.360
to marry my daughter?

00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:25.550
She's been waiting for ages.

00:18:26.310 --> 00:18:27.400
I was a convict.

00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:29.880
Thanks to you and Miss Chang,

00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:30.810
I'm still alive.

00:18:31.550 --> 00:18:32.590
Before, at home,

00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:35.070
there were old scores unsettled.

00:18:35.070 --> 00:18:36.000
I dared not come.

00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:38.000
Mr. Gu, please rise.

00:18:41.330 --> 00:18:42.180
Mr. Chang.

00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:43.880
Stop calling me

00:18:44.730 --> 00:18:45.600
Mr. Gu.

00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:47.410
Old habits die hard.

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:48.960
Today,

00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:51.440
I really didn't expect this.

00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:55.240
Yu'er always says

00:18:55.430 --> 00:18:57.510
she wants to support me until I die.

00:18:57.830 --> 00:18:59.110
But I am old

00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:00.200
and a burden to her.

00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:01.640
I feel uneasy about it.

00:19:02.390 --> 00:19:03.480
To tell you the truth,

00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:04.830
I wish I could immediately

00:19:04.830 --> 00:19:06.240
go on a long-distance trade run.

00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:07.430
Even to Tianshan.

00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:08.910
Even if I died on the road,

00:19:09.070 --> 00:19:10.090
it'd be better than

00:19:10.090 --> 00:19:11.180
watching her

00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:13.080
be depressed every day.

00:19:18.110 --> 00:19:18.920
Look at me.

00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:20.830
I'm getting old,

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:22.110
going a bit crazy.

00:19:22.110 --> 00:19:24.240
Crying one moment, laughing the next.

00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:27.960
Go tell her now.

00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:33.720
Yu'er!

00:19:34.510 --> 00:19:35.640
Where are you going?

00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:38.510
She is a girl.

00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:40.480
Let her cry it out.

00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:42.150
After she cries,

00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:43.590
she will feel better.

00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:44.640
Don't go.

00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:52.270
♪ Tea picking in January
marks the new year ♪

00:19:53.030 --> 00:19:54.640
♪ Tea picking in February ♪

00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:55.510
What's with you?

00:19:55.510 --> 00:19:56.790
Grinning like a fool.

00:19:57.420 --> 00:19:58.110
I'm happy.

00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:00.970
You can't fool me.

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:02.070
It must be because your mother

00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:03.800
has been smiling at you lately.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.070
If anyone's happy, it's your brother.

00:20:06.070 --> 00:20:07.640
All his suffering has finally paid off.

00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:09.440
You surely never went to school.

00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:11.000
This is called proper hierarchy.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:11.830
When parents are alive,

00:20:11.830 --> 00:20:13.030
children shouldn't travel far.

00:20:13.030 --> 00:20:13.790
If my brother is single,

00:20:13.790 --> 00:20:14.590
I stay unwed.

00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:17.310
You surely are.

00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:23.430
Your brother isn't back yet?

00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:25.640
I told the assistants down the mountain

00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:27.140
to wait at the dock, morning and night.

00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:29.070
Once he's back, I'll go pick him up.

00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:30.900
Thank you for the meal.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:32.200
It's the least I could do.

00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:32.960
This time,

00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:34.550
Pingyuan is finally seeing better days.

00:20:34.550 --> 00:20:36.510
This is the best news in the world.

00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:38.230
I am clumsy sometimes.

00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:39.350
If I missed anything,

00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:40.800
don't scold me.

00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:43.030
Mother.

00:20:43.270 --> 00:20:44.680
I heard my sister-in-law

00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:46.030
comes from a martial background.

00:20:46.030 --> 00:20:47.110
An expert fighter.

00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:50.350
We two brothers

00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:51.680
just don't have the fate

00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:53.680
to have gentle, considerate wives.

00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:54.960
I'll beat you up.

00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:55.680
I dare you!

00:20:57.530 --> 00:20:59.240
Why did you brew the guest tea?

00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:01.530
Switch to the rough tea.

00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:02.370
Mother.

00:21:02.550 --> 00:21:04.240
We won't drink that tea anymore.

00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:05.380
Haven't you heard?

00:21:05.450 --> 00:21:06.830
Pingyuan made a name for himself

00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:08.090
in Shanghai this time.

00:21:08.110 --> 00:21:09.510
You remember Hou Er, right?

00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:11.080
He used to be so arrogant.

00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:12.280
Now, when he sees me

00:21:12.350 --> 00:21:13.280
from a mile away,

00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:14.720
he hangs his head like a whipped dog.

00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:15.550
"Mr. Pingwen."

00:21:15.550 --> 00:21:16.470
"Mr. Pingwen."

00:21:16.830 --> 00:21:18.110
I used to be just Gu Pingwen,

00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:19.590
but now I'm Mr. Pingwen.

00:21:20.790 --> 00:21:22.680
This respect wasn't given to us.

00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:24.110
We earned it ourselves.

00:21:24.270 --> 00:21:25.830
Back then, on the dragon boat,

00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:26.930
we nearly died.

00:21:27.070 --> 00:21:28.400
As they say, "Survive a great disaster,

00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:30.200
and great fortune will follow."

00:21:30.590 --> 00:21:31.790
That tea smells wonderful.

00:21:31.790 --> 00:21:33.020
Pour me a cup of it.

00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:41.760
Sir, you are…

00:21:45.110 --> 00:21:45.870
Pingwen.

00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:47.680
Pour some tea for the guest.

00:21:51.410 --> 00:21:52.290
Sir.

00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:54.550
Are you looking to rest your feet

00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:56.890
or join us for a meal?

00:21:58.160 --> 00:21:59.240
Old Madam Gu.

00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:01.880
My surname is Wu.

00:22:02.030 --> 00:22:02.680
I came over

00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:04.480
on behalf of my good friend, Gu Pingyuan,

00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:05.880
to take a look at the bridal chamber.

00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:07.440
I'm afraid he won't have time to prepare,

00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:08.480
and the bride might feel slighted.

00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:08.880
So

00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:10.160
I rushed over here

00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:11.880
without giving you prior notice.

00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:13.480
Please forgive my intrusion.

00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:15.210
You must be the "God of Wealth."

00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:17.180
What God of Wealth?

00:22:17.210 --> 00:22:17.510
[Spring Breeze of Yi River]

00:22:17.510 --> 00:22:19.830
That's just a nickname people gave me

00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:20.860
to flatter me.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:22.160
I dare not accept it.

00:22:22.750 --> 00:22:23.280
I

00:22:23.310 --> 00:22:25.320
have the most debt in the world.

00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:27.290
I can't be called the God of Wealth.

00:22:27.290 --> 00:22:28.110
At best,

00:22:28.510 --> 00:22:29.790
I'm the God of Debt.

00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:34.320
He has such a good friend,

00:22:34.350 --> 00:22:36.000
but he never told us.

00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:37.170
Pingwen.

00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:39.070
Add a pair of chopsticks,

00:22:39.170 --> 00:22:40.430
and cook another dish.

00:22:40.750 --> 00:22:41.180
Come.

00:22:41.180 --> 00:22:41.400
[Spring Breeze of Yi River]

00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:42.510
Eat with us.

00:22:42.850 --> 00:22:43.480
Sure.

00:22:43.810 --> 00:22:45.010
I happen to be hungry.

00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:46.450
There are a few eggs left.

00:22:46.450 --> 00:22:47.350
I'll go fry them.

00:22:47.350 --> 00:22:47.860
No need.

00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:49.000
This is good enough.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:50.500
It's fine. It'll be quick.

00:22:51.250 --> 00:22:52.560
I'll take this bowl.

00:22:52.590 --> 00:22:53.240
Sure.

00:22:53.270 --> 00:22:54.270
No one has used it.

00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:55.400
Here.

00:22:55.790 --> 00:22:56.680
Alright.

00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:10.550
Sir.

00:23:11.430 --> 00:23:12.490
Good or bad?

00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:13.640
Just say it.

00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:15.860
Don't rush.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:17.510
Maybe he calculated wrong.

00:23:17.510 --> 00:23:19.030
Mr. Chang, I've kowtowed to you.

00:23:19.030 --> 00:23:19.510
No matter what,

00:23:19.510 --> 00:23:21.170
you have to let me marry Yu'er.

00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:22.550
I'll face whatever difficulties come.

00:23:22.550 --> 00:23:22.920
Okay.

00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:26.780
Mr. Gu's fate

00:23:27.310 --> 00:23:28.720
is not very good.

00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:31.720
Others will become pillars of society.

00:23:31.750 --> 00:23:34.240
Why doesn't the scholar return home early?

00:23:34.550 --> 00:23:36.310
You will toil your whole life

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:37.880
and rarely return home.

00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:44.920
This young lady's fate

00:23:46.410 --> 00:23:48.320
is also strange.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.510
Body and soul held in others' gaze.

00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:54.030
A lone boat drifting in the dark.

00:23:54.550 --> 00:23:57.160
If longing turns to stormy weather,

00:23:57.480 --> 00:24:00.110
who can easily find love?

00:24:00.310 --> 00:24:01.070
Isn't this

00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:04.270
utterly bizarre?

00:24:06.510 --> 00:24:09.880
It means the first half of life
drifting in storms

00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:14.000
and the second half in solitary longing.

00:24:14.070 --> 00:24:14.960
No, wait. What?

00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:16.220
Solitary longing?

00:24:16.350 --> 00:24:17.210
I am right here.

00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:18.040
What longing?

00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:18.920
Sir.

00:24:19.070 --> 00:24:21.590
Read these two horoscopes together.

00:24:22.270 --> 00:24:24.160
Don't rush.

00:24:25.030 --> 00:24:26.950
When these two fates

00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:28.820
are combined…

00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:33.470
Once they meet, no matter where or when,

00:24:33.550 --> 00:24:37.440
they find their true selves in each other.

00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:41.440
It means husband and wife
will stay together

00:24:41.550 --> 00:24:44.580
until the end of their days.

00:24:45.270 --> 00:24:46.510
I told you so!

00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:47.350
Heizi.

00:24:47.730 --> 00:24:49.730
Take the gentleman to get some food.

00:24:49.790 --> 00:24:50.450
Here, here.

00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:51.840
Take this red packet.

00:24:52.350 --> 00:24:53.590
Thank you. Thank you.

00:24:54.130 --> 00:24:55.110
Please.

00:24:55.550 --> 00:24:56.480
Farewell.

00:24:59.110 --> 00:24:59.720
Back when I was

00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:01.250
down and out in my hometown,

00:25:01.270 --> 00:25:03.270
I ate "door-plank meals" every day.

00:25:03.690 --> 00:25:04.830
Thinking about it now,

00:25:04.830 --> 00:25:05.760
it wasn't so bad.

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:07.060
I actually miss it.

00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:09.480
What is a door-plank meal?

00:25:11.370 --> 00:25:12.890
For a door-plank meal,

00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:14.270
I'd go into restaurants

00:25:14.270 --> 00:25:15.640
after customers have finished eating

00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:17.310
and eat up whatever's left

00:25:17.350 --> 00:25:19.070
on their plates.

00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:22.240
Is this the place?

00:25:22.780 --> 00:25:23.790
[Blessings and Auspiciousness]

00:25:23.790 --> 00:25:25.050
Come on. Guys, come in.

00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:33.540
You're finally here.

00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:35.000
Everyone here?

00:25:35.110 --> 00:25:35.930
Yes.
Yes.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:36.960
All here.

00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:38.500
Listen to me.

00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:39.880
When you go in,

00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:40.880
first, clean up

00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:41.880
the main room

00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:43.200
and Old Madam Gu's room.

00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:44.420
Be gentle and quiet.

00:25:44.510 --> 00:25:45.110
Before dark,

00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:46.440
Old Madam Gu needs to use it.

00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:47.240
If she feels even a bit

00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:48.250
of discomfort,

00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:49.550
I won't have it.

00:25:50.030 --> 00:25:50.750
Then

00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:52.820
check inside and out,

00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:53.720
the courtyard and surroundings,

00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:55.310
up and down, front and back.

00:25:55.310 --> 00:25:56.510
Inspect everything.

00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:59.090
Replace anything broken with new ones.

00:25:59.090 --> 00:26:00.520
In short,

00:26:00.830 --> 00:26:02.030
renovate this house

00:26:02.030 --> 00:26:03.200
until it looks brand new.

00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:04.030
This house is

00:26:04.030 --> 00:26:05.430
for my friend's wedding.

00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:06.510
Don't let my friend

have any reason

-Do you understand?

-Yes.
-Yes, sir.

-This is too much.
-Well, I'll take you there.

-Pingwen.
-Thank you.

Mr. Wu.

This… This is too much.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:18.960
This is too much.

00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:20.370
It's not too much at all.

00:26:20.370 --> 00:26:21.100
Old Madam Gu,

00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:22.370
it's the least I can do.

00:26:22.370 --> 00:26:23.290
As you said,

00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:24.400
we aren't some

00:26:24.420 --> 00:26:25.750
wealthy, noble family.

00:26:25.790 --> 00:26:26.920
As long as everything is fixed up

00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:28.400
to look presentable, that's enough.

00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:29.160
Don't worry.

00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:30.960
These are all

top craftsmen I hired from Hangzhou.

00:26:32.170 --> 00:26:33.370
They won't mess it up.

00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:34.860
They…

00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:35.590
They…

00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:39.590
I traveled thousands of miles to get here.

00:26:39.610 --> 00:26:41.410
It's just a little kind gesture.

00:26:41.550 --> 00:26:42.340
Old Madam Gu.

00:26:42.510 --> 00:26:43.960
Please indulge me.

00:26:48.030 --> 00:26:49.000
Mr. Gu.

00:26:50.070 --> 00:26:52.070
Let's go over the Three Letters

00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:53.200
and Six Rites.

00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:54.310
We clap if we both agree.

00:26:54.310 --> 00:26:54.750
Okay.

00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:58.640
I've already written the betrothal letter.

00:26:58.640 --> 00:26:58.960
In a bit,

00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:00.350
I'll send it to Yu'er.

00:27:00.590 --> 00:27:01.520
The gift letter…

00:27:01.790 --> 00:27:02.990
The gift list is here.

00:27:03.390 --> 00:27:03.510
[Gift List]

00:27:03.510 --> 00:27:05.000
It's a bit long. Take a look.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:06.240
As long as there is one, it's fine.

00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:07.030
I'll put it here for now.

00:27:07.030 --> 00:27:07.790
As for the wedding letter,

00:27:07.790 --> 00:27:09.030
it's used on the wedding day.

00:27:09.030 --> 00:27:10.160
We don't need it now.

00:27:10.350 --> 00:27:11.950
Those are the Three Letters.

00:27:12.790 --> 00:27:14.140
Now for the Six Rites.

00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:15.110
The first

00:27:15.270 --> 00:27:16.200
is the proposal.

The matchmaker's visit.

00:27:18.510 --> 00:27:19.570
Since you are here…

00:27:19.590 --> 00:27:20.270
It counts.

00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:21.940
I act as my own matchmaker.

00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:24.110
Second

00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:25.350
is birthdate matching.

00:27:25.350 --> 00:27:26.480
The fortune teller just now

00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:27.400
already checked your horoscopes.

00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:28.400
No problem there.

00:27:29.110 --> 00:27:30.110
Third

00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:31.510
is divination—

00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:33.550
picking the wedding date.

00:27:33.830 --> 00:27:35.560
We will do that back in Huizhou.

00:27:37.070 --> 00:27:37.790
Fourth

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:39.400
is presenting the gifts.

00:27:41.350 --> 00:27:41.950
Mr. Chang.

00:27:42.590 --> 00:27:44.440
This is my late father's keepsake.

00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:45.300
Keep it for now.

00:27:45.350 --> 00:27:47.590
Give it to Yu'er later.

00:27:47.890 --> 00:27:49.000
So that's settled.

00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:53.210
Fifth

00:27:53.310 --> 00:27:54.510
is setting the wedding date.

00:27:54.510 --> 00:27:57.040
Both sides need to agree on a date.

00:27:57.230 --> 00:27:58.030
I totally agree.

00:27:58.030 --> 00:27:58.920
I agree too.

00:28:00.870 --> 00:28:02.160
And the last one

00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:03.530
is welcoming the bride.

00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:04.980
On the wedding day,

00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:08.110
the groom needs
to bring the bride to his home.

00:28:08.750 --> 00:28:09.310
Done.

00:28:09.910 --> 00:28:10.830
No problems, right?

00:28:10.830 --> 00:28:11.790
If I don't bring her,

00:28:11.790 --> 00:28:13.390
does she walk there herself?

00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:14.030
Come on.

00:28:15.750 --> 00:28:16.230
Cheers.

00:28:16.420 --> 00:28:17.730
Cheers.

00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:32.000
Mr. Chang.

00:28:32.470 --> 00:28:33.070
Why hasn't Yu'er

00:28:33.070 --> 00:28:34.400
come over to eat with us?

00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:37.920
She's a girl.

00:28:38.570 --> 00:28:40.320
We're discussing her marriage.

00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:41.700
She's bound to be shy.

00:28:42.830 --> 00:28:43.830
Skipping a meal won't hurt.

00:28:43.830 --> 00:28:44.700
Come on.

00:28:45.860 --> 00:28:47.320
We've been talking all this time,

00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:47.920
but it seems we're just

00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:49.050
amusing ourselves.

00:28:49.470 --> 00:28:51.150
We haven't asked the girl involved.

00:28:51.150 --> 00:28:51.950
That's right.

00:28:53.900 --> 00:28:56.420
I felt something was missing too.

00:28:56.740 --> 00:28:57.600
It's fine.

00:28:58.240 --> 00:28:59.350
Go ask her yourself.

00:28:59.350 --> 00:29:00.950
I'll wait for you to drink.

00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:04.390
Hurry up, or the food will get cold.

00:29:04.550 --> 00:29:05.030
Wait.

00:29:05.070 --> 00:29:06.000
What should I do?

00:29:06.350 --> 00:29:08.340
Give her the betrothal letter and gifts.

00:29:08.340 --> 00:29:09.200
Then come back.

00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:10.480
She's in the room across the way.

00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:10.920
Go on.

00:29:11.070 --> 00:29:11.830
That simple?

00:29:12.110 --> 00:29:14.440
It's not some royal princess
getting married.

00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:15.800
We're poor folk.

00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:17.110
It's not that complicated.

00:29:17.110 --> 00:29:17.790
Go on.

00:29:30.590 --> 00:29:31.240
Yu'er.

00:29:33.110 --> 00:29:34.090
I have something for you.

00:29:34.090 --> 00:29:34.610
Yu'er.

00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:46.590
Just now,

00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:49.560
I was going over the rituals
with Mr. Chang.

00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:51.610
I didn't come to see you right away.

00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:53.360
Don't hold it against me.

00:29:56.920 --> 00:29:57.680
Back at Shanhai Pass,

00:29:57.680 --> 00:29:58.810
when we parted ways,

00:29:58.880 --> 00:29:59.810
didn't I tell you

00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:02.550
as soon as I had a moment to breathe,

00:30:02.550 --> 00:30:03.550
I'd come find you?

00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:05.790
Yu'er.

00:30:12.070 --> 00:30:12.830
Yu'er.

00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:16.440
Are you hungry?

00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:18.890
Do you want to go eat something?

00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:22.440
Sir.

00:30:22.790 --> 00:30:24.000
Thank you.

00:30:25.530 --> 00:30:26.920
Have some water.

00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:27.560
Rest a bit.

00:30:29.380 --> 00:30:30.030
Here, sir.

00:30:30.270 --> 00:30:32.090
Easy does it. Take it slow.

00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:33.690
Watch your safety up there.

00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:35.070
Have some water.

00:30:37.830 --> 00:30:38.520
Thank you.

00:30:40.550 --> 00:30:41.550
Thanks.

00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:44.480
God of Wealth.

00:30:44.790 --> 00:30:45.930
These materials...

00:30:46.030 --> 00:30:47.430
we have them locally too.

00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:48.070
Why ship them

00:30:48.070 --> 00:30:49.270
all the way from Zhejiang?

00:30:49.270 --> 00:30:50.330
You have them here?

00:30:51.110 --> 00:30:52.270
I don't think so.

00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:55.340
Take this white mud for instance.

00:30:55.350 --> 00:30:57.640
It's made from sticky rice pulp
and limestone,

00:30:57.640 --> 00:30:59.170
pounded ten thousand times

00:30:59.390 --> 00:31:00.990
and washed perfectly clean.

00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:03.350
Pointing the walls with it
prevents termites.

00:31:03.350 --> 00:31:04.410
As for weathering,

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:06.930
I won't claim it lasts 1,000 years,

00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:08.960
but several hundred years for sure.

00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:10.880
Only Zhejiang people

00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:12.160
know how to make it.

00:31:12.660 --> 00:31:13.400
I especially

00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:14.720
went to an old craftsman

00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:16.500
and used his old stock

00:31:16.590 --> 00:31:17.830
just for this.

00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:20.720
Mr. Gu

00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:21.590
just doesn't know

00:31:21.590 --> 00:31:22.900
how to deal with women.

00:31:22.940 --> 00:31:24.680
He can't learn that.

00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:28.280
The grand ceremony is prepared.

00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:30.400
A fine union is established.

00:31:31.070 --> 00:31:33.600
With deep affection
like inseparable birds,

00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:36.430
may we have respect for each other.

00:31:37.310 --> 00:31:39.110
May we be blessed with fertility

00:31:39.130 --> 00:31:41.320
and prosperity for our descendants.

00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:43.210
With one heart and one mind,

00:31:43.270 --> 00:31:45.000
may we build a harmonious home.

00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:46.960
May we be united forever

00:31:47.270 --> 00:31:48.790
as a loving couple,

00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:51.030
like in the poem of Guan Ju

00:31:51.270 --> 00:31:53.160
and the elegant song of Lin Zhi.

00:31:54.270 --> 00:31:56.640
May prosperity last for five generations,

00:31:56.640 --> 00:31:58.960
and our virtue spread like the classics.

00:31:59.070 --> 00:32:00.590
Respect each other

00:32:00.850 --> 00:32:04.050
and enjoy harmonious intimacy forever.

00:32:05.550 --> 00:32:07.310
Help each other with sincerity,

00:32:07.310 --> 00:32:09.750
and pledge our love like mandarin ducks.

00:32:10.030 --> 00:32:12.890
Rejoice that today,
the red thread binds us

00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:14.450
in a perfect union,

00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:17.750
and may we grow old together

00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:20.110
with fragrant happiness.

00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:23.260
In witness hereof.

00:32:37.310 --> 00:32:37.880
Yu'er.

00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:40.260
I also prepared a betrothal gift.

00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:42.000
It is a keepsake my father

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:43.240
left for the family.

00:32:46.770 --> 00:32:50.140
[Chang]

00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:07.160
Yu'er.

00:33:09.350 --> 00:33:11.210
What exactly are you upset about?

00:33:11.570 --> 00:33:12.970
Open the door and tell me.

00:33:14.990 --> 00:33:16.120
I'm not very clever.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:18.860
I can't guess if you don't tell me.

00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:22.680
We have faced death together.

00:33:23.900 --> 00:33:25.400
You can tell me anything.

00:33:28.790 --> 00:33:29.550
I admit

00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:31.270
I am a bit dense.

00:33:34.110 --> 00:33:36.110
I thought it through on the way here.

00:33:37.940 --> 00:33:39.200
Since I'm here,

00:33:40.710 --> 00:33:42.170
all those past matters...

00:33:44.110 --> 00:33:45.910
I've left them outside the door.

00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:49.090
For any previous

00:33:50.270 --> 00:33:51.000
thoughtlessness

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:52.460
or disrespect toward you,

00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:56.160
if you feel upset,

00:33:57.870 --> 00:33:58.930
just open the door.

00:34:00.270 --> 00:34:01.470
Come out and scold me.

00:34:02.110 --> 00:34:02.920
Hit me.

00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:04.640
Anything is fine.

00:34:05.950 --> 00:34:07.280
As long as you are happy.

00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:13.000
Yu'er.

00:34:18.290 --> 00:34:19.150
Stop talking.

00:34:19.510 --> 00:34:20.570
I'm going to sleep.

00:34:44.290 --> 00:34:51.389
[Chang]

00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:10.000
Yu'er.

00:35:10.590 --> 00:35:11.760
You two

00:35:11.780 --> 00:35:13.510
have been drinking since noon.

00:35:13.510 --> 00:35:14.320
You stayed behind

00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:15.520
closed doors all day.

00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:17.590
We were drinking while waiting for you.

00:35:17.590 --> 00:35:18.760
Mr. Chang was already drunk.

00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:19.890
I told him to go rest.

00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:22.170
He insisted on waiting with me.

00:35:22.190 --> 00:35:24.050
So we drank until he got like this.

00:35:25.030 --> 00:35:25.880
Great.

00:35:26.590 --> 00:35:27.980
When you're not here,

00:35:28.110 --> 00:35:29.150
I let my father drink

00:35:29.150 --> 00:35:30.510
only a little every day.

00:35:30.630 --> 00:35:31.710
Once I closed my door today,

00:35:31.710 --> 00:35:33.110
you two really let loose.

00:35:33.150 --> 00:35:34.000
He is old.

00:35:34.030 --> 00:35:35.430
He can't drink this much.

00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:43.280
Mr. Chang was a hero all his life.

00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:44.360
Now that he's old,

00:35:44.510 --> 00:35:46.150
he has to take attitude from his child.

00:35:46.150 --> 00:35:47.750
Who dares give him attitude?

00:35:50.550 --> 00:35:51.150
Yu'er.

00:35:52.230 --> 00:35:52.840
Sit down.

00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:54.190
Talk to me.

00:35:58.360 --> 00:35:59.150
What for?

00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:02.710
I came here

00:36:02.710 --> 00:36:04.640
to deliver the marriage proposal.

00:36:05.210 --> 00:36:06.870
Why are you so annoyed with me?

00:36:07.530 --> 00:36:08.480
Are you smug?

00:36:09.030 --> 00:36:10.590
Waiting for me to kowtow and thank you?

00:36:10.590 --> 00:36:11.230
No.

00:36:12.590 --> 00:36:13.520
I wouldn't dare.

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:16.360
I hope you'll agree.

00:36:18.150 --> 00:36:19.400
I agree?

00:36:19.810 --> 00:36:21.230
Even my father thinks

00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:22.280
if I don't accept you,

00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:23.320
I'd be ungrateful

00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:24.190
and foolish.

00:36:24.590 --> 00:36:25.920
I find it strange.

00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:28.030
Back then, when you left,

00:36:28.360 --> 00:36:29.670
my father called you a hero,

00:36:29.670 --> 00:36:30.440
a good man.

00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:32.190
Now you've come to propose,

00:36:32.190 --> 00:36:33.400
and he still calls you a hero,

00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:34.110
a good man.

00:36:34.670 --> 00:36:35.480
Why do you men

00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:36.510
have 1,000 excuses for everything

00:36:36.510 --> 00:36:38.110
while whatever I do is wrong?

00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:39.640
Truly hypocritical.

00:36:44.550 --> 00:36:45.150
Right.

00:36:45.630 --> 00:36:46.230
Well said.

00:36:46.590 --> 00:36:47.320
Well said.

00:36:58.550 --> 00:36:59.670
If you still feel

00:36:59.710 --> 00:37:01.150
bound by debts of gratitude,

00:37:01.150 --> 00:37:02.550
you don't have to be here.

00:37:05.030 --> 00:37:05.840
My father saved you.

00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:06.760
You saved him.

00:37:07.190 --> 00:37:09.030
Now he has retired.

00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:10.800
The messy scores

00:37:11.230 --> 00:37:12.760
are better left unsettled.

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:17.400
As for my feelings,

00:37:18.030 --> 00:37:19.360
that's my own business.

00:37:21.190 --> 00:37:22.800
I never asked anything of you.

00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:24.200
So don't take it to heart.

00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:25.440
Yu'er.

00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:27.960
What do you mean by that?

00:37:32.110 --> 00:37:32.840
I...

00:37:36.190 --> 00:37:37.110
I...

00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:40.280
I thought of you

00:37:41.940 --> 00:37:43.320
day and night.

00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:47.030
But it was never like this.

00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:52.040
Then what was it like?

00:37:57.770 --> 00:37:58.910
It was...

00:38:03.150 --> 00:38:04.190
Your eyes.

00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:07.150
Brows.

00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:10.320
Teeth.

00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:12.800
If you are reborn in another life,

00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:13.880
even among thousands of people,

00:38:13.880 --> 00:38:15.740
I could recognize you at a glance.

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:18.710
I...

00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:23.170
I never expected
to marry you in this life.

00:38:25.710 --> 00:38:26.400
Yu'er.

00:38:28.140 --> 00:38:29.550
Today feels like a dream.

00:38:29.570 --> 00:38:30.070
I...

00:38:30.440 --> 00:38:31.840
I'm speaking nonsense.

00:38:35.590 --> 00:38:36.150
What

00:38:37.190 --> 00:38:38.190
are you afraid of?

00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:40.530
I'm afraid this is just a dream.

00:38:42.550 --> 00:38:45.550
I'm more afraid your feelings
aren't the same as mine.

00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:47.370
Does this look like a dream?

00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:50.560
Are dreams this real?

00:38:50.670 --> 00:38:52.150
Sometimes dreams are this real.

00:38:52.150 --> 00:38:53.010
You don't know.

00:38:53.150 --> 00:38:54.000
I know.

00:38:55.230 --> 00:38:56.360
Of course I know.

00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:01.550
Waking up...

00:39:03.510 --> 00:39:04.910
with a heart full of pain.

00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:08.360
Some words

00:39:10.110 --> 00:39:11.510
cannot be said to others.

00:39:17.370 --> 00:39:19.420
If I hadn't been woken up,

00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:21.150
I really don't know

00:39:21.150 --> 00:39:22.800
how long I'd stay confused.

00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:26.330
Someone as smart as you

00:39:27.550 --> 00:39:29.060
needs waking up?

00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:31.920
Then…

00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:35.930
how are the rest of us supposed to live?

00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:48.480
Don't mess with me.

00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:50.880
Earlier,

00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:53.110
your betrothal letter…

00:39:53.110 --> 00:39:55.310
I didn't understand a single word of it.

00:40:01.190 --> 00:40:03.050
I want to hear your true feelings.

00:40:04.110 --> 00:40:04.970
True feelings?

00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:07.960
Alright.

00:40:11.570 --> 00:40:12.260
You...

00:40:19.660 --> 00:40:21.260
You are unforgettable to me.

00:40:24.210 --> 00:40:25.300
Meeting you

00:40:26.810 --> 00:40:28.940
is the most memorable thing in my life.

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:33.360
All my true feelings

00:40:35.080 --> 00:40:36.810
can be expressed in four words.

00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:39.710
You are...

00:40:43.110 --> 00:40:44.480
etched in my heart.

00:41:05.500 --> 00:41:06.610
Me too.

00:41:38.170 --> 00:41:39.110
I can't take it anymore.

00:41:39.110 --> 00:41:40.040
I can't stand it.

00:41:40.610 --> 00:41:41.810
I'm done pretending.

00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:43.400
Too tired.

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:45.000
Too tired.
