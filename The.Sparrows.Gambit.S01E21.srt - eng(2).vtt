[The Sparrow's Gambit]

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.500
[Episode 21]

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:07.620
Cry if you need to.

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:11.900
Let it out. You'll feel better.

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:15.620
When I first learned

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:17.100
that Wang Penghui

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.940
was the one who killed my family,

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.220
I broke down crying many times, too.

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:27.780
You don't need

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:31.300
to be strong around me.

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.020
After my mother died,

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.700
I was sent to the orphanage.

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.340
Kids bullied me

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:45.700
and beat me.

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:49.580
My life was dark

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.180
until he showed up.

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:55.700
He took me home,

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.220
gave me everything I'd dreamed of,

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.300
and taught me to read, to fight...

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.020
Besides you,

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.140
he's the most important person to me.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:15.900
So why...

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.420
why did everything turn out like this?

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:35.820
Here, look.

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:41.340
My father gave me this.

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.940
He said

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:47.180
even wounded and lonely,

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.580
it still takes off to the sky.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:53.940
You said the wind carries the kite.

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:58.340
Now I want to be your wind,

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:02.180
always by your side.

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:30.620
Drink as much as you want. I'll stay.

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:32.500
But promise me

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:35.900
when you're sober,

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:38.820
you'll pull yourself together.

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:41.020
Alright?

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:16.940
You're back.

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:22.820
Go get some rest.

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:30.620
Dad.

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:34.340
I dreamed of my mom last night.

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:37.580
She asked

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:39.820
why I'm so stubborn.

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:46.780
Wenjin...

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:51.300
She resented me for leaving you
in that orphanage.

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:53.020
She hasn't visited my dreams in years.

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:55.100
What did she say?

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:58.820
She was furious with me.

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:00.940
Said I'd been wrong.

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:04.100
But Dad,

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:07.940
what exactly did I do wrong?

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:15.900
Next time you're out late,

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:18.500
wear more layers.

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:20.500
Don't catch a cold.

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:23.500
Your mother's reminding you

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:28.340
that time shows someone's true colors.

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:42.980
Who you trust to watch your back,

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:45.340
that's your call.

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:37.340
Any unusual moves

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:38.900
from Wenbin?

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:41.140
Out all night for days.

00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:44.340
With whom?

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:45.900
Miss Liu.

00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:51.220
He is not to leave the house.

00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:53.020
And remember,

00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:56.340
keep him away from the basement.

00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:57.940
Yes, sir.

00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:04.340
Liu Rumeng again...

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:21.940
Mr. Chen,

00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:24.820
quite the welcoming party.

00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:26.700
What brings you here?

00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:29.140
I'm here to inform you

00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:30.820
that I'm taking over

00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:33.700
the Song City Opium Case from today on.

00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:36.220
You're clever, Miss Liu,

00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:37.540
but sometimes

00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:39.780
painfully naive.

00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:41.020
One woman taking on the world?

00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:43.100
That's not how this place works.

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:46.540
Planning to kill me?

00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:49.740
If killing could solve everything

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:51.220
so easily,

00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:53.500
why'd you spend months at the Wangs'?

00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:56.500
Besides, Wenbin cares for you.

00:08:56.740 --> 00:08:58.180
If I killed you,

00:08:58.500 --> 00:08:59.580
my son and I

00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:02.700
would be finished.

00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:04.580
You're sharp.

00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:07.940
Sharp people know how to play the game.

00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:09.300
What do you want?

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:10.540
Name it.

00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:12.340
The Chamber of Commerce?

00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:14.380
Money?

00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:19.100
Ah, right.

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:21.580
You don't care for such things.

00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:23.900
Then what about Wenbin?

00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:25.780
Keep this up,

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:28.540
and you're done with him.

00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:31.100
We choose

00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:33.340
our own path.

00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:36.020
You're being silly again.

00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:37.780
You're just the daughter

00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:39.900
of the late Chamber President.

00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:41.980
The Lin name is gone.

00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:43.340
How does one woman fight

00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:45.540
against the empire my family built?

00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:47.860
I'm really curious,

00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:49.740
what exactly will you do?

00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:51.060
Are you done?

00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:53.180
For Wenbin's sake,

00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:55.100
take my advice and walk away.

00:09:56.980 --> 00:09:59.220
I never offer a second chance.

00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:12.100
What's going on?

00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:13.620
Why all the guards?

00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:14.940
How's the warehouse lead?

00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:16.700
Don't even ask.

00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:17.660
Higher-ups sent someone.

00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:18.420
They took over the case.

00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:20.740
The lead's dead now.

00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:22.740
Gone for good.

00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:23.660
What's that mean?

00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:25.500
Well,

00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:27.540
your father's running the show.

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.900
It's a classic case

00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:32.540
of the fox guarding the henhouse.

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.420
Wenbin, he's your father.

00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:44.100
Can you really go against him?

00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:46.980
I know

00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:49.780
I can't undo what's been done.

00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:50.740
But he's still my father,

00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:52.580
I can't watch him sink further.

00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:55.140
I didn't get it before, not like Rumeng.

00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:57.100
Now I finally do.

00:10:58.260 --> 00:10:59.340
Chasing the truth,

00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:01.340
that's what makes me feel alive.

00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:03.940
Stick to the plan.

00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:06.780
Careful, lots of eyes outside.

00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:17.940
Nothing here.

00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:19.340
Let's go.

00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:31.940
Move this.

00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:40.860
Su Zhengzhi?

00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:43.100
Su Zhengzhi, is that you?

00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:44.580
It's Chen Wenbin.

00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:53.660
Hurry!

00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:00.980
Wenbin! Wenbin!

00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:02.980
Someone's coming. Go! Now!

00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:04.940
Tomorrow's the Chen family banquet.

00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:06.340
I'll get you out then.

00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:08.100
Go! There's no time!
