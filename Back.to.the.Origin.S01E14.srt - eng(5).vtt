00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:59.000
Aiying.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.080
I've got some news. Want it?

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.800
Stop fooling around. Out with it.

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.280
Yudong's going back to Canada.

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:10.720
Nonsense.

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.960
It's true.

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:13.840
Right here yesterday,

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.000
we had a heart-to-heart talk.

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.079
He told me himself.

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.680
He's going back to Canada.

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.400
But Zhang Ran's staying.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:22.960
They have their own

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.280
reasons.

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.440
What reasons?

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:26.480
Separated today,

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:27.640
they'll be divorced tomorrow.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:29.000
Besides,

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:31.880
all this "Rice Guy" nonsense

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:32.560
going public in her livestreams...

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:33.840
The whole world knows!

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.400
It's only because Yudong

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.920
is kind and lets her have her way.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.440
Even I can't stand it.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.040
You know how divorce goes.

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.360
Once you break that seal,

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.000
there's no turning back.

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:47.600
I'm not wasting breath on this.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:48.079
I must...

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.240
Calm down.

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.760
I don't think Yudong will leave.

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.200
Why wouldn't he?

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:56.680
He told me

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.320
he's going back to work,

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:00.840
for Ran.

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.280
If Ran's career doesn't work out here,

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:04.320
he'll be her safety net.

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:05.480
The family won't fall apart.

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:06.960
You actually believe that?

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:10.440
Ran.

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:12.680
I'm coming in.

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:13.320
Yeah.

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.800
Hmm?

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:22.920
I'm good.

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:23.800
About time for work.

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:24.400
Leaving soon.

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:27.560
Your mom cut you

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:28.760
this melon specially.

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:33.400
Just get to the point.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:37.960
Yudong's going back to Canada?

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:43.840
He's going. I'm not.

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.000
You two

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:48.960
are married now.

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:51.920
You make your own decisions.

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.200
Your mom and I won't interfere.

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.000
This is the first time

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.760
you've brought Yudong back for me

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.120
and your mom to meet.

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.080
We really like him.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.760
Not because he's handsome

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:04.760
or tall.

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.800
He's down-to-earth and responsible.

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.800
Most importantly, he treats you well.

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.280
As long as you two

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:13.960
live happily together,

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:15.360
whether it's here

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:16.760
or somewhere else,

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:19.040
your mom and I will be at ease.

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:23.640
So you're now

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.240
Mom's spy on the side?

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:27.720
We're family,

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.200
no need for this spy stuff.

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:32.520
Let me analyze this for you:

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.400
Yudong is

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:35.400
a good man.

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.840
He's different from most young people

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:38.520
these days.

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.040
He's a bit like me.

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.600
Don't make me laugh.

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.440
He knows how to be a supportive husband.

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:49.360
When Ran said she wanted to come back,

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:50.640
he came right along.

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.480
Not long ago, in Ran's livestream,

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:53.960
that "Rice Guy" thing,

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:56.240
that was Ran's fault.

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:57.560
What did Yudong say?

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:59.520
Not a single word of complaint.

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.040
But he should stand his ground, right?

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:05.960
He needs to draw a clear line

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:09.240
for Ran as a warning.

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.680
So he says he's going back to Canada

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.320
just to give our daughter

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:16.720
a graceful exit.

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:18.920
If Ran just admits she was wrong,

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:20.880
softens up a bit, acts sweet,

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:22.960
this whole thing will blow over.

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:24.080
Ran.

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:27.160
You're not in the right this time.

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.040
That livestream,

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.280
that "Rice Guy" story...

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:33.640
You embarrassed Yudong.

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:35.040
Did he say anything?

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:36.640
Not a single word of complaint.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.560
Sweetie, you really were in the wrong.

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:41.720
Ran

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:44.159
is as stubborn as a mule!

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:45.680
Apologize?

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:46.800
Say something soft?

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.200
Not a chance!

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:51.920
He wants to go back to Canada,

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:53.360
and I haven't complained either.

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:55.000
I'm not stopping him.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
I respect his decision.

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:58.760
She gets that stubbornness from you.

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:00.040
What do you mean?

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:01.400
Keep it down.

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:05.640
I was just watching a video.

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:09.840
It said we shouldn't meddle too much.

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:11.440
Too much pressure

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:13.160
only makes her rebel.

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:14.680
If you just go along with her,

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:16.040
maybe she'll come around

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:17.640
on her own.

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.480
You need to understand

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:20.880
that family

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:22.360
isn't about who's right.

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:24.440
It's about love.

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:27.160
You only see the surface.

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:30.360
You don't know Yudong's feelings.

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:33.040
What does a man want?

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:37.240
They just want dignity.

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:39.640
Him bringing up

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:41.040
going back to Canada

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:42.960
proves he cares about you.

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:45.360
About that livestream,

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:47.520
just say something nice to him.

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:49.400
Give him a way out.

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:50.680
I guarantee,

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:53.120
he'll do whatever you say.

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:56.520
Alright, I need to change.

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:57.680
Time for work.

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:01.240
Listen to your old man.

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:02.000
Give it a try.

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:04.720
Now you're not gonna give it to me?

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:06.560
I'll eat it.

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:06.960
Never mind.

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:07.800
I need to change.

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:43.800
On regular dates,

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:45.680
guys usually like girls in dresses.

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:47.240
Because dresses

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:48.760
make girls

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:50.159
look elegant

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:51.159
and gentle.

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:54.120
But in special cases,

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:55.840
like if your crush

00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:56.640
is a toy boy,

00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:57.640
then girls,

00:07:57.840 --> 00:07:58.680
it's best to...

00:07:58.680 --> 00:07:59.440
Anran.

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:00.920
Memorizing lines?

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.240
You're working too hard.

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:03.840
Take a break.

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:05.400
Why so serious?

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:07.200
Other top streamers are just

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:08.320
messing around.

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:08.800
I need to

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:10.000
keep updating myself,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:10.600
right?

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:11.600
So dedicated.

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:13.320
What's a toy boy?

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:15.360
You don't know that?

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:16.400
It means

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:18.360
a guy younger than you.

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:20.440
There's the "puppy" type

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:23.040
and the "wolf" type.

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:25.880
First time I've heard that.

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:26.560
Learned something new.

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:27.480
Anran.

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:30.320
Today's lucky color fruit.

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:33.440
How did you know

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:35.280
my lucky color today is green?

00:08:36.039 --> 00:08:37.880
Been working with you so long,

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:39.039
of course I have your lucky color

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:40.720
memorized by heart.

00:08:44.159 --> 00:08:45.920
Well, Anran.

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:47.640
There's something I wanna

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.800
talk to you about.

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:52.040
What is it? Go ahead.

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:55.520
It's not a big deal, really.

00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:56.320
It's just that

00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:57.720
recently, the company

00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:59.200
got me some ads.

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:00.280
And some of them

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:02.680
target middle-class clients.

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:04.560
So the planning team said

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:06.240
my future style shouldn't be

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:07.960
so low-key.

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:13.520
I see.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.360
You're gonna take

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:18.720
the handsome guy route.

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:20.120
Gonna be an idol.

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:21.600
Nah.

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:23.160
I'm just average.

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:25.360
I wouldn't dare dream that big.

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:27.040
Why not?

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:29.800
You're pretty good-looking.

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:32.440
You can be a handsome streamer.

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:33.560
Besides,

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:35.840
I'm happy you're moving up.

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:37.200
What do you think?

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:40.560
Well, the planning team mentioned it,

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:41.440
but I told them

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:43.560
I'm your assistant

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:44.640
streamer.

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:47.320
Whatever look

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:49.160
you need me to do, I'll nail it.

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:49.720
Right?

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:51.440
Yeah?

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:53.680
The other side.

00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:56.080
What did the clients say?

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:58.120
The clients said

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:00.160
my current style

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:01.600
is a bit too much.

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:02.360
It's just

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:04.520
not up to their

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:05.680
level.

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:12.840
I'm happy for you.

00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:16.080
People should always aim higher.

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:18.000
Let's push each other.

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:19.640
That's good. Keep it up.

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:21.280
Thanks, Anran.

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:25.920
Xiaohe, help me find someone

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:27.640
who's good at

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:29.520
livening up the live stream vibe,

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:31.960
a funny assistant streamer.

00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:34.880
Anran, I'm just

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:36.960
doing a couple of ads.

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:38.840
I can still be your assistant.

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:40.440
Don't worry.

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:42.200
I'm not replacing you.

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:44.800
You'll still be in my live stream.

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:45.880
I just need

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:47.040
someone to be funny

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:48.520
to hype up the vibe.

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:49.160
Okay?

00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:53.280
Okay.

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:55.880
I'm on call anytime.

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:04.080
Did you hear what I said just now?

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:06.240
I was tallying invoices.

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:07.400
Please say it again?

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:12.040
What's wrong with you?

00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:13.080
Why do you always

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:14.920
live in your own bubble?

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.440
Xiaojian and I were talking

00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:18.800
about finding a new

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:20.840
funny streamer

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:22.160
who can liven things up

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:23.680
to be my assistant

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.160
streamer.

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:26.000
Who's good for this?

00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:28.200
Miss Liao?

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:30.560
She's been doing well lately.

00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:31.760
Totally letting loose.

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:33.640
Miss Liao?

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:36.120
The pole dancer?

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:36.760
Way too low-end.

00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:37.640
She's not fit for

00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:38.800
Anran's live stream at all.

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:40.160
It's not that

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:40.960
she's low-end.

00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:43.600
Miss Liao just talks too much.

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:44.240
Find someone else.

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:47.240
Wait, what kind of logic is that?

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:48.760
How did you think of Miss Liao?

00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:49.680
Think again.

00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:53.120
Zhang Ran.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.200
Desperate Personal Shopper.

00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:56.680
Her stats are pretty good lately.

00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:58.640
Just holds back a bit.

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:02.200
Zhang Ran? Holds back?

00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:05.360
I think Zhang Ran is quite cute.

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:07.240
Zhang Ran's not bad.

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:08.480
She's pretty funny.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.480
Zhang Ran works, right?

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:12.400
Okay.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.640
Go tell Zhang Ran

00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:16.400
that my livestream room

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:17.640
needs more fun lately.

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:18.760
And I really like her.

00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:21.800
See if she gets what I mean.

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:23.200
Okay.

00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:31.760
Anran, have some fruit.

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:33.120
Call me if you need anything.

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:34.160
I'm on standby.

00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:36.120
You're feeling the pressure, huh?

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:39.080
Don't be afraid.

00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:40.440
I'll still have your back.

00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:47.640
You must know

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:48.800
this brand, Ran.

00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:50.120
It's about one-stop shopping.

00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:52.000
Here's Anran's live stream plan:

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.320
you model the fake clothes'

00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:55.880
fabric and fit,

00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:58.240
wear them

00:12:58.240 --> 00:12:59.920
with messy styling.

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:01.240
Based on that,

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:01.960
Anran will step in,

00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:03.000
re-style with real ones,

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:04.120
and show

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:05.360
the final vibe.

00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:07.480
The point is to show

00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:09.000
real vs fake differences

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:10.600
and her styling tricks.

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:11.240
Got it.

00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:13.000
You wanna use Ran as a contrast?

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:16.080
It's okay, no problem.

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:16.920
It's easy.

00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:18.160
As long as I can help Anran

00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:19.600
sell the clothes well.

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:20.280
It's all good.

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:24.920
You okay with that?

00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:26.640
Yeah, let's go.

00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:28.520
Okay.

00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:05.960
So many clothes.

00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:08.000
From the company,

00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:09.360
they want me to wear them

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:10.880
on Lin Anran's live stream.

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:15.040
Thanks.

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:19.320
Give it to me.

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:27.200
You said

00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:29.560
you'd buy me a

00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:30.760
higher pillow.

00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:32.880
Are you

00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:34.920
still gonna buy it?

00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:38.400
Yeah, I'll buy it online

00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:40.720
and have it shipped home.

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:48.840
Mr. Zhu said the busy season is coming.

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:50.840
If I go back now,

00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:52.800
the past year won't be for nothing.

00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:54.760
Earn what I can.

00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:06.400
You won't change your phone number, huh?

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:08.240
Huh?

00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:10.560
Your phone number. Changing it?

00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:13.640
Why would I change it?

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:15.240
Who knows.

00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:19.200
Wanna change yours?

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:19.960
I could, I guess.

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:25.600
It's okay, we still have email.

00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:34.000
- I bought the ticket.
- Did you buy the ticket?

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:42.120
Okay.

00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:46.680
Okay.

00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:54.560
Let me help you.

00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:55.040
Leave it.

00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:55.800
I'll do it.

00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:00.760
Just leave it there.

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:14.080
Time for bed.

00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:24.280
Want some water?

00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:24.800
No.

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:25.640
Give me your phone.

00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:26.240
I'll charge it for you.

00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:26.920
I'll do it myself.

00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:02.200
You got something to say?

00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:04.319
When did you get scraped here?

00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:07.560
It's been a week. It's fine now.

00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:12.280
Let me dab some iodine on it.

00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:12.839
No need.

00:17:13.839 --> 00:17:15.400
It's already healed.

00:17:16.319 --> 00:17:16.880
Just a sec.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.640
I'm okay, Fu Yudong!

00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:29.240
I said no, it's fine now.

00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:32.600
It's better to be safe.

00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:36.920
Be good.

00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:37.640
I won't.

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:42.240
After I leave,

00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:45.200
you need to take care of yourself.

00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:48.120
You're not a kid anymore.

00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:50.480
Call me anytime if you need anything.

00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:51.320
I don't want it.

00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:04.480
I'm not dying, you know.

00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:10.240
I scraped it a week ago, why ask now?

00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:11.920
It's already healed, and here you are

00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:13.680
scrambling to put iodine on it.

00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:15.920
You didn't tell me.

00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:17.320
Weren't you paying attention?

00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:18.680
Can't you see?

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:20.680
You always wear long sleeves.

00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:24.480
Alright, alright.

00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:25.600
It's my fault.

00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:28.000
Just be more careful.

00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:28.880
What about the other side?

00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:30.440
No. I'm fine.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:31.680
Let me check.

00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:32.360

00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:46.640
My heart.

00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:48.760
I'll spray some medicine on it.

00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:50.240
Come here.

00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:51.280
Quit messing with me.

00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:57.000

00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:15.880
[is causing a jam.]

00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:17.280
[Lucheng Radio]

00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:18.680
[reminds all drivers]

00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:19.800
[to please detour.]

00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:24.400
Anran.

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:26.040
I left early today,

00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:27.640
but there's an accident ahead.

00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:28.320
I might be stuck

00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:29.640
for a little while here.

00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:30.800
I won't miss the

00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:31.480
official start time,

00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:33.360
but I might be

00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:34.840
a bit late for rehearsal.

00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:36.440
I'll get there as soon as I can.

00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:38.080
Sorry, really sorry.

00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:51.280
Okay.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:59.120
Sir, is this the only road

00:19:59.120 --> 00:19:59.760
to get there?

00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:01.040
Yeah, only this road.

00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:05.240
No way around here? Crap.

00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:13.560
Here.

00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:15.280
Okay.

00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:20.600
Director Zhou, yours.

00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:22.960
Dr. Fu, yours.

00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:24.680
This pair is mine.

00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:27.200
Ran's not coming back.

00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:28.960
I grabbed an extra.

00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:29.800
The serving pair then.

00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:31.360
What an excuse.

00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:33.200
Serving chopsticks, huh?

00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:34.320
It's cleaner.

00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:36.320
Other countries all do separate servings.

00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:37.960
But that's abroad.

00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:39.440
We're in China now.

00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:40.320
And we're at home.

00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:42.200
Yudong's going back

00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:43.600
to Canada soon.

00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:47.720
Why bring that up?

00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:49.920
You want them to split up?

00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:54.480
No, I...I was talking about chopsticks,

00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:55.280
and you...

00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:57.960
I'll take this call.

00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:01.920
What were you talking about?

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:02.720
Didn't you say

00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:03.880
you'd persuade him?

00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:06.000
Alright, keep it down.

00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:13.920
Okay,

00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:15.600
I'm heading over now.

00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:25.040
Mom, Dad,

00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:26.480
something came up.

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:27.280
I gotta go.

00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:28.520
Don't wait for me.

00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:30.320
What's so urgent?

00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:31.880
At least eat first.

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:32.880
Fu Yong...

00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:37.280
My dad, had a heart attack.

00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:38.560
He's at the city hospital.

00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:39.560
I need to go see him.

00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:41.000
Okay, then...

00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:43.120
Don't just stand here.

00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:44.240
Quick, let's change and go.

00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:44.600
Okay.

00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:45.480
No, no, don't.

00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:45.880
We'll go with you.

00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:46.760
You don't have to.

00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:47.560
It might not be serious.

00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:50.760
Heart attacks are

00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:53.120
common emergencies.

00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:55.840
It might not be a big deal.

00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:56.840
Well...

00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:58.560
Hey, your shoes.

00:21:58.560 --> 00:21:59.640
Yeah, shoes.

00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:00.520
Change your shoes.

00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:00.960
Okay.

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:02.480
Let me.

00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:03.600
Just stay calm.

00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:04.200
Got it.

00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:06.360
Call us if anything happens,

00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:07.360
and we'll come.

00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:08.840
It's fine.

00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:10.000
Got your phone?

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:10.560
Yes.

00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:11.800
You go ahead.

00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:13.840
I'm going now.

00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:15.400
Let us

00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:15.640
know

00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:16.840
how things are, okay?

00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:17.800
Sure.

00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:30.240
We haven't even met his dad yet.

00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:33.000
Hope it's not too late.

00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:36.560
Hey! Don't jinx it!

00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:42.240
Heart attacks are common now?

00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:45.680
Don't leave preventive meds

00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:46.720
in the drawer.

00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:48.320
Keep some with you.

00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:52.960
Okay.

00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:02.160
Hello, Mom. What's up?

00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:03.600
[Where are you?]

00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:05.200
[Has Yudong]

00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:06.120
[called you?]

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:08.880
[His dad's rushed to the hospital. Heart attack.]

00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:10.160
What?

00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:11.080
What's going on?

00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:12.040
How is he now?

00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:13.280
I don't know. Nobody told me.

00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:14.960
[Didn't Yudong tell you?]

00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:16.600
[What was he thinking? Listen,]

00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:17.680
[drop whatever]

00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:18.440
[you're doing]

00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:19.240
[and head to the hospital now.]

00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:20.480
[If you need anything,]

00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:21.760
[tell me and your dad.]

00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:23.080
[We've got savings.]

00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:24.240
[We can withdraw money anytime.]

00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:24.800
[Got it?]

00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:25.880
Yeah, got it.

00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:27.120
Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:27.880
Gotta go.

00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:46.640
Why's it taking so long?

00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:00.960
It's okay.

00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:03.760
They brought him back.

00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:05.880
It was scary in the ambulance.

00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:07.560
The paramedics said his heart

00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:09.120
stopped for a bit.

00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:11.000
Daoqi.

00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:11.880
He almost...

00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:12.400
Li Daoqi.

00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:13.920
Sit down.

00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:14.960
I was just making

00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:15.480
a joke

00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:16.520
so he could relax a bit.

00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:17.520
Stop talking nonsense.

00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:23.680
Last night Yongjun

00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:25.240
said his chest

00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:26.040
hurt.

00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:27.080
I told him

00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:28.200
see a doctor right away

00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:29.320
to have a check-up,

00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:30.760
but he didn't listen.

00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:33.160
It's hard to

00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:34.680
see such things coming.

00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:36.080
It's your fault.

00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:36.880
Don't blame yourself.

00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:20.800
[Anran,]

00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:22.280
[I'm so sorry.]

00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:24.320
[I can't make it today.]

00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:26.560
[My father-in-law had an acute heart attack]

00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:27.840
[and is in the ER.]

00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:29.880
[I have to be at the hospital.]

00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:31.400
Sorry to

00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:32.920
cause you so much trouble.

00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:34.360
I'll make it up to you when I get back.

00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:35.040
[I'm so sorry.]

00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:35.920
[I really, really am.]

00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:43.440
[I've told Xiaohe about this, and you'll]

00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:45.880
[see my messages after the livestream ends.]

00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:47.000
Sorry, Anran.

00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:03.160
Actually...

00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:05.120
What?

00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:07.920
Actually, if you're busy with work,

00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:08.680
you don't

00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:09.840
have to waste time here.

00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:21.000
Nonsense. Just go back.

00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:40.200
Ms. Wang.

00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:30.280
Why didn't you save my Mom?

00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:31.520
Yudong...

00:27:56.720 --> 00:27:58.200
The doctor said your dad needs

00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:00.160
someone with him around the clock.

00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:02.160
I'm taking my Mom back to get some things.

00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:04.160
Man needs to go back to look after Nian.

00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:05.680
You stay with him.

00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:07.560
Ran still has work.

00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:09.440
Who says I have work?

00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:15.280
We'll be quick.

00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:16.640
No need to come back.

00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:17.400
Just rest at home.

00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:18.920
We two will stay here.

00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:20.880
I talked to my Mom.

00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:22.320
She refused.

00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:23.880
She insists on staying here tonight.

00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:28.080
Let's go.

00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:34.240
We're here. Don't worry.

00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:44.280
Why still standing? Sit.

00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:45.400
Sit down.

00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:08.680
Your wife has been bedridden

00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:10.760
for years.

00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:12.560
[Honestly,]

00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:14.320
[no quality life to speak of.]

00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:17.840
So

00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:18.840
I think we need to

00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:20.320
discuss with you

00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:23.040
whether to keep her on life support.

00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:24.200
[Think it over]

00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:25.760
[and make a decision.]

00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:47.080
I...I've been thinking about this,

00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:52.080
but still want to ask you.

00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:55.240
[If you agree to stop treatment,]

00:30:57.280 --> 00:30:58.680
blink twice.

00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:04.760
[If you don't,]

00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:07.280
[blink three times.]

00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:15.120
Ling?

00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:27.360
[Ling...]

00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:53.480
[He's awake. He moved.]

00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:54.320
[Yudong.]

00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:55.680
[Come over. He's awake.]

00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:01.520
[Dad,]

00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:03.520
[I'm Zhang Ran,]

00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:05.280
[Yudong's wife.]

00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:07.360
[We've met on video before.]

00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:10.200
[Ms. Wang and Daoqi went home]

00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:11.200
[to get things.]

00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:12.280
[They'll be right back.]

00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:14.320
[The doctor said]

00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:15.840
[to take this off once you wake up.]

00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:17.640
[Would you like some water?]

00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:08.800
Why are the lights...

00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:11.840
Are they back?

00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:13.320
Mom, Dad.

00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:14.280
We've been waiting for you.

00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:15.320
How is everything?

00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:16.760
Nothing serious.

00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:17.800
Out of danger now.

00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:18.760
Just wait

00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:20.520
[for the hospital to schedule]

00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:21.720
[the bypass surgery.]

00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:24.040
He's okay.

00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:25.400
Good to hear that.

00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:26.880
How old is your dad?

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:27.840
65.

00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:30.280
A bit younger than me.

00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:31.680
Just go to bed. Go on.

00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:32.400
It's late.

00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:33.640
You should be sleeping.

00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:35.320
Alright. Listen,

00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:37.320
[it's good you two came back from abroad.]

00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:38.880
When parents get older,

00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:40.200
having children nearby

00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:41.480
brings peace of mind.

00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:42.360
Enough.

00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:43.640
They were at the hospital all day.

00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:44.880
Go get some rest.

00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:45.600
[Don't worry about us.]

00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:46.520
[Go to sleep, quick.]

00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:47.440
[Okay.]

00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:48.640
[There's hot water.]

00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:49.760
Got it.

00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:50.520
Go to sleep now.

00:34:52.159 --> 00:34:53.000
Need to charge your phone?

00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:54.080
No.

00:34:55.480 --> 00:34:56.080
Just plug it in.

00:34:56.080 --> 00:34:56.679
It's full.

00:34:58.560 --> 00:34:59.720
But it won't last the whole night.

00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:12.800
What did Daoqi say to you?

00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:21.880
Is it about your dad?

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:23.560
No.

00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:37.720
I canceled my flight back to Canada.

00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:45.480
Refund fee costs over 2,000 yuan.

00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:53.880
I'll cover it.

00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:55.560
What?

00:35:56.480 --> 00:35:57.360
I'll cover it.

00:35:57.640 --> 00:35:58.400
What?

00:35:58.800 --> 00:35:59.560
The ticket price.

00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:19.400
Yudong, look.

00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:20.600
Is that a shooting star?

00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:22.960
Another one.

00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:24.960
Make another wish.

00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:31.840
I did.

00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:32.720
What is it?

00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:35.880
I hope I can

00:36:37.830 --> 00:36:38.760
[protect my family.]

00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:54.320
Luckily, Xinying's

00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:56.240
always

00:36:56.360 --> 00:36:58.240
listened to me.

00:36:59.320 --> 00:37:00.640
It'll save her

00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:02.360
from trial and error.

00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:03.520
She smoothly

00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:06.000
landed a job at a Canadian bank.

00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:08.080
Not like my sister's daughter.

00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:09.160
She's

00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:11.200
too stubborn.

00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:12.720
I could tell ever since she was little.

00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:15.320
A while back, she tried reselling

00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:18.160
yet became a total joke.

00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:20.680
I thought the whole thing

00:37:20.680 --> 00:37:22.080
would soon be over,

00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:23.840
but guess what?

00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:26.880
That young lady

00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:28.680
is planning

00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:31.280
to do

00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:33.440
livestreaming sales.

00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:35.560
Livestreaming.

00:37:36.080 --> 00:37:37.000
What is it?

00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:40.440
[Is she the one]

00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:42.120
[who used to]

00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:43.440
[be a TV host?]

00:37:45.560 --> 00:37:46.480
That's her.

00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:49.200
[Called Desperate Personal Shopper?]

00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:50.360
[Manfei showed me]

00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:51.480
[the other day,]

00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:53.360
[saying she's really popular.]

00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:54.960
You've watched her livestreams?

00:37:55.120 --> 00:37:56.720
You call that popular?

00:37:57.320 --> 00:37:59.400
That's just a disgrace.

00:38:00.120 --> 00:38:01.600
[Well, she definitely can't]

00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:02.640
[compare to Xinying.]

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.880
[Xinying works at Royal Bank]

00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:07.400
[of Canada,]

00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:08.160
[right?]

00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:10.400
[No ordinary people]

00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:11.400
[can work there.]

00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:14.840
Well, I can't

00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:17.120
talk this too much in front of

00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:17.880
my sister,

00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:19.680
in case she'd be awkward.

00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:21.880
She is too proud

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:23.040
and just

00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:24.240
has to win.

00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:26.840
At first,

00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:28.520
Xinying's grades weren't

00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:30.800
as good as Ran's for a while.

00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:33.680
But everything has

00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:34.760
changed now.

00:38:35.080 --> 00:38:36.560
Look at Xinying,

00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:37.920
and look what Ran ended up.

00:38:38.760 --> 00:38:39.760
[Exactly.]

00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:41.720
[You've finally made it through.]

00:38:42.200 --> 00:38:44.040
[During the six years of caring for Xinying,]

00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:47.480
[the whole family nearly broke up.]

00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:51.240
Those years

00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:55.160
were just too hard.

00:38:56.440 --> 00:38:57.240
[Indeed.]

00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:01.080
[Has Lu been behaving lately?]

00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:02.760
Lu Ming?

00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:06.240
He's fine.

00:39:08.120 --> 00:39:09.800
[What about that Sunny]

00:39:10.040 --> 00:39:11.320
[Butterfly?]

00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:12.360
[No more contact?]

00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:16.280
Why are you so nosy?

00:39:16.840 --> 00:39:18.320
I've noticed you bring this up

00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:19.640
more than I do.

00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:21.560
And, it

00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:24.200
doesn't prove anything.

00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:26.320
[Seriously?]

00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:27.600
[Listen up,]

00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:28.400
[he just]

00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:29.600
[won't admit it.]

00:39:30.120 --> 00:39:31.320
[That's how men are.]

00:39:31.520 --> 00:39:32.840
[Unless you catch them red-handed,]

00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:34.440
[or they'll never confess.]

00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:36.440
[Then if you scold him,]

00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:37.320
[he acts like]

00:39:37.560 --> 00:39:38.280
[he's wronged]

00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:39.680
[and talks even louder than you.]

00:39:42.120 --> 00:39:43.640
At our age,

00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:45.160
every family

00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:46.760
has its own mess.

00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:48.720
Xinying's grown up.

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:51.280
I wanna

00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:53.640
keep this marriage,

00:39:53.640 --> 00:39:54.560
just get by

00:39:54.760 --> 00:39:56.080
and let some things go.

00:39:58.960 --> 00:39:59.840
[Yeah.]

00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:04.760
I tell you something.

00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:06.040
Don't tell anyone else.

00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:07.440
[Okay, go ahead.]

00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:12.520
I've noticed

00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:16.280
when Lu uses his phone,

00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:17.880
he sometimes unlocks it

00:40:17.880 --> 00:40:19.000
with one finger

00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:20.880
and sometimes

00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:22.600
switches to a different finger.

00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:25.360
[So I looked it up online]

00:40:26.040 --> 00:40:27.840
[and found something weird.]

00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:29.840
[You know what that means?]

00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:33.000
[One fingerprint controls one account.]

00:40:33.240 --> 00:40:34.680
[Basically, one fingerprint]

00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:36.120
[manages one system.]

00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:38.320
[Super secretive.]

00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:41.200
[Safer than using two phones.]

00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:42.560
[Hard to discover.]

00:40:43.160 --> 00:40:43.920
[Don't you think]

00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:45.160
[there's something fishy going on?]

00:40:46.440 --> 00:40:47.840
I just want to tell you,

00:40:48.320 --> 00:40:49.360
this is a trick.

00:40:49.720 --> 00:40:50.600
None of these men

00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:51.880
nowadays are easy to deal with.

00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:53.560
[Have you gotten any evidence?]

00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:55.640
[You need to have solid proof]

00:40:56.040 --> 00:40:57.440
[and then confront him.]

00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:04.160
I know.

00:41:04.160 --> 00:41:06.040
[You need to take it seriously.]

00:41:06.040 --> 00:41:07.040
Okay, okay.

00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:08.000
Gotta go.

00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:08.600
[Alright.]

00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:09.200
[Bye.]

00:41:16.120 --> 00:41:16.840
Evidence?

00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:35.640
What? You startled me.

00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:42.400
What's wrong?

00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:57.560
Hello, honey?

00:41:57.840 --> 00:41:58.560
[What's up?]

00:41:59.520 --> 00:42:00.440
What are you doing?

00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:03.080
I...I'm at work.

00:42:04.920 --> 00:42:06.120
[I'm near your office.]

00:42:06.440 --> 00:42:07.880
[Wanna grab lunch together?]

00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:09.800
I...I'm not at the office

00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:10.400
right now.

00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:11.360
I'm out

I've been waiting

00:42:53.120 --> 00:42:54.000

Hello?

00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:12.920
[Dad, I'm at Lucheng Plaza]

[waiting for a ride.]

00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:15.160
[Can you pick me up?]

00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:17.560
Sure, on my way.

00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:19.280
I'm nearby.

00:43:20.360 --> 00:43:20.960

I'm changing my destination.

00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:42.480
The black Volvo?

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:43.440
Right.

00:43:43.600 --> 00:43:44.240
Okay.
