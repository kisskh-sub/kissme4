[Reborn from the Ashes]

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.440
[Episode 8]

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.550
This is our bridal chamber.

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.510
You dared to kill me.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.920
That was an accident. I never meant to.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:24.880
Woman,

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:26.840
you're not being honest.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.360
I clearly pushed him off the cliff.
Why is he unharmed?

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:38.510
I...

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.510
I was just too scared.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.440
At the cliff,

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:44.960
I saw the silver spear on your chest.

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.670
Startled, I pushed you.

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:51.960
I didn't expect you to actually fall.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.920
Didn't you say you couldn't see it
before?

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.230
That day at the Begonia House,

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.630
I saw it clearly.

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.000
That scene terrified me,

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:02.840
so I stayed silent and hid the truth.

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:06.190
Since you can see it,

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.670
then help me pull it out.

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:14.230
I'm not lying to you.

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.110
I really can see it.

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:18.800
But I can't reach it.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:21.550
It's right here.

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.710
Only she can see this spear.

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:26.670
Maybe one day

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:28.880
she will be able to help me pull it out.

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:33.150
What are you doing?

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.150
This poison

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.000
flairs up once every month.

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.070
If you behave well,

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.320
I'll give you the antidote on time.

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.230
But if you speak out of turn,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.760
or do what you shouldn't,

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:49.590
then

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:53.480
hell will welcome you.

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:02.280
Young Master.

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:03.480
Well?

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:05.010
Just as you expected,

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:06.480
after you ran away from the wedding,

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:07.710
the Prince was extremely angry.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.370
Wanyan Jin actually took the initiative
to marry Su Qingran.

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:13.070
I intentionally reported
until after their wedding night.

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.920
You're saying Wanyan Jin

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.480
took initiative to propose
to marry Su Qingran.

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:18.550
Yes.

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.550
That caught me by surprise.

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:21.670
However,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.280
since their fate is sealed,

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.030
let's return now.

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.190
I want Father to help me

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.000
to formally propose
to the Su Family again.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.710
This time, no one will stop me from
marrying Yi.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.110
Your Highness,

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:39.840
on the wedding day,

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.200
[Prince Zhenbei's Mansion Hall]
the bride actually ran off with a man.

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.760
Isn't this a slap in the face to us?

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.840
And Jin.

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:48.550
He even brought such a woman

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.440
back to the Mansion

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.550
and secretly held a ceremonial wedding
with her.

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:54.000
Alright.

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.360
You don't need to say anything more
about this.

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.840
Jin has already told me everything
that happened.

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.670
Isn't what he did a disgrace
to the Mansion?

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:07.400
In my opinion,

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.000
he never truly cared
about the Mansion.

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:12.360
He actually did the right thing.

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.400
He did this for the greater good,

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.840
though it was a grievance for him

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.440
to enter into such a marriage.

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.030
Your Highness, this concerns
the reputation of the Mansion.

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.030
How can you be so biased towards him?

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.960
Could it be that

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:29.500
you want me to protect

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:31.490
that rebellious son
who fled at the last minute?

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:33.630
If you have time for that,

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:35.320
you'd better think carefully

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.440
about how to discipline your son.

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:38.710
No matter what,

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.030
I refuse to accept this marriage.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.410
Last night, we finished the ceremony

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:46.610
and consummated our marriage.

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.590
Mother, you have to accept it.

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:52.190
Pay my respects to you, Father, Mother.

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:54.440
Why are you wearing a veil?

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.920
Do you still have us in your eyes?

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.550
Yesterday, she was abducted by someone.

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:01.990
It's not proper for her
to be seen right now.

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.760
She is also afraid of offending you.

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.030
That's why she wears the veil.

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:10.070
So I was just overthinking.

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.800
Su Qingran, from now on,
you will be the crown princess.

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.000
Take good care of Jin,

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.480
and always remember your status.

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:19.190
Enough.

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:20.590
From now on,

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:21.920
we are one family.

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:24.280
Just stop preaching here.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.280
The bride will offer tea.

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.000
Father.

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:36.590
For such a corrupt official,

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:39.710
I will personally supervise
the execution.

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.000
It's a proven fact

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.250
that the criminal Wen Muchen
poisoned the Qilin Army.

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:46.070
His crimes are unforgivable.

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:47.210
Carry out the execution.

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:00.440
You vile woman!

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:03.030
Reflect carefully here.

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:04.700
[Memorial Tablet of Wen Muchen]

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:19.400
Why are you...

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.590
Mother, who do you think I am?

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:25.880
Mind your behavior.

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:28.920
Your Highness, forgive me.
I was mistaken.

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:33.510
Since the tea is too hot,
why not let it cool down?

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:35.190
That brat,

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:40.190
after gaining recognition,
he no longer takes me seriously.

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:42.480
Your Highness,

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:44.070
Young Master Qi has returned.

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:46.000
He dares to come back again?

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:51.550
Father, Mother.

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:55.320
I know I have caused trouble.

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:57.710
I ask you to punish me.

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:01.550
Qi, what you did was indeed wrong
this time.

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:05.800
But Jin and Ran look well-matched.

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:09.320
It was a twist of fate
that brought about a good marriage.

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:11.440
Though your merits
outweigh your mistakes,

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:13.110
you must still accept punishment.

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:16.360
Qi, hurry and apologize
to your sister-in-law.

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.360
Bad bamboo never grows good shoots.

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:21.480
Wanyan Qi has caused such a big mess.

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:24.400
She thinks a simple apology
will put everything to rest.

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:26.670
I refuse to let things go that easily.

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:28.320
I am willing to apologize to you.

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:31.360
How do you intend to apologize?

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:48.800
Your way of making an apology
is quite unique.

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:50.030
Qi,

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:52.360
how could you be so disrespectful
to Qingran?

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:55.000
Qi must also think

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:56.950
that it was improper
for the bride to serve tea

00:06:56.970 --> 00:06:58.070
while wearing a veil

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:01.110
and not showing her true face.

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:02.960
There's no outsider present now,

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:06.400
so why not just lift the veil?

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:08.360
Yes, Mother.

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:10.190
That was exactly my thought just now.

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:11.320
Since Qingran

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:13.390
has married into the family,
she is now one of us,

00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:15.030
and appearing with a veil

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:17.190
seems a bit distant.

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:19.190
If you're so eager to see my face,

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:21.110
then I'll show it to you.

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:22.400
But,

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:24.710
please don't be afraid.

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:35.150
You...

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:37.000
This is impossible.

00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:40.320
How could you possibly still be alive?

00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:43.880
Why does she look so much
like Wen Yueqian?

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:45.030
Indeed.

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:47.670
I was never supposed to survive.

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:51.070
Are you here to demand my life?

00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:53.960
On my wedding day, I was abducted.

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:56.230
If it weren't for his arrival,

00:07:56.590 --> 00:07:58.230
I might not have survived.

00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:00.840
Qi, no need to be so tense.

00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:03.960
Even if you ran off
and brought me shame,

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:07.510
I wouldn't come here
to demand your life.

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:10.550
My wife only has a small cut
on her face.

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:13.800
Is it really necessary for you
to react this strongly?

00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:14.960
Impossible!

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:17.190
How could there be someone so alike?

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:18.470
Father,

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:20.230
she must be that vile woman.

00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:22.350
Your Highness,

00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:25.310
I don't understand
why Qi says this about me,

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:27.840
even going so far as to insult me.

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:30.840
This woman knows how to stir trouble.

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:32.310
Qi,

00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:34.960
she is already my wife.

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:37.270
How can you insult her like this?

00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:38.880
Father,

00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:41.560
you must stand up for Qingran.

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:42.680
You rebellious son!

00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:45.680
You reneged on the marriage
you begged for.

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:47.840
If Jin hadn't stepped in on time,

00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:50.430
you've completely made me lose face.

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:52.680
Now you're still humiliating Qingran.

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:53.720
Someone!

00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:55.230
Take him away.

00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:57.470
Flog him 20 times.

00:08:57.640 --> 00:08:58.430
Father, I was wrong.

00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:00.560
Go kneel in the ancestral hall
for three days.

00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:01.390
Reflect carefully.

00:09:01.390 --> 00:09:01.940
Your Highness.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:02.840
You can't do that.

00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:04.350
Qi is quite frail.

00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:05.110
20 lashes,

00:09:05.110 --> 00:09:06.520
he won't be able to endure that.

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:07.840
I've heard,

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:10.550
that Prince Zhenbei's Mansion
has very strict family rules.

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.270
It truly lives up to the reputation.

00:09:12.310 --> 00:09:13.390
Qi has become like this now,

00:09:13.390 --> 00:09:14.640
all because you spoiled him.

00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:16.470
If you dare to plead again,

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:17.800
I'll add 20 more lashes.

00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:20.270
It's all because of this jinx.

00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:23.640
Ever since she married into the Mansion,
the household has been in turmoil.

00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:24.960
Father, Mother,

00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:26.230
if there's nothing else,

00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:27.680
we will take our leave first.

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:30.070
Go ahead.

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:32.960
Everything

00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:35.270
has just begun.

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:44.440
[The Crown Prince's Courtyard]

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:50.720
Come here.

00:09:58.070 --> 00:09:59.520
You really hold grudges.

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:01.000
You poisoned me last night,

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.880
and punish me to dig lotus roots
for you today.

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:05.190
You're overthinking.

00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:08.030
I just want to eat the lotus roots
you dug yourself.

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:19.310
You've offended
Princess Zhenbei and Wanyan Qi.

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:21.390
Aren't you worried
they'll come after you?

00:10:22.110 --> 00:10:24.070
Aren't you the one who offended them?

00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:27.190
You really cleared the way cleanly.

00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:30.640
Aren't you enjoying it just as much?

00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:36.230
They seem quite fearful of your looks.

00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:37.880
The world is vast.

00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:40.920
It's no surprise two people
can look alike.

00:10:41.270 --> 00:10:42.470
If that's the case,

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:45.600
then I won't be helping you anymore.

00:10:46.030 --> 00:10:46.960
Your Highness,

00:10:47.270 --> 00:10:49.350
don't be so absolute with your words.

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:50.880
Or else,

00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:53.560
you will lose face.

00:10:54.390 --> 00:10:55.680
Don't forget,

00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:57.150
your life

00:10:57.350 --> 00:10:58.840
is in my hands.

00:10:59.310 --> 00:11:01.110
If I die,

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:04.110
no one would help you
pull the spear for you.

00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:12.030
My Lord,

00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:13.000
we've found it.

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:15.270
The woman Wanyan Qi married before

00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:18.390
was Wen Yueqian, the only daughter
of former Governor Wen Muchen.

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:20.560
After Wen Muchen was executed,

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:22.800
Wen Yueqian mysteriously fell ill
and died.

00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:24.470
Wen Yueqian...

00:11:25.270 --> 00:11:27.000
Qianyue.

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:29.190
Yueqian.
