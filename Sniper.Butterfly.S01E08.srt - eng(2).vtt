- Hello, who are you looking for?
- Hello.

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:00.330
Sorry about that.

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:01.777
This is the company's new project,

00:02:01.777 --> 00:02:02.930
so I thought I'd try one.

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:03.890
I forgot to take it off.

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:05.210
I'm Cen Jin.

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.050
I'm here to...

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.690
Cen Jin?

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.100
I know you.
You're the new creative director!

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.010
I'm Lu Tong, a designer.

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:12.170
I've seen your work.

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.780
It's amazing.

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.890
Thank you.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.610
I'll show you around,

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:16.780
and then we'll go find HR.

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:17.130
Sure.

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.622
Let's go.

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:20.890
This whole area back here

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.380
is the staff workspace.

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:23.220
And...

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:25.890
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:28.780
They just pulled an all-nighter.

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.450
Our work hours are flexible.

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:31.690
Once you finish your work,

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:32.570
you can leave anytime.

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.570
Okay.

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:34.010
This way.

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:36.570
Here's the treadmill.

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.410
This is coffee. The relaxation area.

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:39.410
If you

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:40.730
get stuck on ideas,

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:41.570
you can come here

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:43.450
to unwind and look for inspiration.

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.570
Nice.

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.450
Cen Jin?

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.980
You're here.

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:48.290
I just arrived.

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:49.844
I haven't done my onboarding yet.

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:51.100
Great timing.

00:02:51.244 --> 00:02:52.329
Do the paperwork later.

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:53.777
Let's have a creative meeting first.

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.410
Guys, stop playing.

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:57.466
We have a meeting now.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:58.290
Lu Tong, you too.

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:00.100
Let's go.

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.890
Okay.

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:13.170
Cen Jin,

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.820
sit here.

00:03:14.266 --> 00:03:14.820
Sure.

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.780
Good.

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:24.450
Everyone's here.

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:25.340
We'll start.

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.130
Let me introduce you.

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:28.570
This is Cen Jin,

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:30.850
our new creative director.

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:32.340
Hello, everyone.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:35.890
Everyone here

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:37.170
will be working with you.

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:39.260
Lu Tong, introduce them to her

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:40.540
after the meeting.

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:44.850
Alright, today's meeting

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:45.780
is mainly

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:46.980
to share some good news

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:48.780
with you guys.

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:50.730
This time,

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:51.730
we've secured

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:53.610
the Ren Food Group's

00:03:54.644 --> 00:03:55.980
festive advertising project.

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:00.380
I know you're all excited.

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.010
The brand is well-known,

00:04:03.044 --> 00:04:03.890
the exposure is big,

00:04:04.022 --> 00:04:05.130
and the earnings are great.

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:06.100
It wasn't easy

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:07.260
to secure this deal.

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.690
But with a brand client like this,

00:04:09.955 --> 00:04:11.733
their expectations are extremely high.

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:13.730
We need to aim for perfection.

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:17.050
Luckily, Cen Jin was in charge
of their Mid-Autumn

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:18.688
new product advertisement last year.

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:20.700
She knows the brand well

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:22.170
and has more experience than we do.

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:24.050
So I'm handing

00:04:24.911 --> 00:04:26.810
the project over to you, okay?

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:28.810
No problem.

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:30.540
Jin, this is your desk.

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:31.370
Thank you.

00:04:35.977 --> 00:04:37.533
(Cen Jin, Creative Director)
Ms. Cen.

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:40.050
I've sent all the progress reports
and files

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:41.140
for the Ren Group project

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:42.340
to your email.

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.490
Sorry, you are?

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:48.410
Li Fei.

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:49.780
Creative Team A leader.

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.050
I was the one leading

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:53.220
the Ren Group project before.

00:04:53.288 --> 00:04:54.540
If you want to know anything,

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:55.170
you can ask me.

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:56.370
Okay.

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:59.340
Right, Ted wasn't happy

00:04:59.340 --> 00:04:59.980
with the slogans

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:00.911
we gave him earlier.

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:02.050
I heard

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:03.580
you're an expert in writing copy.

00:05:03.844 --> 00:05:05.377
Could you help revise them?

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:08.850
I'll adjust them based
on the overall picture.

00:05:10.177 --> 00:05:11.600
I look forward to it.

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:17.020
Ignore him.

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:18.810
He's just upset.

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:19.810
Before you came,

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:21.711
he thought he'd get
the director position.

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:22.580
He's probably

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:24.050
feeling a little down now.

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:25.370
But he's not a bad buy.

00:05:25.444 --> 00:05:26.490
He looks up to the strong.

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:28.290
Once he knows how good you are,

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:29.540
he won't act like this.

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:32.780
It's fine.
He's the straightforward kind.

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:33.290
It's good.

00:05:33.555 --> 00:05:34.955

00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:53.100
(To be born)

00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:54.300
(in a duck's nest,)

00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:56.300
(in a farmyard,)

00:10:56.890 --> 00:10:59.250
(is of no consequence to a bird,)

00:11:00.130 --> 00:11:03.180
(if it is hatched from a swan's egg.)

00:11:49.370 --> 00:11:51.890
(It was glorious out in the country.)

00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:53.820
(It was summer,)

00:11:54.370 --> 00:11:56.340
(and the cornfields were yellow,)

00:11:57.010 --> 00:11:58.980
(and the oats were green.)

00:11:59.730 --> 00:12:01.250
(The hay had been put up)

00:12:01.650 --> 00:12:04.060
(in stacks in the green meadows,)

00:12:05.370 --> 00:12:07.460
(and the stork went about)

00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:08.650
(on his long red legs...)

00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:15.130

(in a duck's nest,)

00:12:16.850 --> 00:12:18.010
(in a farmyard,)

00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:21.300
(is of no consequence to a bird,)

00:12:21.650 --> 00:12:24.650
(if it is hatched from a swan's egg.)

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:16.820
(Gin sends a friend request.)

00:13:22.850 --> 00:13:23.650
Not today.

00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:44.540
(Done)

00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:46.700

00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:47.620
(Sent)

00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:56.420
(Wu: I've accepted your friend request.
Let's chat now.)

00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:08.420
(Keep tomorrow free.)

00:14:08.422 --> 00:14:10.400
(I'm booking a doctor's appointment.)

00:14:17.644 --> 00:14:20.244
(Keep tomorrow free.
I'm booking a doctor's appointment.)

00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:34.955
(If you don't reply,
I'll take that as a yes.)

00:14:46.250 --> 00:14:46.770
Shen.

00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:47.850
Shen.

00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:50.730
You set up this gathering,

00:14:50.730 --> 00:14:51.650
picked the place,

00:14:51.650 --> 00:14:53.222
and now you're the first to run off?

00:14:53.244 --> 00:14:54.244
That's not cool.

00:14:54.244 --> 00:14:55.711
I've got a meeting tomorrow.

00:14:57.130 --> 00:14:57.850
You guys enjoy.

00:14:58.022 --> 00:14:59.170
We'll drink another day again.

00:14:59.177 --> 00:15:00.977
You said that yourself.
Drink again next time.

00:15:01.890 --> 00:15:02.940
Alright. Take care.

00:15:19.444 --> 00:15:21.244
(Chang Bar)
I'm also a friend of Li Wu.

00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:22.100
I'm Chun Chang.

00:15:22.250 --> 00:15:23.530
I run a bar nearby,

00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:24.420
called Chang.

00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:25.420
Come by sometime.

00:15:26.511 --> 00:15:27.822
Would you like some flowers?

00:15:40.650 --> 00:15:41.250
Madam,

00:15:42.130 --> 00:15:42.850
how much

00:15:42.850 --> 00:15:43.700
for all these?

00:15:44.010 --> 00:15:45.010
These are the leftovers.

00:15:45.610 --> 00:15:46.460
Give me fifty,

00:15:46.555 --> 00:15:47.700
and you can take them all.

00:15:48.066 --> 00:15:48.977
I'll scan your code.

00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:49.490
Okay.

00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:54.820
Take cash, Madam.

00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:55.688
I'll pay for him.

00:15:57.370 --> 00:15:59.010
Miss, you're not busy today?

00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:00.220
No.

00:16:01.770 --> 00:16:02.580
This QR code

00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:04.060
is linked to her son's WeChat.

00:16:04.370 --> 00:16:05.580
If you scan this,

00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:06.730
the money won't go to her.

00:16:07.770 --> 00:16:09.850
Miss, who are these flowers for?

00:16:10.044 --> 00:16:11.622
For him. He's the one buying them.

00:16:11.622 --> 00:16:12.044
Alright.

00:16:12.530 --> 00:16:13.220
Thank you.

00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:13.770
Sure.

00:16:16.650 --> 00:16:17.300
See you, Madam.

00:16:17.530 --> 00:16:18.420
See you.

00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:24.220
So, can I have

00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:25.100
your WeChat now?

00:16:25.333 --> 00:16:27.222
I mean, you have to
transfer money to me.

00:16:27.530 --> 00:16:28.300
You know,

00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:29.530
I never use payment codes

00:16:29.530 --> 00:16:30.610
with strangers.

00:16:36.730 --> 00:16:37.300
Shen.

00:16:37.650 --> 00:16:38.100
Shen.

00:16:38.650 --> 00:16:39.530
- Yiyang.
- Yiyang.

00:16:39.850 --> 00:16:40.580
You're still here?

00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:42.420
Perfect timing. We're thinking of

00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:43.940
going somewhere else for a second round.

00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:45.100
Since you haven't left yet,

00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:45.700
come with us.

00:16:45.755 --> 00:16:47.100
Yeah, Yiyang. What a coincidence.

00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:48.866
Why don't you join us
for another drink?

00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:50.460
I'll pass. You guys go ahead.

00:16:51.650 --> 00:16:52.850
Come on. Join us.

00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:54.490
You asked us to meet here,

00:16:54.490 --> 00:16:55.820
and now we've run into you,

00:16:55.866 --> 00:16:56.955
you're running to sneak off?

00:16:56.977 --> 00:16:58.340
Yeah. It's still early.

00:16:58.490 --> 00:16:59.340
Let's go, Yiyang.

00:16:59.340 --> 00:17:01.980
Also, I've some work stuff to ask you.

00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:02.940
We just met a bit ago,

00:17:03.088 --> 00:17:05.222
and now you're off to drink
with someone else?

00:17:06.844 --> 00:17:08.422
Aren't you going to introduce me?

00:17:10.250 --> 00:17:11.460
These are my colleagues.

00:17:11.577 --> 00:17:13.330
No wonder you were trying to escape.

00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:15.090
That's not cool.

00:17:15.860 --> 00:17:16.420
Hello.

00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:17.940
I'm Shen's colleague.

00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:18.860
Just call me Zhang Chi.

00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:19.620
Hello.

00:17:19.620 --> 00:17:20.290
I'm Chun Chang.

00:17:20.911 --> 00:17:21.822
Nice to meet you.

00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:24.570
You've never mentioned me at work?

00:17:28.490 --> 00:17:29.730
Well, we won't keep you then.

00:17:29.730 --> 00:17:30.940
We'll get going, Yiyang.

00:17:30.955 --> 00:17:32.380
Let's hang out together sometime. Bye.

00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:32.860
Sure.

00:17:39.530 --> 00:17:40.010
Thanks.

00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:41.900
Just that?

00:17:42.770 --> 00:17:43.980
I acted as your girlfriend

00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:45.010
for a few minutes.

00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:46.980
Getting your WeChat

00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:48.111
isn't too much to ask, right?

00:17:51.860 --> 00:17:56.220
(Shen Yiyang)

00:17:57.330 --> 00:17:58.140
Shen Yiyang?

00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:01.730
Is this your real name?

00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:02.460
Yes.

00:18:05.420 --> 00:18:06.770
This isn't a work account?

00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:07.940
No.

00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:12.620
Why are you around here?

00:18:13.330 --> 00:18:14.333
Is it because I told you

00:18:14.333 --> 00:18:15.900
I opened a bar here last time,

00:18:16.244 --> 00:18:17.577
and you came here to find me?

00:18:18.010 --> 00:18:19.010
Come in for a drink.

00:18:19.770 --> 00:18:20.330
I can't.

00:18:20.444 --> 00:18:22.133
I've got a meeting tomorrow morning.

00:18:24.250 --> 00:18:25.770
You're already here.

00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:26.900
The bar is right here.

00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:28.244
Let me treat you to a drink.

00:18:28.530 --> 00:18:29.180
I really can't.

00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:30.700
I'm going home to rest.

00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:33.490
You sleep so early.

00:18:36.770 --> 00:18:37.460
My ride's here.

00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:39.220
I'm off.

00:18:41.810 --> 00:18:43.090
I sent you a friend request.

00:18:43.090 --> 00:18:43.770
Accept it.

00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:46.660
You triggered my competitive spirit.

00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:40.700
(Gin invites you for a voice call)

00:20:59.290 --> 00:20:59.770
Hello?

00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:01.900
Hello?

00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:05.010
Are you free this morning?

00:21:05.511 --> 00:21:08.111
That doctor can only squeeze us in
during the morning.

00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:12.490
So sudden?

00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:15.770
His appointments are really hard to get.

00:21:15.770 --> 00:21:17.377
It took a lot for me to get this slot.

00:21:17.810 --> 00:21:18.940
If we go a bit earlier,

00:21:18.977 --> 00:21:20.711
we'll have more time to ask questions.

00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:24.250
Two of us?

00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:26.330
Yeah.

00:21:26.730 --> 00:21:28.050
Didn't I say I'd take you?

00:21:33.140 --> 00:21:33.810
Well,

00:21:35.066 --> 00:21:36.911
you're not going to work today?

00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:38.380
I took leave.

00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:40.770
My colleague will follow up
on the project.

00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:49.380
Unless today doesn't work for you,

00:21:50.490 --> 00:21:51.620
we can change the day.

00:21:52.530 --> 00:21:53.010
No.

00:21:54.490 --> 00:21:55.010
It's fine.

00:21:56.460 --> 00:21:57.010
Okay.

00:22:00.810 --> 00:22:01.490
But...

00:22:06.330 --> 00:22:09.420
I lent my car to Cheng Rui.

00:22:11.220 --> 00:22:12.660
I'll pick you up at the hotel.

00:22:13.460 --> 00:22:14.940
I should be there around nine.

00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:19.140
Okay.

00:23:29.133 --> 00:23:30.088
(I'm downstairs.)

00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:37.260
(Department of Neurology)

00:23:37.460 --> 00:23:39.490
Sorry. A patient came in just now.

00:23:39.644 --> 00:23:40.644
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:23:40.755 --> 00:23:41.311
It's fine.

00:23:41.770 --> 00:23:42.570
This is Dr. Lu.

00:23:44.490 --> 00:23:44.980
Li Wu.

00:23:45.490 --> 00:23:45.860
Hello.

00:23:46.530 --> 00:23:47.090
Hello, Dr. Lu.

00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:51.010
So, about your condition,

00:23:51.010 --> 00:23:51.900
Cen Jin

00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:52.900
had told me a bit.

00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:54.490
But we still need

00:23:54.490 --> 00:23:55.860
to run some tests

00:23:55.977 --> 00:23:57.844
before deciding on a treatment plan.

00:23:58.490 --> 00:24:00.050
How long have you had

00:24:00.111 --> 00:24:01.088
these migraines?

00:24:01.140 --> 00:24:02.660
What treatment have you tried?

00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:06.050
On and off,

00:24:06.050 --> 00:24:07.290
around four to five years.

00:24:08.090 --> 00:24:10.220
I got some meds
from another doctor before.

00:24:10.380 --> 00:24:11.620
But they are mostly painkillers.

00:24:11.770 --> 00:24:13.290
They only relieve the pain

00:24:13.290 --> 00:24:14.311
when it really hurts.

00:24:17.010 --> 00:24:17.380
I see.

00:24:18.490 --> 00:24:19.380
Later,

00:24:19.730 --> 00:24:21.330
send me photos

00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:23.044
of the medications you've taken.

00:24:24.330 --> 00:24:25.700
We'll run a few tests first.

00:24:26.330 --> 00:24:28.620
And you'll need to book an MRI as well.

00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:29.330
Okay.

00:24:30.860 --> 00:24:31.620
Thank you, Dr. Lu.

00:24:32.810 --> 00:24:33.420
You're welcome.

00:24:34.010 --> 00:24:34.980
We're all friends.

00:24:41.810 --> 00:24:42.940
I'm not too busy right now.

00:24:43.511 --> 00:24:45.400
I'll take you to make the appointment.

00:24:45.810 --> 00:24:47.530
After the scan,

00:24:47.530 --> 00:24:49.200
you'll get the result on the same day.

00:24:49.530 --> 00:24:49.900
Let's go.

00:24:51.770 --> 00:24:53.530
The coat you lent me last time.

00:24:53.530 --> 00:24:54.490
I dry-cleaned it

00:24:54.940 --> 00:24:56.330
and brought it back.

00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:00.530
Thank you.

00:25:03.180 --> 00:25:04.330
Who's this guy?

00:25:05.010 --> 00:25:06.420
Cen Jin's boyfriend?

00:25:10.330 --> 00:25:11.180
We'll go by ourselves.

00:25:11.311 --> 00:25:12.555
No need to trouble you.

00:25:13.810 --> 00:25:15.220
Right. Don't let us keep you.

00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:16.090
We'll go by ourselves.

00:25:16.530 --> 00:25:16.940
Sure.

00:25:18.730 --> 00:25:20.290
See you next time, Mr. Lu.

00:25:22.090 --> 00:25:22.660
See you.

00:25:24.620 --> 00:25:25.380
We'll get going.

00:25:25.620 --> 00:25:25.980
Bye-bye.

00:25:26.140 --> 00:25:26.730
Bye-bye.

00:25:32.530 --> 00:25:33.050
Li Wu.

00:25:36.700 --> 00:25:37.700
You left this in the car.

00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:39.460
Thank you.

00:25:40.730 --> 00:25:42.800
Don't forget you have checkups
in a few days.

00:25:43.940 --> 00:25:44.980
Okay. I'm heading off.

00:25:47.140 --> 00:25:47.980
Well...

00:25:50.420 --> 00:25:53.290
Are you busy this Saturday?

00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:56.530
I'm going back to my parents' place.

00:25:59.330 --> 00:25:59.940
Why?

00:26:01.530 --> 00:26:01.980
Nothing.

00:26:03.460 --> 00:26:03.810
I'm off.

00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:04.700
Bye-bye.

00:26:09.420 --> 00:26:11.980
(Going back to her parents' place
this Saturday?)

00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:21.330
Mom, Dad, I'm back.

00:26:21.330 --> 00:26:22.290
What do we have?

00:26:22.460 --> 00:26:23.380
Sister, you're back.

00:26:30.330 --> 00:26:31.220
Why are you here?

00:26:31.755 --> 00:26:33.422
I came to visit Mr. Cen and Mrs. Cen.

00:26:33.777 --> 00:26:34.380
Visit...

00:26:35.180 --> 00:26:37.700
Since we've made peace,
I figured I could come, right?

00:26:37.822 --> 00:26:40.570
Why are you standing here?
Go wash your hands and get ready for lunch.

00:26:40.570 --> 00:26:40.940
Okay.

00:26:44.133 --> 00:26:45.311
Mr. Cen, Mrs. Cen.

00:26:45.860 --> 00:26:46.700
Thank you.

00:26:47.290 --> 00:26:47.770
Thanks.

00:26:52.090 --> 00:26:53.490
Wu, sit here.

00:26:57.660 --> 00:26:58.380
Sit.

00:27:02.620 --> 00:27:03.530
The four of us

00:27:04.090 --> 00:27:05.140
haven't sat down

00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:06.180
for a meal like this

00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:07.010
in a very long time.

00:27:07.900 --> 00:27:08.620
Let's treat it

00:27:08.810 --> 00:27:10.010
as a reunion lunch

00:27:11.140 --> 00:27:12.460
to welcome Wu back.

00:27:13.250 --> 00:27:15.050
If there's anything
you want to eat or drink,

00:27:15.220 --> 00:27:15.980
just tell me.

00:27:16.111 --> 00:27:17.180
I'll make sure you get it.

00:27:17.660 --> 00:27:18.140
Sure.

00:27:18.266 --> 00:27:19.355
Thank you, Mrs. Cen.

00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:20.900
I've been abroad

00:27:20.900 --> 00:27:21.770
these past few years,

00:27:21.770 --> 00:27:23.622
so I haven't had the chance
to see you both.

00:27:23.688 --> 00:27:25.250
But now that I'm back, I'm staying.

00:27:25.490 --> 00:27:26.810
I'll come visit often.

00:27:26.810 --> 00:27:27.700
Good. Dig up.

00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:28.530
Sure. Come on, eat.

00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:29.380
Here.

00:27:36.490 --> 00:27:37.090
Wu,

00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:40.380
how's the startup going?

00:27:41.888 --> 00:27:42.660
It goes pretty well.

00:27:44.420 --> 00:27:46.090
Now, I'm working with

00:27:46.090 --> 00:27:47.711
a few friends who share the same goals.

00:27:48.460 --> 00:27:49.800
And my mentor from abroad

00:27:49.822 --> 00:27:52.220
is helping as our tech consultant.

00:27:52.711 --> 00:27:53.955
Everything's been good.

00:27:54.860 --> 00:27:56.530
I don't know much

00:27:56.955 --> 00:27:58.490
about the environmental AI field,

00:27:59.180 --> 00:28:00.420
but your direction

00:28:00.466 --> 00:28:01.555
sounds great.

00:28:02.570 --> 00:28:04.420
Well, you can't just
bury yourself in work.

00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:05.730
Look at you.

00:28:05.730 --> 00:28:06.660
You're so skinny.

00:28:07.050 --> 00:28:08.380
You need to take care of yourself.

00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:09.140
Here. Eat some meat.

00:28:09.140 --> 00:28:09.700
Right.

00:28:10.290 --> 00:28:10.980
Eat some meat.

00:28:11.022 --> 00:28:11.940
Thank you, Mrs. Cen.

00:28:15.050 --> 00:28:15.530
Wu,

00:28:16.380 --> 00:28:17.530
since you've decided

00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:18.570
to move back for good,

00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:20.220
have you found a place

00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:20.810
to live?

00:28:21.730 --> 00:28:22.490
Not yet.

00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:25.140
I'm staying at a hotel.

00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:28.266
I've contacted the agents,

00:28:28.311 --> 00:28:30.010
but none of the places were ideal.

00:28:30.250 --> 00:28:31.090
Hotel?

00:28:31.290 --> 00:28:32.330
That won't do.

00:28:32.330 --> 00:28:33.330
Too expensive.

00:28:33.330 --> 00:28:34.570
You should find a proper place.

00:28:35.180 --> 00:28:37.940
Also, you need to pick an area

00:28:37.940 --> 00:28:38.900
to search for a place.

00:28:38.933 --> 00:28:39.933
It'll be easier.

00:28:40.980 --> 00:28:42.290
I thought about it.

00:28:42.770 --> 00:28:43.570
I prefer to stay

00:28:43.570 --> 00:28:45.010
in Minwen District.

00:28:45.730 --> 00:28:46.810
It's closer to my office.

00:28:47.050 --> 00:28:47.940
Minwen?

00:28:49.090 --> 00:28:51.250
Jin knows that area.

00:28:51.940 --> 00:28:53.220
Let her recommend something.

00:28:53.810 --> 00:28:55.180
Don't let those agents scam you.

00:28:55.490 --> 00:28:56.010
Wouldn't that

00:28:56.700 --> 00:28:57.330
trouble her

00:28:57.330 --> 00:28:58.380
too much?

00:28:59.311 --> 00:29:01.444
But I'm actually looking at
apartments today.

00:29:01.490 --> 00:29:02.330
Do you have time?

00:29:03.460 --> 00:29:04.180
Of course.

00:29:04.180 --> 00:29:05.050
She has time.

00:29:05.180 --> 00:29:06.010
It's the weekend.

00:29:06.010 --> 00:29:06.530
She has time.

00:29:10.330 --> 00:29:10.810
Yeah.

00:29:12.044 --> 00:29:13.444
Thank you, Sister.

00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:15.660
You should hurry

00:29:15.660 --> 00:29:16.860
and find one.

00:29:16.911 --> 00:29:18.090
The earlier, the better.

00:29:26.250 --> 00:29:27.380
Take a look at this place.

00:29:31.420 --> 00:29:32.090
The furniture

00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:33.010
is nice,

00:29:33.220 --> 00:29:34.420
the decor is classy,

00:29:34.533 --> 00:29:35.490
and the view is good.

00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:37.570
This apartment is excellent.

00:29:38.380 --> 00:29:39.090
What do you think?

00:29:41.530 --> 00:29:42.330
It's nice.

00:29:42.330 --> 00:29:43.050
Look at this sofa.

00:29:52.140 --> 00:29:54.140
It's dim at this hour.

00:29:54.222 --> 00:29:56.177
It'll only get worse
at other times, right?

00:29:57.570 --> 00:29:58.700
Look at this one.

00:29:59.290 --> 00:30:00.290
The view.

00:30:00.620 --> 00:30:01.530
Faces south.

00:30:01.730 --> 00:30:02.860
Top floor.

00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:04.700
The lighting is great.

00:30:05.250 --> 00:30:06.860
You never need to turn on the lights.

00:30:06.860 --> 00:30:07.980
Look. Isn't it bright?

00:30:09.860 --> 00:30:11.940
And the big balcony.

00:30:13.900 --> 00:30:14.530
Sorry.

00:30:15.420 --> 00:30:16.355
What's wrong?

00:30:16.570 --> 00:30:17.660
There's a leak here.

00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:20.530
Look.

00:30:20.860 --> 00:30:21.730
I'm sure

00:30:21.980 --> 00:30:22.940
you'll be satisfied.

00:30:23.420 --> 00:30:24.380
The lighting

00:30:24.570 --> 00:30:26.290
has absolutely no problem.

00:30:26.900 --> 00:30:27.860
Southwest corner unit.

00:30:28.810 --> 00:30:29.860
The decor style

00:30:29.860 --> 00:30:30.620
is great,

00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:32.050
all the furniture is new,

00:30:33.090 --> 00:30:35.180
and there's no leak.

00:30:35.380 --> 00:30:36.860
If you find one leak,

00:30:37.050 --> 00:30:38.090
I'll drink it.

00:30:38.330 --> 00:30:38.770
Okay?

00:30:39.111 --> 00:30:40.355
Take your time and look around.

00:30:40.460 --> 00:30:41.530
How's this one?

00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:42.660
Look.

00:30:43.810 --> 00:30:44.380
Not bad.

00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:45.250
It's fine, right?

00:30:45.250 --> 00:30:46.244
I think it's okay too.

00:30:57.860 --> 00:31:01.020
(Home Renovation Notice)

00:31:05.860 --> 00:31:06.290
Miss.

00:31:06.530 --> 00:31:06.980
Mister.

00:31:08.090 --> 00:31:08.730
If even this one

00:31:08.730 --> 00:31:09.770
doesn't work,

00:31:09.770 --> 00:31:11.050
I really don't have

00:31:11.050 --> 00:31:11.860
any other listings.

00:31:14.380 --> 00:31:15.570
If that's the case,

00:31:15.933 --> 00:31:17.666
maybe I should switch
to another district.

00:31:18.010 --> 00:31:19.250
I don't mind a longer commute.

00:31:22.420 --> 00:31:22.940
You really

00:31:22.940 --> 00:31:24.010
don't have anything else?

00:31:24.330 --> 00:31:25.220
Let me ask.

00:31:28.570 --> 00:31:28.980
Got it.

00:31:29.066 --> 00:31:29.819
My colleague says

00:31:29.820 --> 00:31:31.422
there's a new unit
that has just opened up.

00:31:31.444 --> 00:31:32.530
It's not in the system yet.

00:31:32.533 --> 00:31:34.000
It's a very popular neighborhood.

00:31:34.330 --> 00:31:35.420
Do you want to

00:31:35.980 --> 00:31:36.770
go take a look?

00:31:38.770 --> 00:31:39.420
Shall we?

00:31:45.180 --> 00:31:46.090
The apartment

00:31:46.220 --> 00:31:47.250
has an elegant decor,

00:31:47.250 --> 00:31:48.180
the layout is good,

00:31:48.330 --> 00:31:49.290
high ceilings,

00:31:49.355 --> 00:31:51.088
and the design details are done well.

00:31:51.620 --> 00:31:52.380
The neighborhood

00:31:52.380 --> 00:31:53.220
we saw earlier

00:31:53.220 --> 00:31:54.860
is beautiful

00:31:54.860 --> 00:31:55.860
and serene.

00:31:57.730 --> 00:32:00.050
I don't think this is a good place.

00:32:00.530 --> 00:32:02.660
Why not?

00:32:07.700 --> 00:32:09.290
Maybe I should just stay in the hotel.

00:32:10.290 --> 00:32:11.290
No, don't.

00:32:11.466 --> 00:32:12.620
I've been running around

00:32:12.620 --> 00:32:13.660
these past few days.

00:32:13.940 --> 00:32:14.980
Give it another thought.

00:32:15.570 --> 00:32:17.330
If you stay in a hotel, you can't cook.

00:32:17.660 --> 00:32:19.666
Eating too much takeout
is bad for your health.

00:32:19.810 --> 00:32:20.490
Besides,

00:32:20.660 --> 00:32:21.660
you won't feel settled

00:32:21.660 --> 00:32:23.155
staying in a hotel all the time.

00:32:23.266 --> 00:32:24.466
It's like drifting around.

00:32:24.660 --> 00:32:25.730
Watching people

00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:26.955
come and go every day,

00:32:27.050 --> 00:32:28.466
you can't sleep well either.

00:32:28.860 --> 00:32:30.330
You need a place

00:32:30.330 --> 00:32:31.250
to settle down

00:32:31.460 --> 00:32:32.980
so you can eat well and sleep well.

00:32:33.730 --> 00:32:34.444
I mean it!

00:32:42.530 --> 00:32:43.530
Don't stay in a hotel.

00:32:44.111 --> 00:32:45.570
If you think this place works for you,

00:32:45.570 --> 00:32:46.444
just sign the paper.

00:32:47.222 --> 00:32:48.250
I'll head back first.

00:33:11.250 --> 00:33:11.730
Mister,

00:33:13.140 --> 00:33:14.380
did I do a good job?

00:33:15.490 --> 00:33:16.511
I'll pay you extra.

00:33:16.810 --> 00:33:18.010
Alright. Thanks.

00:33:22.220 --> 00:33:23.570
This is way too fast.

00:33:24.660 --> 00:33:26.250
He just rented the place,

00:33:26.860 --> 00:33:28.420
and now he's already moving in.

00:33:31.180 --> 00:33:32.250
You're glued to the door.

00:33:32.620 --> 00:33:33.810
Did you come over here

00:33:33.810 --> 00:33:34.980
just to watch him move in?

00:33:36.460 --> 00:33:37.250
Stop staring.

00:33:37.250 --> 00:33:38.777
It'll be awkward if he sees you.

00:33:48.250 --> 00:33:49.180
Thank you.

00:33:55.620 --> 00:33:56.570
Why do you think

00:33:56.570 --> 00:33:57.530
he's doing all this?

00:33:59.860 --> 00:34:01.140
You two just made peace,

00:34:01.380 --> 00:34:02.900
and now he moves right across from you.

00:34:03.810 --> 00:34:04.940
You fell for his trap.

00:34:05.730 --> 00:34:06.660
He's changed.

00:34:07.088 --> 00:34:08.955
He knows how to play the victim now.

00:34:09.340 --> 00:34:10.490
So what are you going to do?

00:34:15.090 --> 00:34:16.530
I just want to

00:34:16.530 --> 00:34:17.740
help him get his health back.

00:34:18.420 --> 00:34:19.210
As for the rest,

00:34:19.933 --> 00:34:21.288
I don't have any thoughts.

00:34:26.780 --> 00:34:29.010
This guy is really something.

00:34:29.690 --> 00:34:30.420
Who?

00:34:33.530 --> 00:34:34.860
The guy I told you about before.

00:34:35.090 --> 00:34:36.610
Li Wu's friend.

00:34:37.610 --> 00:34:39.170
I added him on WeChat,

00:34:39.170 --> 00:34:40.690
and he ignored my request.

00:34:43.130 --> 00:34:44.050
That's rare.

00:34:44.490 --> 00:34:46.050
I've never seen you care so much.

00:34:50.860 --> 00:34:51.650
It's Li Wu.

00:34:58.010 --> 00:34:58.940
You're here.

00:34:59.530 --> 00:35:00.340
Come on in.

00:35:07.170 --> 00:35:07.900
Well...

00:35:08.130 --> 00:35:09.380
My car's restricted today,

00:35:09.422 --> 00:35:10.490
and there's nothing at home.

00:35:10.490 --> 00:35:11.755
I need to go buy some things.

00:35:11.755 --> 00:35:12.444
I was wondering...

00:35:13.210 --> 00:35:14.860
if I could borrow your car.

00:35:17.740 --> 00:35:19.200
One sec. I'll grab the key.

00:35:19.266 --> 00:35:20.420
What key?

00:35:20.420 --> 00:35:21.210
Go with him.

00:35:21.210 --> 00:35:22.260
Help him pick things out.

00:35:25.170 --> 00:35:26.490
I'm doing laundry.

00:35:29.210 --> 00:35:30.300
I'll wash it for you.

00:35:30.490 --> 00:35:31.300
He just got back.

00:35:31.300 --> 00:35:32.422
He doesn't know this area.

00:35:32.466 --> 00:35:33.533
You should help him more.

00:35:36.570 --> 00:35:38.300
Is that okay for you now?

00:35:41.300 --> 00:35:41.860
Of course.

00:35:43.420 --> 00:35:45.170
Alright, I will change my shoes.

00:36:08.820 --> 00:36:09.900
This one seems pretty good.

00:36:09.900 --> 00:36:11.066
Do you want to try it?

00:36:22.170 --> 00:36:22.610
It's fine.

00:36:22.900 --> 00:36:23.820
Bedding is important.

00:36:23.820 --> 00:36:24.650
Take your time.

00:36:29.930 --> 00:36:31.377
What mattress was I sleeping on

00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:32.490
back at your place?

00:36:37.170 --> 00:36:38.090
I don't remember.

00:36:40.780 --> 00:36:42.690
Honestly, that's still
the bed I slept best in

00:36:42.690 --> 00:36:43.690
all these years.

00:36:52.650 --> 00:36:53.420
Hello.

00:36:53.740 --> 00:36:55.650
This is our latest model.

00:36:55.650 --> 00:36:57.511
The core uses
individually pocketed springs.

00:36:58.090 --> 00:36:59.090
If you get up at night,

00:36:59.090 --> 00:37:00.460
you won't disturb your partner.

00:37:00.755 --> 00:37:02.888
You can both lie down
in your usual sleeping positions

00:37:02.888 --> 00:37:03.688
to try it out.

00:37:06.980 --> 00:37:08.460
I'm buying it.

00:37:10.170 --> 00:37:11.170
Sorry.

00:37:11.380 --> 00:37:12.300
Sir, do you have

00:37:12.300 --> 00:37:13.444
any specific requirements?

00:37:13.690 --> 00:37:14.420
Please follow me.

00:37:28.860 --> 00:37:30.260
It's pretty comfy.

00:37:31.177 --> 00:37:32.444
Something's wrong with him.

00:37:42.066 --> 00:37:43.260
(Roman Holiday)
Do you remember

00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:44.210
we watched this before?

00:37:50.210 --> 00:37:50.860
Yeah.

00:37:51.610 --> 00:37:53.490
I was teaching you English back then.

00:37:55.820 --> 00:37:56.380
Yeah.

00:37:57.610 --> 00:37:58.460
It's been a long time.

00:38:01.490 --> 00:38:03.130
Lately, I keep thinking about the past.

00:38:06.650 --> 00:38:07.260
Yeah.

00:38:08.650 --> 00:38:09.490
It's been a while.

00:38:11.460 --> 00:38:12.650
A lot of things have changed.

00:38:14.300 --> 00:38:15.530
Some things haven't.

00:38:22.210 --> 00:38:22.900
Actually...

00:38:25.511 --> 00:38:26.420
You've always been

00:38:26.420 --> 00:38:27.911
the most important person to me.

00:38:28.940 --> 00:38:30.210
That hasn't changed at all.

00:38:34.780 --> 00:38:35.300
Sister,

00:38:36.610 --> 00:38:37.260
I get it now.

00:38:38.155 --> 00:38:40.244
I wouldn't be who I am today
without you.

00:38:41.380 --> 00:38:43.050
When I first went abroad,

00:38:43.050 --> 00:38:44.010
I couldn't understand

00:38:44.900 --> 00:38:46.010
why we had to part.

00:38:49.288 --> 00:38:50.900
But after seeing more of the world,

00:38:51.570 --> 00:38:52.690
I slowly understood

00:38:54.050 --> 00:38:56.980
the world you wanted me to see.

00:39:06.130 --> 00:39:06.650
Sorry.

00:39:08.300 --> 00:39:09.130
When I said

00:39:10.690 --> 00:39:13.090
I hated you,

00:39:14.460 --> 00:39:15.650
it was because I was scared.

00:39:16.010 --> 00:39:16.940
I didn't mean it.

00:39:20.610 --> 00:39:21.570
You told me to let go

00:39:21.570 --> 00:39:22.800
because it was good for me.

00:39:23.610 --> 00:39:24.340
One can't

00:39:24.340 --> 00:39:25.530
hold on to the past forever.

00:39:27.900 --> 00:39:29.090
I should let it go too

00:39:29.780 --> 00:39:30.570
and live my life.

00:39:49.820 --> 00:39:50.420
Thank you.

00:39:53.210 --> 00:39:53.900
