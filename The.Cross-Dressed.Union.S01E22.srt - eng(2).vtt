00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:55.120
Everyone,

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.280
join me to drive back the enemy!

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:59.600
Defend our border city,

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.000
protect Ling An!

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:02.760
We are willing!

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.320
We are willing!

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.440
Though dead, the spirit is divine;

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.480
the soul, a hero among ghosts.

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:33.880
You all follow my elder brother,

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.200
Nan Chenxiao,

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.640
valiant warriors on the battlefield.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:40.680
With burning passion,

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.520
it should be shed on the field.

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.000
The enemy invades.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:50.560
At the brink of survival,

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.720
who will join me to fight?

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.880
We are willing!

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:00.520
We are willing!

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:03.760
Open the city gates!

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:05.280
Prepare for battle!

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.400
Attack!

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.840
General Nan guards our city gate.

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.000
Soldiers shed blood for us on the field.

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.160
We must not be their burden.

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.200
Let's move out!

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:23.240
Grand General.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:30.720
Chong Ming.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:35.440
Chong Ming.

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:37.480
Chong Ming.

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:39.520
Me too.

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.240
A military officer of the nation.

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:42.600
In this life,

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.840
to fight on the battlefield,

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:46.040
I am

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:47.480
without regret.

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:51.560
Tell Your Majesty

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:53.880
not to grieve.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.680
Our soldiers' blood won't be shed in vain.

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:00.960
It nourishes the land of Ling An.

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:02.880
For generations,

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:04.840
we hope

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:06.880
for the Military Imperial Examination.

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:07.520
Chong Ming.

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:35.280
The day after tomorrow,

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.160
I will go to the altar to pray.

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:38.360
You leave the city

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:40.200
to negotiate with Pan Zi Zhai.

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:41.880
Your humble servant

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:43.520
will not fail the mission.

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:04.840
Why are you here?

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:08.240
I asked Lord Rui

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:09.880
to let me be your escort.

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:13.080
You don't have to do this.

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:15.920
Your Majesty can treat me as a regular guard.

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:17.600
Please go inside and rest.

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:19.400
There are many tasks for the blessing ceremony.

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:21.080
It's bound to be exhausting.

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:23.080
I...

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:39.080
Morning views the sky, evening sees clouds.

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:43.280
I wonder how things are in Pingxiang.

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:46.600
With Young Master Nan there,

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:47.880
victory is assured.

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:53.440
I recall Lord Liu

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:55.280
was exiled to Jiaozhou City.

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:57.840
Why isn't he among the officials

00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:59.400
receiving us this time?

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:02.080
Should I go investigate?

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:06.480
Maybe I'm overthinking.

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:07.960
He was exiled here,

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:09.280
likely ostracized.

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:11.160
When this is over,

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:12.640
I'll visit him.

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:21.040
Everyone, keep up!

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:25.440
Everyone, hurry up!

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:26.760
Hold on a bit longer.

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:28.520
We'll rest at the next prefecture.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.280
Everyone, keep up!

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:49.280
Everyone, keep up!

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:50.560
Hurry up, everyone!

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:52.480
Keep up!

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:53.360
Watch your step.

00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:56.440
Are you alright?

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:03.320
We've walked all night.

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:05.080
These people are elderly, women, and children.

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:06.360
We should rest.

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:09.960
No.

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:12.320
We must reach the next prefecture quickly.

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:14.040
If the border city falls,

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:16.840
the enemy will catch up to us soon.

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:17.960
By then,

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:20.480
these people will suffer.

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:25.520
Folks,

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:27.200
hold on a bit longer.

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:29.320
Once we reach the next prefecture, we can rest.

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:32.040
Hold on a bit longer.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:38.680
Everyone, keep up!

00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:39.640
Hold on a bit longer.

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:04.440
We will get everyone to safety.

00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:12.960
Thank you, Yan Luo.

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:15.000
Aren't you afraid?

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:20.680
I've lived in the palace for years,

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:21.880
unaware of the world.

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:24.120
Now the land is troubled,

00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:26.040
soldiers fight bravely.

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:28.880
Only now do I see their courage.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
They shed blood for the nation and the people.

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:35.720
As Ling An's princess,

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:37.240
how can I be afraid?

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:38.760
I must face danger head-on

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:40.040
and stand with the soldiers.

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:47.600
Thank you.

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:51.440
Let's go.

00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:56.040
Go.

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:16.120
Are you tired?

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:17.760
Do you want to rest?

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:26.440
Brother.

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:38.000
It's only been a day,

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:41.440
the people aren't safe yet.

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:45.320
We can't rest.

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:25.520
Let me see your Nanjia Spear skills.

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:48.280
The enemy is coming.

00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:49.560
Aren't you afraid?

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:54.000
You once said

00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:56.320
we Nan sons

00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:57.960
fear no hardship,

00:11:58.880 --> 00:11:59.680
nor danger.

00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:06.000
You truly are my good brother.

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:08.920
I'll fight by your side to the end.

00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:12.760
As a child, I never understood

00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:16.760
how you could risk your life so easily,

00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:18.600
leaving our parents and me behind.

00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:21.360
What was it all for?

00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:27.200
Now I understand.

00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:30.200
All we can do

00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:35.240
is protect the innocent in every city

00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:37.560
from needless suffering.

00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:41.680
If I could use myself

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:43.600
to bring peace to a place,

00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:47.280
no matter how I think about it,

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:49.080
it's a fair trade.

00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:50.280
Right?

00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:56.520
The wind rises from the tip of green reeds,

00:12:57.680 --> 00:12:59.160
waves form from the smallest ripples.

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:01.600
Even in the depths, flowers must bloom.

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:03.800
Even at the ocean's floor, one seeks the moon.

00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:06.280
Instead of cursing the darkness,

00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:09.240
it's better to carry a lantern forward.

00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:13.480
Everything in this world has cause and effect.

00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:15.280
If there's no way out,

00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:17.120
we

00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:18.960
will fight to carve one ourselves.

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:22.640
The path lies before us.

00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:28.520
If we leave and never return,

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:31.560
then so be it.

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:01.800
Brother Nan, I arrived late.

00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:03.200
Young Master Nan,

00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:04.640
we're here.

00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:05.960
Hyah!

00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:06.960
Not late.

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:08.000
Just in time.

00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:09.080
Hyah!

00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:16.680
They're here.

00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:18.600
Now I can rest easy.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:32.480
Hyah!

00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:33.920
Hyah!

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:36.920
Hyah!

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:38.920
Hyah!

00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:40.560
Hyah!

00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:42.320
Hyah!

00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:55.360
On this journey,

00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:56.720
I must travel a thousand li each day.

00:14:57.520 --> 00:14:58.600
I can't afford any delay.

00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:00.960
White Horse,

00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:02.760
I'm counting on you.

00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:07.160
Hyah!

00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:09.000
Hyah!

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.360
You owe me a big favor this time.

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:22.200
Brother, your kindness

00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:25.240
I thank you on behalf of the border town.

00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:27.400
You only say that.

00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:31.520
I helped you drive out Dayue.

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:33.800
Isn't that you repaying my favor?

00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:35.280
We're even now.

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:36.920
Brother hasn't said anything.

00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:39.000
Royal Sister, don't fuss with me.

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:41.200
Royal Brother, look at him.

00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:44.400
General.

00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:45.960
The Grand General has taken the city.

00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:46.880
Hou Qi has been captured.

00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:48.920
Lord Fushan has taken over Hou Qi's troops.

00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:50.280
They're clearing out the rebels now.

00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:51.920
The Grand General can return tonight.

00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:53.640
That's excellent.

00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:55.600
We'll return to the capital soon.

00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:56.720
General.

00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:01.440
You two talk.

00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:03.080
Speak freely.

00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:04.440
General, reporting.

00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:06.600
Pan Zi Zhai has stationed troops outside Jiaozhou City.

00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:09.360
Your Majesty and Lord Rui went to Jiaozhou City to negotiate with Qian Yuan.

00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:11.440
It's been two days by now.

00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:12.560
But at the border town,

00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:14.320
there's not a single word of news.

00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:15.520
And our people

00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:17.200
have all lost contact.

00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:18.480
What?

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:31.320
Prince Pan.

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:33.200
Long time no see.

00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:38.120
Give Lord Rui a seat.

00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:38.960
Lord Rui.

00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:41.200
Please.

00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:52.840
Yan Lin.

00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:55.720
So they sent you as envoy after all.

00:16:57.320 --> 00:16:58.720
I have family ties with the Prince.

00:16:59.160 --> 00:16:59.920
For this matter,

00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:01.560
I'm the best choice.

00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:05.280
Lord Rui.

00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:09.880
Thank you.

00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:14.960
The Prince is engaged to Ling An's princess.

00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:17.120
That makes him family with Ling An.

00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:20.600
Now you've taken the Ling An negotiation.

00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:21.880
This family tie

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:23.600
isn't worth much now.

00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:24.800
Second Prince.

00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:26.640
He must be pleased to see this.

00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:30.760
My father's order—

00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:32.640
as his son,

00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:35.080
I should share his burdens.

00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:39.920
I know the pain of leaving home.

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:42.080
And I know returning to Qian Yuan

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:43.800
means facing hardship.

00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:45.320
How about

00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:47.240
I help the Prince negotiate?

00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:48.520
With Ling An's help,

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:50.000
the Second Prince

00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:52.120
won't trouble the Prince.

00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:56.240
I only command Qian Yuan's border troops now.

00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:58.080
Lord Rui, do you think

00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:01.200
I have any other troubles?

00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:04.640
But when I entered the camp,

00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:07.200
there were barely a thousand border troops.

00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:09.440
Does the Prince plan to use these thousand

00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:11.280
to take Jiaozhou City?

00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:14.560
From what I know of Ling An's cities,

00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:15.920
Jiaozhou City

00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:17.280
is easy to defend

00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:18.440
and hard to attack.

00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:21.680
Plus, the city was reinforced last year.

00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:23.280
Even if

00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:25.520
you gather a large army,

00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:28.080
you can't take the city easily.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.240
Ling An's troops

00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:36.400
are now under Pingxiang's control.

00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:39.960
I may not fail.

00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:46.120
If the Prince is trapped by war,

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:48.840
won't the Second Prince target you

00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:50.240
and steal your military merit?

00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:51.920
After all,

00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:53.400
the Second Prince

00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:55.600
is the most favored son.

00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:05.440
Prince, what do you mean by this?

00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:06.760
Lord Rui,

00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:09.200
you're so clever,

00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:11.960
you've guessed my troubles,

00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:14.040
but haven't guessed

00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:17.800
why I've held my troops back?

00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:37.120
Qian Yuan—

00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:38.800
why are there people from Hongli Island?

00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:39.840
Hongli Island

00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:42.640
Hongli Island rarely interacts with outsiders.

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:45.280
I've only read about them in travel notes.

00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:47.320
If not for the envoy's visit before the mission,

00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:48.600
when an envoy came,

00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:49.920
they'd be hard to recognize.

00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:52.480
How are they connected to Pan Zi Zhai?

00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:54.640
Could it be

00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:56.320
he wants to borrow troops?

00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:05.800
Lord Rui

00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:10.920
Prince Pan, what do you mean by this?

00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:12.520
His Highness thought

00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:14.200
Lord Rui would be staying here for a while

00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:15.920
and might not have suitable clothes

00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:18.160
so he ordered me to prepare a dress for you

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:21.760
The prince detains a foreign envoy

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:23.400
and even intends to humiliate

00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:26.320
You'd better just comply

00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:27.720
Otherwise, some news

00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:29.600
might never reach you

00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:35.520
Guard the entrance well

00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:36.360
Yes, yes

00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:45.120
What news could they possibly have?

00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:48.240
Pan Zi Zhai is being so deliberate

00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:50.520
It must be about Nan Chenxiao

00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:52.880
Could it be...

00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:42.960
For ages, beauty is unmatched

00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:45.920
A pleasing sight is a fair lady

00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:48.000
If you have something to say, just say it

00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:52.760
Let me tell you a story

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:56.400
The third young lady of the Rui family

00:21:56.920 --> 00:21:59.120
Dressed as a man, she entered officialdom

00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:01.400
Revived the stagnant Rui family

00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:04.040
If it were written as a play

00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:07.200
it would be the most popular act

00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:11.560
I don't understand

00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:13.680
Lord Rui

00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:16.480
We haven't even had a drink yet

00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:25.480
As expected

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:27.600
I've always thought

00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:28.960
you're special

00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:32.400
Don't you want to know if Nan Chenxiao is alive?

00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:40.040
I remember you can play the zither

00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:42.200
Play a tune for me

00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:44.800
Your Highness remembers wrong

00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:45.960
I can't

00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:46.720
You can

00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:48.680
I heard you play as a child

00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:50.720
You played

00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:53.120
Qingqing Zijing

00:22:56.640 --> 00:22:57.680
How do you know that?

00:22:58.160 --> 00:22:59.200
I told you

00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:03.440
We met before my aunt married into the Rui family

00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:06.440
Play a song for me

00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:08.320
and I'll tell you what you want to know

00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:09.800
How about it?

00:23:58.160 --> 00:23:59.840
You're just Qian Yuan's castoff

00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:01.720
Show some respect when you see us

00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:02.440
Understand? Did you hear me?

00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:03.760
You bring bad luck

00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:04.240
That's right

00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:06.000
It's a long-lost national essay

00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:07.960
Why would a castoff like you read this?

00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:08.960
It's mine now

00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:10.360
No, no way

00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:11.440
My mother gave it to me

00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:12.040
You all

00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:13.520
Return the book to the young prince

00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:16.440
Your father is just a fourth-rank official

00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:17.600
And you think you can order me?

00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:19.400
Your Majesty always rules with courtesy

00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:21.200
You bully others with your power

00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:22.760
Are you ignoring the laws of the land?

00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:25.480
You're just the crown prince's study companion

00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:26.400
Why act so arrogant?

00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:27.920
Believe I'll tell the crown prince?

00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:34.640
Why aren't you leaving?

00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:38.040
Get up

00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:42.280
Keep your book safe

00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:44.600
Don't let it get snatched again

00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:57.040
I'll be back soon

00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:11.680
Now in my eyes

00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:13.640
Tomorrow in my heart

00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:14.920
The day after, on my brow

00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:18.400
I'll wait for your return

00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:30.040
What's wrong?

00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:34.360
I haven't played in ages

00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:36.160
I can't play the rest

00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:41.920
Now

00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:43.760
Ling An is like a trapped beast

00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:46.080
You should come to Qian Yuan

00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:47.800
If you want to be an official

00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:50.200
I'll make you chief among all officials

00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:52.120
If you don't want that

00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:56.680
I'll make you Qian Yuan's most honored woman

00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:01.600
The prince has been a hostage for nineteen years

00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:05.160
You must know the pain of exile best

00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:10.240
Can you really bear to use the blood of two peoples

00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:12.000
to pave your path to the throne?

00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:15.720
A general's triumph is built on ten thousand bones

00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:18.480
Let alone one who ascends as emperor

00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:21.560
If this battle is lost

00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:23.360
it will be your fault

00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:25.000
You'll bear a lifetime of infamy

00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:27.480
Even victory brings no honor

00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:28.920
The crime of patricide

00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:30.880
Can you bear it?

00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:34.680
Do you really think you can silence the masses?

00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:41.560
If I cared about rumors

00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:43.400
I'd have killed myself in Qian Yuan Palace long ago

00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:45.360
And never become a hostage in Ling An

00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:46.440
Infamy

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.360
is just the words of ants

00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:57.120
Have you ever suffered humiliation?

00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:04.280
If those self-righteous people

00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:06.920
lord over you and flaunt their power

00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:08.280
and treat you as worthless

00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:08.760
Then

00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:11.240
would you still think this way?

00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:16.000
I don't want innocent lives

00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:18.880
I'm seeking for them

00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:23.040
a ruler who can truly lead them further

00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:34.600
I don't expect to persuade you

00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:36.760
That's all I have to say

00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:40.120
The song is finished

00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:41.760
Your Highness, it's time to keep your promise

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:49.440
Nan Chenxiao led troops to battle

00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:53.200
My men found his trail and set an ambush

00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:55.080
He's already dead

00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:56.560
Impossible

00:27:58.440 --> 00:27:59.840
He was clearly in Pingxiang

00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:02.800
How did he know I was imprisoned?

00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:15.200
You leaked the news

00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:18.960
What a pity

00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:22.880
I wanted him to die on our wedding day

00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:25.720
But life always has regrets

00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:27.960
Let the news of his death

00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:29.880
become our

00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:32.240
wedding night gift

00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:33.880
How about that?

00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:38.560
All you'll get is my corpse

00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:40.880
Does that mean anything?

00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:43.280
What's so good about him?

00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:45.240
Does that coward deserve you?

00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:48.560
Can he give you the world like I can?

00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:51.080
He and I are truly in love

00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:54.040
Even if he's just a commoner

00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:56.280
Even if he's a beggar

00:28:57.040 --> 00:28:58.760
I wouldn't mind at all

00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:01.600
Fine

00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:05.080
You want to die, don't you?

00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:07.400
I won't let you die

00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:09.520
I'll make sure you live well

00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:12.480
I'll put Nan Chenxiao's corpse on the city wall

00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:14.120
so you see it day and night

00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:15.280
Pan Zi Zhai

00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:20.000
Let go of me

00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:21.640
Let me go

00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:25.960
Chenxiao

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:34.760
I am the Prince of Qian Yuan.

00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:37.240
You don't dare kill me.

00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:41.080
Pan Zi Zhai.

00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:42.800
I want your miserable life.

00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:11.280
Nan Chenxiao.

00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:26.200
I'm a friend of Young Master Nan,
go quickly!

00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:27.280
Fulu.

00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:29.120
Young Master.

00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:33.160
Split up.

00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:34.160
Meet at the border town.

00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:34.880
Okay.

00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:36.840
Go! Go!

00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:53.240
Prince.

00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:54.680
Should we pursue?

00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:00.120
Pursue.

00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:01.600
Go.

00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:03.120
Go.

00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:14.760
Up ahead.

00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:15.440
Over there.

00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:16.480
Saw them run this way.

00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:17.760
Chase them here.

00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:26.160
Go check over there.

00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:26.800
Yes.

00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:27.520
Hurry.

00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:31.960
Look carefully.

00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:35.080
Nothing.

00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:36.680
Check here again.

00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:37.200
Yes.

00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:46.600
It was like this at the cliff too.

00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:48.920
To escape Pan Zi Zhai's men,

00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:50.400
barely made it out alive.

00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:52.440
This time,

00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:54.640
there's no cliff or dead end.

00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:00.080
Go.

00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:13.000
Me like this,

00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:14.720
isn't it strange?

00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:16.080
What's strange about it?

00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:17.920
You look great, honestly.

00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:28.280
I still haven't processed it.

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:29.720
How did you

00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:31.520
suddenly show up in Qian Yuan?

00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:36.800
I heard Pan Zi Zhai took you.

00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:38.840
How could I be at ease?

00:32:40.360 --> 00:32:43.080
So you just left the Pingxiang battle behind?

00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:44.960
What if it's a trap?

00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:47.440
The Pingxiang battle is settled.

00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:50.400
Just some minor matters left to handle.

00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:52.560
When I heard you were trapped,

00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:54.280
how could I stay calm?

00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:01.480
Lord Rui values the people above himself.

00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:04.840
How could I not know what's important?

00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:07.840
I didn't mean to blame you.

00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:10.840
The moment I saw you,

00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:13.800
I wasn't afraid of anything anymore.

00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:16.120
With you here,

00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:18.120
life and death

00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:19.960
don't seem so important.

00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:31.920
Tomorrow,

00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:34.920
Your Majesty will go to the altar to pray.

00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:38.720
Pan Zi Zhai has only a thousand men.

00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:40.200
Why

00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:42.280
would he take such a risk?

00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:46.360
I just thought of that.

00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:49.040
If he doesn't mean to start a war,

00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:51.800
then this move is

00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:55.760
to lure Your Majesty to Jiaozhou City.

00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:00.360
No wonder he made such a show of courting Miss Ming.

00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:01.960
He wants Ming to help him from inside.

00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:02.920
And

00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:04.360
he's asked Hongli Island for troops.

00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:06.560
Liu Zhi's whereabouts are unknown.

00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:08.640
Jiaozhou City may already be...

00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:13.360
Do you remember where the altar is?

00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:14.400
I remember.

00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:16.080
I've seen Jiaozhou City's defense map.

00:34:16.160 --> 00:34:16.880
I'll draw it for you.

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:17.560
Okay.

00:34:28.160 --> 00:34:28.880
Here.

00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:33.960
I still need to send a letter to Hongli Island.

00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:35.520
Can you get into the city?

00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:37.520
Leave it to me.

00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:16.560
Trembling before Heaven,

00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:18.920
shining down on the earth.

00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:21.520
We look up to the holy spirits.

00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:24.160
Set the heart for Heaven and Earth.

00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:26.360
Set destiny for all people.

00:35:26.920 --> 00:35:28.040
For all generations,

00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:29.760
bring peace.

00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:32.520
Safe and tranquil.

00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:34.160
We worship.

00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:36.280
Spirits of the earth.

00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:37.520
and

00:35:37.960 --> 00:35:39.760
great deeds and transformation.

00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:42.120
Bless all generations.

00:35:43.640 --> 00:35:45.680
Offer sacrifice.

00:35:46.160 --> 00:35:47.480
May Ling An

00:35:47.680 --> 00:35:49.240
be prosperous and peaceful.

00:35:49.520 --> 00:35:51.520
Peace under Heaven.

00:36:37.160 --> 00:36:37.640
Not good.

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:38.640
It's an ambush.

00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:39.720
Protect Your Majesty!

00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:41.320
Protect Your Majesty!

00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:43.680
Kill!

00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:44.640
Protect Your Majesty!
